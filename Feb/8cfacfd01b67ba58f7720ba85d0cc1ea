The management of Veritas University, Abuja, on Wednesday said it was investigating a video that showed a lecturer of the school shaving the hair of a student in the classroom. The spokesperson for the institution, Evelyn Obekpa, disclosed this in an interview with our correspondent in Abuja. The PUNCH reports that a viral video had revealed a yet-to-be identified lecturer of the institution shaving the hair of a male student with a pair of scissors in a classroom. Though the cause of the lecturer’s action had not been disclosed, the school vowed to launch an investigation into the matter. Obekpa said, “We are aware of the video. However, we are investigating the incident.” The PUNCH reports that some Nigerian university lecturers have been caught on camera at different times shaving the hairs of male and female students alike during school hours. In January 2020, a lecturer at the Enugu State University of Technology was caught on camera shaving the hair of a male student with a razor blade. In June 2021, another video of a lecturer at the Kogi State University surfaced online. The lecturer was seen moving around the campus and shaving the hair of some male students which he deemed inappropriate. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
