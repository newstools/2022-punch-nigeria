A former Executive Director of Total Nigeria Plc, Dr. Jefferson Nnamani, has said his motivation to join partisan politics is to reform the politicsn of Enugu State. Nnamani, according to a statement on Sunday, was quoted to have said this while announcing his membership of the All Progressives Grand Alliance recently. He said it was unfortunate that after 23 years of the current political dispensation, career politicians who have been in the position of authority have failed to make citizens proud of their state. He said, “It is time to institute a truly people-centred approach to governance in order for the state to take its deserved position as the pride of the Igbo race. “Enugu citizens must shake off political apathy and become more involved; leaders have to be subjected to more accountability on how they use the state’s resources. “Governance should always be about the people, because the resources of state belong to the people and government is only in place to administer such resources on the people’s behalf. Citizens must insist on and work to enthrone good governance. “My choosing to join APGA is because it is the only political party that truly connects to the Ndi Igbo aspiration for socio-economic development in all ramifications. It is not an alternative; it is the only option for the reclamation and reformation of our dear Enugu state,” Nnamani added. A former chairman of APGA in Enugu State, Chief Okechukwu Nkoloagu, said the party and the state are truly on the way to a new dispensation.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
