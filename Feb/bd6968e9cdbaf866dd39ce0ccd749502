The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), transmitted the 2022 Appropriation Act (Amendment) Bill to the National Assembly. Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, announced transmission of the Federal Government’s supplementary budget at the opening of plenary on Tuesday. Though Gbajabiamila did not read out the content of the six-page executive bill, it is expected to contain a provision for the payment of subsidy on Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, for an additional 18 months. The government had made a U-turn on its plan to end the subsidy regime in June. Details later… Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
