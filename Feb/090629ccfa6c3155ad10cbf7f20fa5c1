Victor Osimhen will come up against Inter defender Milan Skriniar for the first time in three months when Napoli host Inter Milan in a Serie A clash on Saturday (today), PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The Nigerian striker broke his cheekbone and eye socket after a nasty clash of heads with Skriniar as Napoli lost 3-2 to Inter at the San Siro last November – an injury which ruled him for 10 weeks. Saturday’s clash will offer the Eagles forward who only just returned to active football featuring in three appearances (two substitute appearances and one start) a chance to banish the memories of the horrific injury by outwitting the Slovakian defender in the game. Speaking ahead of the game, Osimhen recalled the traumatic experience stating that he felt his head explode. “I immediately felt like my face had exploded. As soon as I touched my left cheek I had no feeling left. I also had trouble sleeping, if I turned to that side, it hurt,” he told Tuttosports. “But I regained my strength. I’m not the type to restrain my passion, I’ve never let this kind of thing hold me back and on the contrary, I try to get right back on my feet without feeling sorry for myself.” Osimhen has netted 10 times in 17 appearances so far this season and is reportedly a target for a host of Premier League clubs.
