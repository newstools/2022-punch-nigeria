A group known as Godswill Akpabio Uncommon Transformational Support Organisation has called on former Akwa Ibom State Governor, Godswill Akpabio, to contest for the presidency in 2023. The group’s spokesperson, Bennett Akar, made this call in a statement on Tuesday, adding that the country has reached a stage where it can no longer gamble with its future. He said, “We have looked at all the people who have so far declared their interest in the Presidency and we have come to the unimpeachable conclusion that there is none that has Senator Godswill Akpabio’s political profile and track record of achievements. “Nigeria needs an experienced, tested and steady hand as its pilot at this point in time because one of the biggest challenges Nigeria is facing at the moment is insecurity. “When the Niger Delta militancy was at its peak, Akpabio was one of those patriotic Nigerians who braved the odds, stepped into the ring and found this win-win solution that has held the region at peace till today. He has demonstrated his political sagacity in recently meeting with a Niger Delta warlord and finding a peaceful way to calm frayed nerves.” Akar added that the government can guarantee national security through quality education. “Everyone knows there is a synergy between quality education and security because though national security is the first duty of every government, education is its foundation. Akpabio clearly knows how to tackle these head on and resolve them very quickly,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
