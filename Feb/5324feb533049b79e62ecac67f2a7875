Terrorists have invaded Damba Housing Estate, Gusau in Zamfara State last night where they abducted the wife and two children of a Director of Finance in the Zamfara State Ministry of Finance, Sirajo Hassan. The terrorists entered the director’s house around 1am on Monday in an attempt to kidnap him but he was not at home. When they realised that the Director was not in the house, they abducted his wife Maryam Gambo and her two little children. Gunshots were heard as the vigilantes engaged the terrorists in a gun battle in a bid to avert the kidnap but were overpowered by the terrorists. Two of the vigilante sustained injuries as a result of the gunshots and were rushed to the hospital for treatment. Residents of the area have been in fear due to persistent terrorists attacks, calling on the security agents to come to their aid. The area – an outskirts of Gusau town, the state capital, was attacked three times by the terrorists in the last one month where nine people have so far been kidnapped. The state police command under CP Ayuba Elkana has visited the area last week where he promised to send security personnel to the area, but up till now, nothing was done. Copyright PUNCH.
