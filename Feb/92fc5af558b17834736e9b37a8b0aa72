No fewer than five persons were reportedly killed on Monday in Bayelsa State during a clash involving suspected members of the Iceland and Bobos rival groups. The incident happened at the Amarata area of the state capital, Yenagoa. A suspected drug peddler was said to be among victims of the cult war. It was gathered that the killing of the unidentified drug peddler sparked the clash at about 3am on Monday. The Iceland boys, who are believed to be controlling the area, were said to have launched an offensive after they received report of his killing. A source claimed that the drug peddler had earlier had an altercation with some unknown persons at a popular bar during a birthday party. He was said to have been trailed to his house and shot twice before he was attacked with machete. “We heard two shots fired at about 3am, and we heard voices shouting,” the source claimed. Angered by the shooting, the Iceland group stormed the base of the Bobos group and shot dead one of their members. They also dispossessed residents of mobile phones and other valuables at gunpoint. The spokesman for the Bayelsa State Police Command, Asinim Butswat, confirmed the renewed cult clash in Yenagoa. He, however, said that only one casualty was recorded in the incident, adding that the police had commenced investigation.  All rights reserved.
