Four personnel of the Nigerian Air Force on Thursday allegedly brutalised security men at the Mab Global Estate at the Gwanripa area of the Federal Capital Territory. Our correspondent gathered that a tenant in the estate who felt infuriated for being subjected to a check invited the airmen to beat up the security men. A resident of the estate who simply gave his name as Austin said the airmen were invited by a tenant in the estate came late and did not want to be checked. He said, “It was a tenant who came in very late at night. It was around 1am. The security men stopped him for a check but he refused and engaged them in an argument and the next thing he said was that they would hear from him. “He called the NAF personnel, they came and engaged the security personnel comprising policemen and civil security personnel at the estate’s gate. The airmen beat them up.” When contacted, the President of the Estate, Armed Ihedioha confirmed the incident. The FCT Spokesperson, Josephine Adeh, said she does not have information on the incident. She said, “I don’t have any information on what you have contacted me on.” Calls to the Spokesperson, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, did not go through. He has yet to respond to a message sent to him as of press time. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
