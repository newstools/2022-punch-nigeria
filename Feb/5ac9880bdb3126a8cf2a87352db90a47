In response to a troll who accused her of ignoring a plea for help during the Covid-19 pandemic, actress, Omoni Oboli, has emphatically stated that only her three kids are entitled to her money. The troll, while appealing for financial assistance from the actress, said her husband lost his job during the Covid-19 pandemic, adding that their son was sick. An account number was attached to the post made by the yet-to-be-identified woman. However, after getting no credit alert from Oboli, the woman trolled the actress for ignoring her plea for help. The post read, “Happy Sunday omoni, well I tot I shuld let u knw dt u tot me not to depend on anyone, I waited for ur alert all day thinking u will remember me, well God smiled on our face, we have good jobs now thanks for ignoring.” Reacting on Instagram, Oboli lamented entitlement by help seekers, adding that she spent millions of naira doing giveaways during the hardship occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic. She added, “It’s the entitlement that kills me! Like seriously! Do you know how hard I work! I’m up when your ass is in bed! WORKING! I don’t sleep as many hours as most people because my bills won’t pay themselves and my goals and dreams are bigger than most people! “So I grind! Constantly working on several businesses including my day job which is Film! Right now, I’m in pre-production for 2 jobs! About to shoot one in a couple of weeks while running my other businesses and being a full-time wife and mother with no help! “Went to bed at 4.30am cos I was doing bulk cooking for my family! So, nobody is entitled to my money except my kids and last I checked, I have just 3.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
