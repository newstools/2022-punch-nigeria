The management of the Osun State Polytechnic, Iree, has called on the students and staff of the institution to comply with the dusk to dawn curfew imposed by the Iree community to check rising insecurity in the town. An internal memo signed by J. Fadeji on behalf of the Registrar of the Polytechnic, obtained on Wednesday, indicates that the Aree-in-Council working with security agencies had declared restriction of movement from 10pm to 6am daily to check activities of ritualists and armed robbers. The institution, in its directive to the students and staff living within the community, subsequently advised them to comply with the restriction, and stay indoors during the period of the curfew. The memo titled ‘Dusk to dawn curfew in Iree town’ read in part, “The Aree-in-Council, in conjunction with the various security organs in town, has declared a dusk to dawn curfew in Iree town. “The curfew, which will be effective between the hours of 10.00 p.m and 6.00 a.m., is put in place to stem the tide of ritual killings, armed robberies, kidnappings and other forms of insecurity prevalent in the town. “In view of the foregoing, all members of staff and students resident in Iree town are strongly advised to comply with the directive of the Aree in Council and the security agencies in respect of the curfew and stay in their respective houses during the hours declared for the curfew. “You are required to abide by this directive in your own interest.” Copyright PUNCH.
