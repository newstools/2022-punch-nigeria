The Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria has assured the Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers of its support to raise awareness of compulsory insurance and to boost insurance penetration in the country. The President of CIIN, Dr Muftau Oyegungle, gave the assurance during a courtesy visit of the NCRIB council to the institute recently, according to a statement. The President, NCRIB, Mr Rotimi Edu, said the reason for the council’s visit was to pay homage and seek the support of the institute in driving his thrust of office. According to him, the thrust includes promoting compliance with compulsory insurances; elevating the quality of professionalism in insurance broking, and boosting insurance adoption. While congratulating Oyegungle on his recent doctorate degree in insurance, Edu commended the leadership role of CIIN in the industry, especially on the establishment of the College of Insurance and Financial Management. He said that partnering with the institute would greatly help accelerate insurance awareness through improved education, sensitisation programmes and trainings across the country. In his response, Oyegunle congratulated Edu as the 21st president of NCRIB and expressed optimism in his capacity to deliver effectively. “I thank the NCRIB council for this visit; we are happy to host you and you can rest assured of our support and partnership to grow the industry.
