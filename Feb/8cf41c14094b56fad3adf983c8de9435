A governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Grand Alliance in Enugu State, Dr Jeff Nnamani, has called on the National Assembly to consider an amendment to the electoral law to allow the Independent National Electoral Commission take over the conduct of elections into the 774 local government areas in the country from the state independent electoral commissions. Nnamani, in a statement on Saturday, said this was the only way to stem the ugly tide of arrested development in most states, deepen democracy and boost the confidence of the masses in democracy as truly a government of the people by the people and for the people. He said, “The total apathy witnessed in grassroots elections is as a result of having states conduct local government elections. “I have confidence in INEC as a body that can conduct credible grassroots elections as seen with the elections conducted by the body in the past in Rivers, Anambra and Edo states, where the opposition triumphed over the ruling parties.” Nnamani also hailed APGA’s polling agents and members in Enugu State for remaining steadfast and principled, saying their efforts would be rewarded in the 2023 elections. He said APGA had shown that it could stand for and with the people of the state by serving as a reliable and impeccable platform to promote grassroots development. Copyright PUNCH.
