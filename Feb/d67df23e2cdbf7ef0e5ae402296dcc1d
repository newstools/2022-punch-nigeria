APM Terminals Apapa says 175 employees have graduated as lean practitioners since the start of th company’s Lean Academy in 2019. Lean thinking is a transformational framework that provides a new way to organising human activities to deliver more benefits to society and value to individuals while eliminating waste. The company said in a statement that “Apapa’s lean practitioners are expected to take the lead in introducing innovative solutions to terminal operations with the goal of improving efficiency and customer service.” According to the statement, APM Terminals Apapa is transformed by re-tooling and re-educating employees to eliminate waste, boost productivity and promote innovation every day. The Project Manager, Way of Working, Martin Kjeldsen, said, “Our employees play a central role in our transformation. They are the ones who will make Apapa a great place to work through involvement and engagement within our Way of Working, through high level of Lean education, a Lean mindset and Kaizens – for immediate, real results and long-term sustainable impact. “Practicing Lean requires a changed mindset from running the business to improving the business, helping us preventing fire-fighting in our day-to-day job. It’s not easy, but it is manageable if we set our minds to it. If we invest heavily in WoW and celebrate our successes.” According to the statement, a major milestone in the terminal’s lean journey is the introduction of practical WoW coaches. “This is a dedicated stand-alone role with the objective of strengthening APM Terminals Apapa’s lean capabilities and knowledge of WoW tools,” it said.
