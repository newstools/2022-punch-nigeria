The Lagos State Government has partnered with the United States Consulate to boost the technology skills of students in the state. The Commissioner for Education, Mrs Folasade Adefisayo, said this in a statement on Tuesday. Adefisayo was quoted to have said this at the Science Technology Engineering Arts and Mathematics Lagos drone training initiative and football grand finale held in Agege. She said, “This programme is part of government’s strategy for promoting STEM education and it will greatly impact the learning of our students and spur their interest in technology. “I want to encourage the students to maximise the opportunities inherent in the programme as it will influence their future positively. “I also appreciate the US Consulate for partnering with the government to engage the students and training them in drone technology, as this will nurture and unleash their potential, arouse their creativity, critical thinking, foster a teamwork spirit and aid their communication.” The Head of Public Affairs, US Consulate, Mr Stephen Ibelli, commended the state government for the partnership and expressed the possibility of long-term training benefits for the students.
