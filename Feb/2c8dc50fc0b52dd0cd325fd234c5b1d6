Google has announced the expansion of its two-step verification process for log-ins to enhance account security. The company said its newly introduced two-step verification initiative brought about a 50 per cent drop in account breaches for 150 million Gmail and two million YouTube creator accounts under the 2SV initiative. According to the firm, the 2SV allows the use of mobile phones to confirm a user’s identity every time they access their Google Account from a different device. In a statement, the Government Affairs and Public Policy Manager, Nigeria, Dawn Dimowo, said, “We don’t just plug security holes, we work to eliminate entire classes of threats for people who depend on our services. “Today alone, billions of people around the world will use our products to help with things big and small from conducting e-payment transactions or teaching an online class full of students. It is our responsibility to keep users’ personal information safe and secure.” The company said in 2021, it increased its effort to eliminate password threats by starting to auto-enrol users in 2SV, providing people with an additional layer of security when cyber criminals attempt to hack into their accounts. According to it, through its initiative, more than 1.5 billion security checks were done. “This decrease speaks volumes to how having a second form of verification can be effective in protecting your data and personal information.”
