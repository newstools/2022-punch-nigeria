Nigerians made 1,350 calls to report data breaches in 2021, a report by the National Information Technology Development Agency has shown. The report is the Nigerian Data Protection Regulation Performance Report 2020-2021. According to data from the report, the number of phone calls made by Nigerians to report data breaches increased from 1,230 to 1,350. It was also disclosed that NITDA issued 105 compliance and enforcement notices in 2021, which was lower than the 230 notices issues in 2020. Despite this, the number of compliances issues resolved rose from 790 in 2020 to 2080 in 2021. In his remark in the report, NIDTA DG, Kashifu Abdullahi, stressed the need for the country to address issues around the global data industry. He said, “Nigeria as a country with immense opportunities and challenges has made conscious efforts to develop pragmatic solutions to the cross-cutting issues in the global data industry. “We as a nation cannot afford to be a pariah in the comity of progressive nations; we also cannot afford to be a dumping ground for every other nation. Our citizens are global, our diaspora is diverse and productive, hence our policies and strategies must be agile, practical and scalable. This is what we are striving to do with the NDPR.” The PUNCH had earlier reported that NITDA engaged in 17 data breach investigations and issued N15m fines in 2021. It was also disclosed that the number of ongoing investigations on alleged data breaches rose from 15 in 2020 to 17 in 2021, while the number of investigations concluded rose from one in 2020 to seven in 2021. In addition, the amount of fines issued rose from N1m in 2020 to 15m in 2021. In another report, it was disclosed that 1,213 firms have complied with the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation.
