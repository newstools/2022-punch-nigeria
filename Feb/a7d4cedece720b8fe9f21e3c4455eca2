2023 presidential hopeful, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, has condemned the recent killing of traders at the New Cattle Market in Omuma-Uzo, Ukwa West Local Government Area of Abia State where eight persons lost their lives. In a strongly-worded statement of condemnation, Anyim described the attack and killing of the traders as barbaric and condemnable. He lamented that the evil murderers were trying to stage one section of Nigerian against the other by taking the lives of defenceless and innocent citizens pursuing their legitimate businesses. The statement which he personally signed read, “The unfortunate incident at the New Cattle Market in Omuma-Uzo, Ukwa West Local Government Area of Abia State where hoodlums attacked and killed eight traders is despicable, barbaric, and condemnable. “These evil men spilling precious human blood and trying to set one group against another must be stopped at all cost. “The insecurity In the South East and the country at large should be a matter of serious concern to every well-meaning Nigerian,” he cautioned. Anyim, who is contesting the presidency of Nigeria on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, however, commended “the government of Abia State for condemning the dastardly act in strong terms and promising to take steps to bring the perpetrators to justice. “I urge Abia State government to expedite actions to fish out the perpetrators as that will demonstrate to the whole world that the people of Abia State and indeed the entire Ndigbo of the South-East geopolitical Zone are lovers and protectors of their neighbors and visitors alike. “I condole with those whose beloved ones died in the attack and pray that the Almighty God grants eternal rest to the souls of the departed.”
