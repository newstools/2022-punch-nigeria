Super Eagles head coach Austin Eguavoen and his assistant Emmanuel Amuneke will be at Selhurst Park to watch Crystal Palace take on Chelsea in a Premier League game on Saturday, PUNCH Sports Extra has reliably learnt. The coaches were at the King Power stadium on Thursday to watch the trio Wilfred Ndidi, Kelechi Iheanacho and Ademola Lookman feature for Leicester City who defeated Randers FC 4-1 in their Europa Conference League clash. They are expected to meet with Palace stars Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze as they bid to convince the pair to switch their nationality from England to Nigeria, our correspondent also gathered. Both players are eligible to play for Nigeria. Olise was born in England to a Nigerian father and a French-Algerian mother, making him eligible to represent any of the four countries while Eze born in England as well to Nigerian parents. He has represented the England U-21 level but through his parents, the 23-year-old also remains eligible to represent the Eagles. “There is a meeting scheduled for the coaches to meet Eze and Olise this weekend,” a source told PUNCH Sports Extra on condition of anonymity. “We are hopeful that Eze and Olise will be well convinced by the coaches of what plans they have for them.” There are also plans to meet with Southampton’s Nathan Tella, Reading’s Ovie Ejaria and Fulham’s Tosin Adarabioyo before the coaches return to Nigeria to finalise their squad list for next month’s crucial Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifying play-off against Ghana. Nigeria, who have featured in six of the past seven World Cups, will face the Black Stars in Cape Coast on March 24, before both teams clash again at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja three days later.
