Broadcaster and singer, Rotimi Martins, aka Alariwo of Africa, has advised young artistes to invest themselves. He told Sunday Scoop, “Investment is very important. Invest in yourself (young artistes), and also invest in your family. Whatever plan you have, don’t let anyone know till it has been executed. You should also invest in properties because fame will come and go.” Alariwo also urged people to pay more attention to songs that had positive messages. He said, “The music industry has evolved. It is becoming intriguing and exciting. I respect the creativity and talent of these young artistes, but most of them don’t write good songs. (But) when we tell them to be more creative, they feel it is disrespecting and insulting. I love what they are doing. However, people should listen to songs with messages, not just the melody. Most people dance to the beats and not listen to the message. Entertainers are meant to inform and entertain. Music is very spiritual and deep for me. If I am given an instrumental, to the glory of God, I will write a song within five minutes. And, if it is too difficult, I would finish the song in two days.” Shedding light on what he has been working on, he said, “I am still a broadcaster. I also anchor events. Right now, I am in the studio and I’m about to put out a single. I have a list of young artistes I will love to work with.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
