A 28-year-old man, Abdullahi Adamu, has allegedly raped a five-year-old nursery three pupil in Adamawa State. The suspect was alleged to have lured the minor into an uncompleted building in Mubi, in the Mubi North Local Government Area of the state, where he had carnal knowledge of her. The five-year old minor attends a school at Anguwan Madina, near Adamu’s residence in Mubi town. Adamu was alleged to have lured the child with a N20 biscuit while she was returning from school alone. “I asked her to come with me to a nearby shop to pick a biscuit and she obliged me, after which I took her into an uncompleted building,” Adamu allegedly said in his confessional statement. A neighbour, who sighted him leaving the building with the minor, reportedly alerted other residents, leading to his arrest. PUNCH Metro gathered that medical examinations at the General Hospital, Mubi, established that Adamu raped the child. The suspect was subsequently arraigned before Magistrate Hamidu Aminu of the Chief Magistrate’s Court II, Mubi. Adamu, who had earlier confessed to the crime, pleaded guilty to the charge. The magistrate ordered the police prosecutor, Inspector Theman John, to duplicate the case file and transmit same to the Directorate of Public Prosecutions for advice. Aminu ordered that the defendant be remanded in custody.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
