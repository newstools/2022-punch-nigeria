No fewer than seven people were killed on Tuesday night following terrorists attack in three communities of the Zango Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State. The PUNCH gathered that the terrorists in a well-coordinated attack burnt more than half of the houses and one person was also burnt in Zaman Dabo, while the remaining six people were killed in Chibob and Sabon Kaura. According to an eyewitness, the terrorists came in large number, shooting sporadically and destroying property worth millions of naira. The terrorists also took advantage of the absence of soldiers in the early hours of today at a checkpoint between Ungwan Wakili and Abuyab to destroy the only bridge that linked the two communities. Our correspondent gathered that soldiers manning the area normally leave the checkpoint in the early hours to patrol the villages to prevent possible attacks. Atyap communities in the Zango Kataf Local Government Area have been under attack since last year, while many property and lives have been lost. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mohammed Jalige, did not respond to calls by our correspondent as of the time of filling this report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
