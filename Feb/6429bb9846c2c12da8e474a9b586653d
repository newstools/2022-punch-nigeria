Following the inability of Muazu Magaji, a critic of Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, to meet his bail conditions, his counsel, Garzali Ahmad, has sought their review. It was gathered that counsel filed an application before the Kano State Magistrates’ Court praying it to review the bail conditions to enable Magaji to perfect them. Ahmad filed and signed an application for review dated February 9, 2022, and prayed the court to rescind the earlier bail conditions for his client. Senior Magistrate Aminu Gabari admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N1m with two reliable sureties, one of who must be the village head of Dansarauniya, and either the Hisbah Commander or the Chief Imam of the Dawakin Tofa Local Government Area of the state. The court also ordered Magaji to deposit his passport at the registry. It was gathered that the defendant had yet to meet the conditions as neither the Hisbah Commander nor the Chief Imam of Dawakin Tofa showed up to sign the bail bond for him. The defendant is standing trial for alleged defamation of character, intentional insult, injurious falsehood, and inciting disturbance. Magaji, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The prosecution counsel, Wada A. Wada, who is the Principal State Counsel in the Kano State Ministry of Justice, told the court that the defendant committed the offence between 2021 and 2022 on his Facebook page. Wada alleged that Magaji posted a picture of Ganduje with a yet-to-be-identified woman allegedly engaging in an immoral or extramarital affair on his Facebook page. According to him, the offence contravenes sections 392, 399 and 114 of the Penal Code. The case has been adjourned till March 2, 2022, for further mention. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
