Gombe State Governor Muhammadu  Yahaya has approved the appointment of  Olanre Daniel as Chairman, Gombe State Sports Commission, with immediate effect. The Secretary to the State Government, Prof Ibrahim  Njodi, who announced the Governor’s approval, said the decision was sequel to the resignation of the erstwhile chairman of the commission, Hamza Soye. Soye, in a letter addressed to the Governor on Tuesday, through the SSG, tendered his resignation. Sources claimed Soye’s decision to resign from his position was not unconnected with the differences between him and the management of Gombe United FC, especially over the running of the club’s affairs. However, the statement said government was behind the management of Gombe United, “who are living up to expectations by not only getting the club elevated to the top league in the country, the Nigeria Professional Football League, but also making the state proud with their remarkable performance. “Government is pleased that the current management of the top NPFL club has repositioned the team within a short period, making it one of the clubs to beat in the country’s topflight league.” Soye, however, declined comments on why he resigned, saying it was too early to speak on the issue. “I will speak but not now; they said it’s due to irreconcilable differences but later I will speak. It’s too early,” the former chairman said.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
