Despite defeat to Premier League champions, Manchester City, on Saturday, Nigeria international Alex Iwobi was treated to a standing ovation by Everton fans following his impressive display against Pep Guardiola’s side, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The Foxes were unlucky in Saturday’s Premier League clash against City as Phil Foden’s 82nd-minute strike condemned them to a 1-0 defeat at Goodison Park. Frank Lampard’s men were the better side as they created a lot of goal scoring chances in the first half and limited the league leaders to few opportunities. Iwobi, who has been impressive since Lampard’s appointment in January, was named in the starting XI for the third successive match and he produced another encouraging display, creating the best chance of the first 45 minutes. The Nigerian’s efforts were saluted by the Goodison faithful when he was replaced by Anwar El Ghazi in the 88th minute, much to the delight of the forward. “I’m happy with my performance and grateful for the reception I got from fans when I went off, but we wanted the result our performance deserved,” Iwobi told evertontv. “We can be pleased with how we played, though.” He added, “The manager has given everyone the confidence that we are a really good team, can be very good on the ball. He just wants us to trust our ability. It’s not just me, we are all thriving off him and enjoying it. “Personally, the manager’s support gives me the belief that I can go out and express myself and enjoy the games. It really helps me to show what I’ve got. It works for me and it works for the team. Long may that continue.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
