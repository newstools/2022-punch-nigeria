THE Gombe State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has described its members who decamped to the Peoples Democratic Party as selfish, adding that they are undemocratic elements. A former deputy governor of the state, John Yoriyo, was one of the early set of defectors, followed by governorship aspirants Jubrin Barde, Jamilu Ishyaku and many others. Briefing journalists in Gombe on the turn of the event, the APC Publicity Secretary, Moses Kyari said the defectors did not contribute to the growth of the party, describing them as mere sympathisers who sought for shade under the broom. According to him, “What has been playing out is a circus show remotely been directed by certain individuals to shore up the image of the opposition. They are bringing the malicious intentions of the perpetrators and actors as well. “Barde, Ishyaku and hon. Rambi Ayala were on-lookers and passive members in the first place hence, their resignation from an organisation of which they were passive members does not hold water. “Jubrin Barde, as soon as he lost the APC primary in 2019, detached himself from our campaign, he never attended any party function. He never contributed to the party’s successes.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
