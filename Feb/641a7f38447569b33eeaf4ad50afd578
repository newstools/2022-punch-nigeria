The Chairman of the Electoral Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party, Lagos State chapter, Duoye Diri, has called on officials to seek party interests above personal ambitions. Diri, who is also the Governor of Bayelsa State, made this call on Sunday during the PDP state congress held in Ikeja GRA, Lagos. He said, “All we want is unity in the Lagos State chapter, and if you do not want unity, then you are not a PDP member. After this congress, PDP will not be divided again and I want to appeal to those who are contesting to see the interest of the party first, far and above their personal ambitions, so that the party will come out stronger in this congress.” Diri added that the party would encourage consensus arrangements for the offices being contested. “We try to encourage some form of consensus arrangement, in as much we are also ready to open the space for people to exercise their right, which is also what is going on. The delegates will determine who becomes their chairman and every other office. I would have loved a situation where the leaders will come together and agree on a form of consensus “Therefore, we would like all of us who have been accredited as delegates to listen to your leaders and elders and do the needful and vote on who they have already agreed on. In case you do not believe in that, you are equally free to express your franchise. We are in a democracy and we are not forcing it down on anybody,” he added. The Lagos PDP chairmanship contestants are Philips Aivoji, Niyi Adams, Hakeem Amode, and Dr Amos Fawole. As of the time of filing this report, delegates from various Local Government Areas were casting their votes. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
