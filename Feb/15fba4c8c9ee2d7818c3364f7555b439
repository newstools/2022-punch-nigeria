About 25 ISWAP fighters fleeing airstrikes of the Nigerian military have drowned in Lake Chad river around Marte axis of the Lake Chad, a known stronghold of the terrorists in Borno State, North-East. PRNigeria reports that military fighter jets, including Super Tucano belonging to the Nigerian Air Force raided camps of the Islamic State of West African Province in a weeklong sustained aerial attack leading to the death of scores of the terrorists. An intelligence operative living in the local community confirmed that camps and warehouses serving as ISWAP insurgents’ ammunition and firearms stores were bombed and destroyed by the aircraft. “The military jets’ bombardments were simultaneously carried out at Bukar Mairam and Jubularam, Abbaganaram and Chikul Gudu which resulted in the explosion of the warehouses, killing several terrorists. “The terrorists who survived the blast at Bukar Mairam and Jubularam fled and attempted to cross a river within the Lake Chad axis. It was in the process that about 25 of them got drowned,” the local source added. He further said that recent air offensives by troops have seriously affected ISWAP operational command, thwarting the group’s plans to carry out major attacks on military formations in the Northeast.
