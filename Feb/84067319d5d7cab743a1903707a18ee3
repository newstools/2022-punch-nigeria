The author of the book, ‘I am a Nigerian In Music’ and ‘I am a Nigerian In Literary,’ Foluke Oyeleye, has celebrated the strides of Nigerians in education, music, science, business, and other sectors. The two books, according to a statement on Thursday were part of the collection in the Oyeleye’s Tani series which showcases the dedication, passion, and achievement of notable Nigerians to inspire generations of Nigerian children and expand their ideas of what and who they can be. The books, according to the statement, contained additional information about places, history, and other things relating to Nigerian culture. The author said, “The seed for Tani Series was sown in my heart while I was a student at Harvard Business School. Researching and writing about Chief Timothy Odutola and his impact on the Nigerian manufacturing sector for one of my projects made me realise that I could tell the stories I want the world to read. “I began researching and writing about the many amazing Nigerians who have contributed to making this world a better place. As I worked on the series, I discovered more strides made by each of these amazing people than I had previously known or imagined and I wanted to tell their stories in a rich and creative way.” Copyright PUNCH.
