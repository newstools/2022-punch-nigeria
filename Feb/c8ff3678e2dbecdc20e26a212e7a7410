A magistrates’ court sitting in Akure, the Ondo State capital, has remanded pastor, Sarah Abuloye, in a correctional centre over the death of a member of the church. The 49-year-old defendant, who is the founder of a church in Igbara-Oke, the headquarters of the Ifedore Local Government Area of the state, was arrested for alleged involvement in the death of the member, one Adefunle Aselogbon. The prosecutor, Obalasa Ajiboye, informed the court that the defendant allegedly killed Aselogbon and dumped her remains in a bush behind her church on January 6, 2022. The charge sheet read, “That you, Serah Abuloye, did conspire to commit felony, to wit: murder, thereby committing an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 324 of the Criminal Code, Cap. 37, Vol. 1, Laws of Ondo State of Nigeria, 2006. “That you, Serah Abuloye  and others at large on the same date, time and place in the aforementioned magisterial district, did kill and dump one Adefunke Aselogbon, aged 37, in a bush at the back of your church, thereby committing an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 319(1) of the Criminal Code, Cap. 37, Vol. 1, Laws of Ondo State of Nigeria, 2006.” The prosecutor urged the court to remand the defendant in prison pending the outcome of advice from the state’s Director of Public Prosecutions. He also said the body of the deceased had been deposited at the mortuary. Counsel for the defendant, Mrs Ola Adedire, did not oppose the prosecutor’s application. In his ruling, the presiding magistrate, Damilola Sekoni, ordered that the defendant be remanded in police custody and adjourned the case till February 18, 2022 for ruling on remand application.
