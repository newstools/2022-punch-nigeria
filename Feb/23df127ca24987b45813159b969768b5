The management of the Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University, Igbariam, Anambra State, has informed parents and the general public that the institution is not part of the ongoing nationwide strike declared by the Academic Staff Union of Universities. The management advised parents to take note, in case their wards studying at the institution want to misinform them on the development. This was contained in a statement signed by the school’s Public Relations Officer, Dr Harrison Madubueze, in Awka, on Wednesday. The statement read, “This is to inform the general public that Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University is not on strike. “Academic activities are going on massively with the University-wide quiz which began on Tuesday, February 22, 2022, and will end on Saturday, February 26, 2022. “Parents should therefore ignore any of their wards who come home to inform them otherwise. “The University is committed to ensuring that students graduate when they are supposed to without incurring further expenses for their parents.” Copyright PUNCH.
