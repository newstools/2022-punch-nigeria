The Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Thursday, said he remained the aspirant to beat during the All Progressives Congress governorship primary slated for February 19 in the state. He spoke shortly after he appeared before the APC Screening Committee at the party’s National Secretariat, Abuja, as part of steps leading to the conduct of the State governorship primary election. This was contained in a statement shared on the State Government Facebook’s page titled, ‘I remain the aspirant to beat – Oyetola’. Oyetola, who was accompanied to the party secretariat by party leaders, supporters, and loyalists, including cabinet members, said his performance in the last three years put him ahead of other aspirants. “Recently, I began a strategic consultation with the party members to seek their support ahead of the primary election. And the reception has been very encouraging. So far, we have visited 18 councils. “I don’t want to talk about individuals. But I believe that I remain the aspirant to beat,” Oyetola added. The former Osun Secretary to State Government, Moshood Adeoti, was also at the party secretariat for screening. It would be recalled that the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, had last Monday charged the people of the town to vote for the incumbent governor irrespective of any consideration. Adeoti hails from Iwo. Oluwo, who advised his subjects not to waste their resources and energy working against the re-election bid of the governor, said only those who were not interested in the growth and development of the town in particular and Osun State, in general, would want to run against Oyetola.
