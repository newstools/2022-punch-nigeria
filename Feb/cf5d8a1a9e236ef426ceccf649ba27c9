The Alawe of Ilawe Ekiti, Oba Adebanji Alabi, on Wednesday lauded the Senate for approving the establishment of a campus of the Nigerian Law School meant for the South West geo political zone in his community. Alabi expressed the readiness “to provide land and other wherewithal to make the town conducive for the campus.” The traditional ruler, in a statement by his media adviser, Chief Ajibade Olubunmi, titled, ‘Alawe commends senators for approving Ilawe as the site of law school campus,’ urged members of the public “to disregard the earlier fake news that the campus was for another town.” He said, “I appeared before the Senate Committee on Legal Education in Abuja in November 2021 and spoke on behalf of the traditional rulers of the towns in the six geo-political zones where the six proposed law schools would be sited. “I thank the Senate led by Senator Ahmad Lawan and the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Legal Education headed by Senator Opeyemi Bamidele and as well the sponsor of the motion, Senator Smart Adeyemi.” “I thank members of the public for their support. The erroneous impression by a few sections of the press was corrected at a press briefing in Abuja on Tuesday evening by the sponsor of the motion, Senator Adeyemi, with a confirmation that Ilawe Ekiti would host the Law School campus for the South West geo political zone of Nigeria.”  Copyright PUNCH.
