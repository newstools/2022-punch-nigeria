An Osun State High Court, sitting in Ile-Ife, on Wednesday, refused to set aside his November 22, 2021 judgement which affirmed Soji Adagunodo, as the chairman of Peoples Democratic Party in Osun state. The court in his judgement had held that the preservative order of an Ikirun High Court which declared Adagunodo as the chairman of the party was not appealed against, thus still subsists. But the national leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party had approached the court with an application, asking that the court set aside its decision. But while ruling on the application on Wednesday, Justice A. Aderibigbe declined the application and refused to set aside its ruling. Reacting to the decision of the court, Edmund Biriomoni, who represented Adagunodo in the matter said, the implication of the verdict is that the appointment of Wale Ojo, who was appointed acting chairman after Adagunodo had been elected South-West PDP chairman, was valid. But counsel for the PDP, Hashim Abioye said his client would appeal the judgement, saying the decision of the court would not affect ward Congress of the party slated for Thursday. Copyright PUNCH.
