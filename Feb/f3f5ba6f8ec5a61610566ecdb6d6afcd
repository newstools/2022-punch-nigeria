The Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, says the Federal Government will deploy atomic materials to boost energy supply across the country. The minister said this at the validation workshop of the draft revised national energy policy and its related master plan in Abuja, according to a press statement issued by the ministry on Monday. The statement read in part, “The Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu has said that Nigeria will join other countries of the world to exploit atomic materials for more energy supply. “Dr. Onu said Nigeria is watching with keen interest the research ongoing in many countries on nuclear fusion technology for energy use.” The minister said that a national energy policy and master plan are imperative to guide energy development in the country. He was quoted as saying, “While the National Energy Policy provided policies for long-term coordinated energy development for our energy security in an environmentally sustainable manner and with active participation of the private sector, the energy master plan provides the roadmap for achieving the policy objectives through activities and programmes with timelines.” Copyright PUNCH.
