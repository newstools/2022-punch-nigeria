An interdenominational outreach under the auspices of Reach4Christ recently visited correctional centres in Delta State where they preached the gospel and donated food items to the prisoners. Ahead of the 80th birthday celebration of the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the team had embarked on an 80-day soul-winning global challenge. The visitation team stormed correctional centres in Ogwashi Uku and Sapele, where cakes to mark Adeboye’s birthday were given to the prisoners. The Reach4Christ team members who were warmly received by the prison authorities preached to the prisoners and donated items to them. See photos of visits below:  Reach4Christ, which is an interdenominational platform, is on a mission to win 8,000,000 souls to Christ through higher institutions invasion, prison visitation, secondary School outreaches, mission fields, global outreaches, mega city crusades, and other platforms.
