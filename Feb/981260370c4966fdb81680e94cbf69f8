Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business  has extended the accreditation of all business degree programmes of Lagos Business School. A statement by the LBS stated that the reaccreditation, which was valid for five years, reaffirmed LBS premier status as being the only business school in Nigeria and one of eight in Africa to be accredited by AACSB. The Executive Vice-President, and Chief Accreditation Officer of AACSB, Stephanie Bryant, said; AACSB has for more than a century been synonymous with the highest standards in business education. “Every AACSB accredited school has demonstrated a focus on excellence in all areas, including teaching, research, curricula development, and student learning. The intense peer-review process exemplifies their commitment to quality business education.” “It is a global non-profit association for the business education industry providing quality assurance, business education intelligence, and learning and development services to over 1,700 member organisations and more than 840 accredited business schools worldwide. It is the largest global business education network, linking students, academia, and businesses to advance the cause of business education around the world.” Commenting on the milestone, the Dean of LBS, Prof Chris Ogechie stated that with the AACSB re-accreditation, LBS had once more distinguished itself as a management education provider of high repute in Africa. “The reaccreditation is an external validation of our excellent quality; our goal through our MBA programmes, and other executive programmes to develop responsible leaders who are solving Africa’s social and institutional business problems.” Copyright PUNCH.
