Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has commiserated with the family of late DSP Abdulkadir Rano, the Divisional Police Officer of Jibia in Katsina State, and the Rano Emirate over his death. Rano was killed by bandits in the line of duty in Katsina State. The governor’s message is contained in a statement issued by Abba Anwar, the Chief Press Secretary to Ganduje. The statement read in part, “The information about his death was sad. And he passed away when Nigeria needed him the most. He was one of the highly disciplined officers in the service of the Nigeria Police Force. “We really lost a patriotic and gallant officer, whose patriotic posture added value to the service he left. His doggedness and unparalleled commitment to duty were outstanding and commendable.” Ganduje described Rano as one of the finest police officers, whose efforts in securing lives and properties could not be measured. While commiserating with the family of the late DPO, the governor said Nigeria had lost an honest police officer. “On behalf of the government and good people of Kano State, I am sending our condolences to his family, the Nigeria Police Force and the Rano Emirate. May Allah forgive all his shortcomings and reward his good deeds,” he added.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
