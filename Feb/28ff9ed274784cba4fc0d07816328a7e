A 42-year-old man, Nurudeen Yisau, has solicited support from well-meaning Nigerians in order to undergo a kidney transplant. His wife, Bukola, in a letter to The Punch, said Yisau was diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease eight months ago. “He has been on dialysis twice a week at a private hospital in Shagamu, Ogun State. Due to the advanced stage of the kidney which has gotten to end-stage, the Nephrologist at the hospital advised him to go for a transplant in order for him to live again and to proffer a lasting cure. “The transplant will cost N15m and we can’t afford that as we have spent so much on his twice-weekly dialysis. Yisau needs all necessary assistance to be able to live long.” A medical report signed by a Consultant Nephrologist, Dr O.O Oyebisi, which was sighted by our correspondent, partly read, “The kidney transplant will provide a cure for the kidney failure. It will improve his survival and quality of life.” Members of the public can make donations into Yisau’s Guarantee Bank’s account, 0232079303, while he can also be reached on his mobile number, 08180287046.
