A political group under the aegis of Rescue Nigeria Mission, has called on the governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, to contest for the President in 2023. Speaking on Saturday in Lafia at a one-day induction and training programme for supporters of Yahaya Bello,  the North-Central Coordinator of the group, Tauhid Haruna, explained that members of the group converged from the six states and the Federal Capital Territory to call on the Kogi governor to run for the 2023 presidency because of his leadership qualities. Haruna said the group, which comprised youths and women, decided that it was time for a youthful and energetic president to emerge in 2023 in order to tackle the numerous problems confronting the nation. He further said since Bello was elected governor, he has delivered the dividends of democracy to Kogi residents, especially in the area of human capital development ‘’which was why a lot of Nigerians are urging him to contest for the 2023 presidency.’’ He said, “We are calling on Governor Bello to run for the office of President because at this stage of Nigeria’s existence, we need a youthful leader who is vibrant and has the strength and capacity to take us out of the present situation that we find ourselves in. “We have mobilized thousands of youths across the North-Central zone and we are making efforts to get more people to join us because we believe that Yahaya Bello is the solution to the problems of Nigeria”.
