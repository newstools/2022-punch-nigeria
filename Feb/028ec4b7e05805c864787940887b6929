Members of the National Executive Council of the  Alumni Association, Adeyemi College of Education, ( now Adeyemi University of Education) Ondo State, has appealed to the Federal Government to appoint a member of the association as a substantive Vice-Chancellor of the institution. A member of the House of Representative for Ondo East/Ondo West Federal Constituency, Mr Abiola Makinde, has earlier announced the upgrade of the institution to a university status, saying the bill on the upgrade had been accented to by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari ( retd.). To this end, alumni of the institution appealed for a member to be the substantive VC of the school. This was contained in a communique issued at the end of the association’s NEC meeting. The communiqué was signed by its National Public Relations Officer and the Acting Secretary, Dr Yemi Olugbamigbe. The communique stated that having an alumnus as a VC of the university “will enable the new university administrator to implement the transition process to a university in a way that will be hitch-free and humanely progressive.” It also read , “The body noted that the pronouncement marks the achievement of the drive to have specialised university in the education sector as operative in some other sectors of our national life and also increase the push for a better quality of education in the country.” The alumni association described the commitment of the federal lawmakers in the eighth and ninth Assembly towards the upgrading of the institution, as monumental.
