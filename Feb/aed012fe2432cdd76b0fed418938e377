Former Nigerian beauty queen and philanthropist, Tracy Solomon, has donated educational materials to the Government Day secondary school, Mayo Dassa, Jalingo, the Taraba state capital. Solomon, who was crowned face of Nigeria in 2021, paid tuition fees for 20 students, and donated branded bags and over 1000 exercise books to other students. The philanthropist also gifted first-aid bags and inaugurated a soccer field in the school, according to Vanguard. During the presentation, she said,”My goal and commitment as a queen and philanthropist is to be able to touch lives positively. “The condition in the country has placed a lot of burden on most families.There are struggles here and there which has led to an increased number of out-of-school students. “We are happy to be able to provide some of these materials for the students”, the serial entrepreneur cum philanthropist, said. “I like to thank Commodore Bushi and my organisation (face of Nigeria Pageant) for this wonderful platform and also my family and everyone who supported me on this project. “Lastly, for everyone present at this occasion and my special invitees, I am overly honoured and grateful to have you all here. “I am also using this opportunity to call on everyone to show more concern to the needs of the disadvantaged amongst us, and I pray that we will all live to see the Nigeria of our dreams.” Copyright PUNCH.
