The National Consultative Front known as the Third Force Movement is expected to form a mega party this week. A spokesperson for the group, Mr. Wale Okunnuyi, said this during a chat with our correspondent on Saturday. Okunnuyi said the group would not be registering a party afresh but would adopt an existing party, change its name and its logo. He said the Independent National Electoral Commission would be informed of the convention of the new party. “We are setting up an alternative mega party next week. We will be fusing into an existing party and we will change the name and the logo. We will adopt a party by next week and we will inform INEC,” he said. When asked if the party would resonate with Nigerians barely a year to the elections, Okunniyi said the timing was appropriate. Some prominent Nigerians in the group include: Prof Pat Utomi, Dr Usman Bugaje, former Governor Rabiu Kwakwanso of Kano State; a former Deputy Governor of the Central bank of Nigeria, Prof Kingsley Moghalu; a former Presidential aspirant, Prof Remi Sonaiya; Pastor Ituah Ighodalo; former INEC Chairman, Prof Attahiru Jega; a former Minister of Education, Dr Oby Ezekwesili; a former President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Dr Olisa Agbakoba (SAN).
