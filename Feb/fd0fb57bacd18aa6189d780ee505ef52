AS the All Progressives Congress prepares for its convention billed for this month, stakeholders across the country have thrown their weight behind the candidacy of Niger State senator, Muhammad Musa, saying he would lead the party to a landslide victory in the 2023 general elections. The Coordinator of the APC Stakeholders, Umar Kumo, stated this in Daura, Katsina State during the turbaning of the Minister of Transport, Chibuike Ameachi as Dan Amanan Daura. He disclosed that mobilisation of delegates and influential party bigwigs were already ongoing to rally supports for the Niger East Senator to emerge as the next elected National Chairman of APC. The unanimous support enjoyed by the Senator, according to Kumo, was not unconnected to “his clean records in public service, persuasive skills and above all, charisma,” which he said were required by the leader of the party to win the hearts of Nigerians ahead of 2023 elections. Kumo added that the party was trying hard to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, particularly the error of taking the sensibilities of Nigerians for granted. He explained further that the stakeholders had agreed “not to fall into the porthole that became the nemesis of the previous party in power.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
