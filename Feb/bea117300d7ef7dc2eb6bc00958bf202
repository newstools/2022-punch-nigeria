Personal Assistant to the President on Digital and New Media, Bashir Ahmad, has disclosed that despite criticism from several quarters, he, alongside other appointees will not be deterred from listing achievements of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). He said while those he described as ‘wailers’, including opposition figures would not desist from faulting the President’s efforts, they would also be at hand to showcase Buhari’s intervention in every sector, particularly his achievements in infrastructural projects. In a post on his Twitter page on Tuesday, the presidential aide noted that it was surprising that people were criticising Buhari despite working on making Nigeria better. He tweeted, “You automatically become angry any time we talk about the successes recorded by this administration especially in the area of agriculture, ICT, or the infrastructure that’s being built now, after abandoning for decades. Your wailing is not going to stop us, as we are going to tell more.” Meanwhile, the presidency always listed Buhari’s achievements under different categories that included security and related matters, economy, anti-graft war among others. It said the achievements include tackling insurgency, decimation of Boko Haram in the North East, recovering of local governments and territories previously under Boko Haram’s control, rebuilding lives of citizens in the region, with over one million displaced persons returning to their communities.
