Former President Goodluck Jonathan has allayed fears that Nigeria would separate after 2023 general elections. He spoke during the Economic Community of West African States’ Council of the WISE strategic retreat and planning workshop held in Lagos on Monday. He noted that previous predictions that Nigeria would disintegrate failed. The former president also expressed optimism that the 2023 elections would be credible. He said, “When elections are coming, there is always this fear that the country will implode. But you see that the country has remained stable,” he said. “When I was in office, (during) the 2015 elections, some people were sending words out of the country, but nothing happened at the end of the day. So 2023 will come and go and this country will remain.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
