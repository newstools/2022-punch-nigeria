A yet-to-be-identified man has been burnt to death in the Ajata Kurudu area of Abuja. He was alleged to have snatched a motorcycle in the community. Our correspondent gathered that the owner of the motorcycle raised the alarm as residents gave him a hot chase. The mob, after catching up with him, set him ablaze in a canal in the area. An eyewitness, who gave his name as Musa, said, “A young man was caught stealing a motorcycle and was burnt alive in Ajata Kurudu. “The owner of the bike cried out for help after he was robbed and some residents went after the suspect. He was caught and beaten to a stupor. They poured petrol on him and set him on fire.” The Federal Capital Territory Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Josephine Adeh, said investigation was ongoing into the incident. She said, “The FCT Police Command frowns on crime and criminality, but self-help in obtaining justice popularly called jungle justice is wrong. It is a crime. We strongly advise people to allow the police to do their job and shun this ugly practice.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
