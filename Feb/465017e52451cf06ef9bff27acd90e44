The Kano State Police Command has arrested five suspects in connection with the murder of a 24-year-old woman, Rukkaya Mustapha, at Danbare town, in the Kumbotso Local Government Area of the state. The victim was murdered on Saturday in her matrimonial home around 7pm while her two children, a three-year-old and a one-and-half-year-old, were beaten to a pulp by the hoodlums. The Deputy Governor of Kano State, Nasiru Gawuna, confirmed the arrest of the suspects when he paid a condolence visit to the deceased’s family. Gawuna, who was in the company of the state police commissioner and the director of the Department of State Services, said five persons had so far been arrested in connection with the murder. He lamented that the incident was coming at a time when the state was mourning the killing of five-year-old Hanifa Abubakar by her teacher. He said, “Government will not tolerate these dastardly acts coming at a time when we are doing all we can to ensure peace in Kano. That was why Governor Ganduje insisted on quickly signing the death warrant of the killer of Hanifa Abubakar.” The state Commissioner of Police, Mr Habu Sani, said the police discovered that drug addiction was behind most heinous crimes in the state. While confirming the arrest of the five suspects, he said investigation was ongoing. He explained that the deceased’s two injured children were in a hospital receiving medical attention for the wounds they sustained during the attack. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
