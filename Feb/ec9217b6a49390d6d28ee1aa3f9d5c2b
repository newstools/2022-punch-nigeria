The Lagos State Agency for Mass Education has commenced an advocacy campaign aimed at promoting mass literacy and vocational skills among residents of Epe community. An Assistant Director in the agency, Mrs Olaide Oladunjoye, said this at an event in Epe, according to a statement on Sunday. She said, “The agency intends to ensure both young and old residents of the state have the opportunity to acquire vocational skills that will enable them to become self-reliant and contribute meaningfully to the economic development of the society. “We have organised adult literacy classes at various primary schools in Epe and two vocational centres located at Kasali Oluwo Street and Odo-Iragushin. After the nine-month literacy programme, trainees will move to the next stage and those interested in vocational training such as fashion designing, catering, hairdressing and digital skills, among others, will be trained and sponsored by the Lagos State government. “Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s agenda on education is key and we will attain this by ensuring that the inhabitants of Epe and Lagos at large benefit from this mass literacy and vocational training programme because society is governed when its members are well educated.” The Oloja of Epe land, Oba Kamoruden Animashaun, commended the effort of the agency and urged the trainees to be diligent and maximise the rare opportunity provided by the government to acquire desired vocational skills.
