Egypt coach Carlos Queiroz and his assistant Wael Gomaa will miss the Africa Cup of Nations final against Senegal on Sunday, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The pair was sent off after they had altercations with referee Bakary Gassama during Thursday’s nervy semi-final clash at the Olembe stadium, where the North Africans edged hosts Cameroon 3-1 on penalties. Queiroz was sent off in additional time after he was seen on the touchline querying Gassama for not sending off Cameroon’s Nouhou Tolo for allegedly punching his player Ramadan Sobhi. Gomaa was also cautioned minutes after Queiroz’s expulsion. He had bagged a yellow card in their quarter-final win over Morocco, which ruled him out of the final on Sunday. Despite Vincent Aboubakar leading the way by scoring the first spot-kick for the Indomitable Lions,trio Harold Moukoudi, James Lea Siliki and Clinton N’Jie missed their penalties during the shootout, ending their dream of a sixth AFCON title. Meanwhile, Cameroon will face Burkina Faso in the third-place final Saturday.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
