Gunmen have again killed two persons at a mining site in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State. It was learnt that the victims who were identified as youths had gone to the mining site located at Yelwa-Zangam community on Tuesday morning when the gunmen attacked them, killing two on the spot while others escaped. Residents of Dong community in the same local government had last month staged a protest after gunmen killed four youths at a mining site in the area. The President of Anaguta Development Association, Sunday Bunu, confirmed the latest killings to The PUNCH in Jos on Tuesday. Bunu said, “We were at a meeting with the state Commissioner for Tourism when I received a call over the killing. “From what I was told, some Fulani people went to a school in the community to graze with their cows but the vigilante told them that they don’t allow cows to graze there. “So, the vigilante drove the cows out of the school. As the cows were running, they ran towards a mining site where some of our youths who went out in the morning were carrying out their mining activities in the community. “Those youths did not know why the cows were running neither were they the ones that chased the cows away from grazing at the school. “But before you knew it, some other Fulani men who saw the cows running, emerged from the bush and attacked the youth working at the mining site without knowing why the cows were running. “Unfortunately, they succeeded in killing two of the youth while others managed to escape.” The spokesman of the state Police Command, Ubah Ogaba, could not be reached for comment on the incident as calls put across to his mobile telephone line rang out.
