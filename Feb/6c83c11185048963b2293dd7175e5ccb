Kidnap kingpin, Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike aka Evans, and two others have been sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiracy and kidnapping of a businessman, Donatus Duru. The other two convicts are Uche Amadi and Okwuchukwu Nwachukwu while one Ogechi Uchechukw and two former soldiers, Chilaka Ifeanyi and Victor Aduba, were acquitted for lack of sufficient evidence against them. Evans and the two others were found guilty of two-count at the Ikeja High Court in Lagos, presided over by Justice Hakeem Oshodi on Friday. According to Justice Oshodi, the prosecution succeeded in proving the charges against the three convicts beyond reasonable doubt. This is as he revealed that video evidence of when Evans was interrogated didn’t show him under duress “He was seen freely laughing and willingly answered questions. A close look at his body showed no sign of torture. He did not look unkempt. He was seen laughing even when he was told that he must be a rich kidnapper,” Justice Oshodi said. “He showed no remorse in the dock and tried to lie his way out of the crimes despite the video evidence,” he added.
