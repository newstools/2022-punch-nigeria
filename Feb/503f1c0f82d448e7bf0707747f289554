Contractors and other stakeholders in the Niger Delta have called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to order the management of the Niger Delta Development Commission to pay them for contracts executed for the commission. The spokesman for the Niger Delta Indigenous Contractors Association, Dressman Darlinton-Gbolobofa; the National President, Forum for Niger Delta Stakeholders, Kelvin Gigi; and Sylvester Tonye, for the other stakeholders, made the plea at a press conference in Abuja on Thursday. They said following the intervention by some critical stakeholders from various sectors, the protesting contractors and consultants of the Niger Delta Development Commission decided to suspend the protest at the NDDC gate temporarily. “The Niger Delta indigenous contractors will continue to request the NDDC to pay for services rendered creditably as competent and performing contractors of the NDDC, while frowning on a situation where contractors will not be mobilised by the NDDC to execute projects, a situation where the contractors will borrow money from banks at high interest rates to execute projects, yet will be owed for five years and more without payment,” they added.
