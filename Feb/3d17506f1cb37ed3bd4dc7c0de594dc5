There was palpable tension in the Ede community of Osun State on Friday as police operatives invaded the hideout of a wanted cultist, Rasidi Oko’lu, where a dead body was reportedly found. It will be recalled that Oko’lu had allegedly shot dead one Hassan Adedeji, a Higher National Diploma graduate of Banking and Finance of the Federal Polytechnic, Ede, said to be awaiting his call up letter and was also a commercial motorcyclist. Residents of the Oja-timi area of Ede, who pleaded for anonymity for safety reasons, said they heard gunshots and were forced to stay indoors in the afternoon to avoid being shot. It was also learnt that patrol vans manned by soldiers and police operatives were moving around identified volatile areas in the community. Speaking with The PUNCH, Osun police command Public Relations Officer, Yemisi Opalola, said two people believed to be working with the prime suspect had been arrested. Opalola, also said the operatives that invaded the building used as a hideout by the suspect discovered the corpse of a man, believed to have been killed by Oko’lu. Opalola said, “We are still on the trail of the prime suspect and his men. Operatives that went on his trail burst the place he was using as a hideout. “In the building, the corpse of a man, which we strongly suspect he killed, was discovered. We have two suspects in our custody already. “Our men are on ground, especially in already identified volatile areas in the town. People should not panic. The situation is under control.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
