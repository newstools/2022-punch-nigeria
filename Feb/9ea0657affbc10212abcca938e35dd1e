The Component II Manager, European Union Agents for Citizen-driven Transformation Programme, Ideem Udoekong, has called on the Nigerian government to allow Civil Society Organisations actively participate in the laws regulating them. According to him, a bill seeking to address regulatory and administrative issues, among others, for non-governmental organisations in the country recently scaled second reading at the Senate. Udoekong said he believed that allowing the NGOs to participate in the process would make the laws more inclusive and acceptable, thereby improving the level of compliance among the organisations. He spoke at a meeting of the Steering Committee of the Civil Society Regulatory Environment in Abuja on Friday. Udoekong said, “The CSOs must be allowed to make contributions towards how they are regulated and also, they must be allowed to actively participate in the process of regulation. “With this, it is then hoped that the laws that are regulating the CSOs will be more appropriate, more inclusive and more acceptable. “We are not saying the CSOs should not be regulated; if you want to hold people accountable, you must be accountable yourself. “We believe the CSOs will comply more if they are involved in all the required processes.” He also called for a thorough examination of the existing laws on CSOs in the country. Udoekong said, “In relation to the existing laws on the CSOs, the laws should be looked at thoroughly and very objectively, because some aspects are not very clear; some of them were borrowed from other countries.”  Copyright PUNCH.
