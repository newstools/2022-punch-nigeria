Table tennis legend, Funke Oshonaike, has survived an auto crash, she announced in a post on her Facebook page on Wednesday. Her car, as seen in the photos she shared, was badly damaged after it hit the rail which was by the side of the road she was travelling on. Stating that she’s still shocked by the experience, Oshonaike, thanked God for saving her life and giving her a second chance to live. The table tennis legend, however, failed to state whether she sustained injury or not. She captioned the photos: “HE SAVED ME. What can I say or write? I am still in pain, shocked and traumatised! “Thank God that no RIP is written on my picture. Thank you God for giving me another chance to live, for making me see my kids again. “Though my new baby car got destroyed completely, God saved me. I know that He will stop all these storms that didn’t take my life away, and give me back my real laughter soon. “I know He will sure surprise me and bless me (some) more soon. I will forever be grateful to God for saving me.” Photos courtesy Funke Oshonaike Facebook   Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
