The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has raised the alarm that victims of the Internally Displaced Persons’ camp fire in Borno State are in urgent need of food, shelter and other basic items. The UN agency, which is mandated to aid and protect refugees and stateless people and to assist in their voluntary repatriation, also disclosed that the death toll in the fire has risen to three. The humanitarian agency, however, called on national agencies and ministries of government to rise to the occasion. This was contained in a statement on Friday by the head of the agency, Yabawa Kolo. The statement read, “Death toll rises to three as fire destroys 3,000 shelters in Nigerian IDP camp. “Authorities in Nigeria confirmed the death of three people this week after fire ripped through a camp for internally displaced people in the Borno State capital, Maiduguri. “Families left homeless by the fire are in urgent need of food, shelter and basic household items, appealing to national agencies and ministries for help. “The latest tragedy followed similar incidents in camps and communities hosting IDPs in Borno State, including a recent deadly fire in Jere in which two people died. “Borno State is currently home to more than two million IDPs, most of whom have fled an ongoing insurgency by militants in the North East of Nigeria.”  Copyright PUNCH.
