The Chancellor, Gregory University, Uturu, Abia, Greg Ibe, said his scholarship scheme has selected 350 indigent students from three senatorial districts of the state to boost their education. Ibe, represented by the Director-General, Gregory Iyke Foundation, Emeka Okafor, said this during the launch of his Education Intervention Scheme for Abia Central Senatorial District in Umuahia on Thursday. He said the beneficiaries belonged to the 2020/2021 academic session and that the list of those for the 2021/2022 session would soon be published. He noted that the scheme was initiated to reduce the burden of education on indigent parents. The chancellor said the scheme was packaged in four categories, including the distribution of exercise books, textbooks, scholarships and online entrepreneurship training. According to him, online entrepreneurship training will teach the youths about requisite skills for successful entrepreneurship. He urged the students to take their studies seriously in order to lay a solid foundation for successful careers in future. He further admonished them to shun the get-rich-quick syndrome and avoid internet fraud, armed robbery and other criminal acts. “The education you acquire today is the foundation you have laid for yourself and at the end, you will reap the fruit. “In life, you must first cultivate before harvesting and reaping. It is only a thief that will not cultivate but expects to reap. “That is why wealth acquired by thieves does not last but wealth from one’s efforts and struggles will always outlive him,” the chancellor said. He also encouraged the students to develop an interest in entrepreneurship in order to become self-employed and employers of labour after their education. (NAN)
