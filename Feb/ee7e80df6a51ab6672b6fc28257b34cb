Big Brother Naija season four winner, Mercy Eke, on Sunday stated that she wasn’t looking to be good in everyone’s eyes. The BBNaija ‘Pepper Dem’ winner stated this on her Twitter page while replying to a tweet from a supporter. A fan with the handle @stan_mercyeke wrote, “Mercy Eke will never do enough in some people’s eyes no matter the good she does.” Quoting the tweet, the reality TV star wrote, “I’m not looking to be good in everyone’s eyes, my love. I’m a successful woman. So irrespective of how nice and goodhearted I am, I will always have people who will totally and absolutely hate me.” Commenting on the reality TV star’s tweet, a BBNaija season six finalist, Angel Smith, hailed Mercy for mastering self love. Agreeing to what Mercy tweeted, Angel wrote, “And for no reason too. I’m so glad you’ve mastered self love because let me tell you something; you’re phenomenal. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.” While wishing her fans a happy Sunday on her Twitter page, Mercy also encouraged them to be hungry for achievement. Mercy wrote, “Just have hunger for achievement. You’ll always have the power inside you to realise it. Happy Sunday, my loves.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
