Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in ward 10 of Etsako East Local Government Area of Edo State, Vitalis Eshokene, on Thursday called on the former National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole, to vie for the Edo North senatorial seat in 2023. Eshokene also disclosed that party faithful and loyalists would mobilise to purchase nomination form for Oshiomhole to demonstrate their resolve to have him contest the Edo North Senatorial seat. Eshokene told newsmen that “Edo State and the Senatorial district need a strong representation more than what we are getting now. Edo State has not got the right kind of representation and Edo North has been the worst hit in this. “Comrade Adams Oshiomhole has demonstrated what he can do as a labour leader, as governor of the state and as national chairman of the party. Our people in Edo north need adequate representation more than we are getting and Comrade Oshiomhole fits the kind of person Edo North needs in the Senate.” He appealed to Oshiomhole to listen to the voices of the people in the district and contest the Senatorial seat.
