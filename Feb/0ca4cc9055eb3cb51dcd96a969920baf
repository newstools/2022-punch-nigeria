The management of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, has issued a query to the owner of BVER, a private hostel on the campus of the institution, where a student lost her life. A second-year student in the Department of Linguistics and African Languages, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, Ajibola Heritage Ayomikun, who resided in the hostel reportedly fell into a septic tank of the hostel through an opening that was allegedly not properly covered. Giving an update on the incident in a press release obtained in Osogbo on Friday, the Public Relations Officer of the University, Abiodun Olarewaju, said the response of the hostel owner to the query was being awaited. The release read in part, “The owner of the private hostel, BVER, where the incidence occurred has been issued a query by the University Management and his response is being awaited. “It must be noted that all the hostels in the students’ village are privately owned and they are not under the control of the University. The University Management presently has only oversight functions on these private hostels.” Meanwhile, the University also said the Criminal Investigation Department of the Osun State Command of the Nigeria Police Force, has taken over the investigation into the circumstances that led to the death of the student.
