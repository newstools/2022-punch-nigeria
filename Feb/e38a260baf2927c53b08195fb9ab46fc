Operatives of the Delta State Police Command have arrested 11 suspected cultists. Recall that five people were killed in a cult clash between the Eiye Confraternity and the Black Axe Confraternity in Agbarho, in the Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State on February 6. The state Commissioner of Police, Muhammed Ali, was said to have directed the joint forces of the command’s Anti-Cult Unit, Dragon Patrol Team, and police operatives from the Agbarho division to restore sanity in the community. The Divisional Police Officer, Agbarho division, CSP Sam Ogwa, was said to have led the teams in an operation that led to the arrest of 11 suspects, who allegedly participated in the cult clash. Two pump-action guns, one cut-to-size locally-made gun, eight expended cartridges and 10 rounds of live ammunition were reportedly recovered from the suspects. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe, who confirmed the development in a statement on Tuesday, said a manhunt for other fleeing suspects was ongoing. “The Commissioner of Police, while calling on members of the public to help with any useful information that could lead to the arrest of the fleeing suspects, urged parents and guardians to monitor, guide and caution their children and wards to desist from cult-related activities,” the statement added.
