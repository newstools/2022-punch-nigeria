The leadership of the All Progressives Congress in Ila Federal Constituency, on Tuesday, declared support for Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, ahead of Saturday’s governorship primary. Rising from the meeting held at Chief Bisi Akande’s residence in Ila, the Deputy Speaker, Osun House of Assembly, Femi Popoola, who read the communique, said party members had endorsed Oyetola for a second term, following his excellent performance in office. Popoola said the party leaders of APC at the Federal Constituency agreed to work for Oyetola’s re-election come July 16th, 2022. The communique reads in part, “Having monitored, evaluated and reviewed the performances of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola in office, members of the All Progressives Congress, Ila/Boluwaduro/ Ifedayo Federal Constituency hereby noted that the Governor has recorded outstanding performance in Office and thus deserves to be re-elected. “The name, Gboyega Oyetola, is on the lips of old and young, male and female residents, indigenes and non-indigenes of the State and beyond. This is because the Governor has etched his name in the sands of time with his leadership qualities and managerial know-how. “Considering that there is presently no individual among the array of aspirants to the office of the Executive Governor of the State of Osun that can match the credential of the incumbent Governor in experience and personality, and the need for continuity of people-oriented projects and lofty programmes embarked upon by his administration, hence, the need for us to adopt and endorse him as our candidate in the forthcoming governorship election.” Copyright PUNCH.
