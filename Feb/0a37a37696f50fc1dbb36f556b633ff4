The Governor of Kwara State, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, has condemned attempts by some fifth columnists to polarise the state along religious lines, using the issue of hijab in public schools “as a smokescreen to advance their evil intent.” This is as he pointed out that Kwara State is a plural society whose diversity and peaceful coexistence as the southernmost northern state are its most unique selling points. This was disclosed in a statement titled, ‘Our Stand On Hijab Based On Law, Respect for Pluralism,’ signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Rafiu Ajakaye, on Tuesday. The statement read in part, “For the avoidance of doubt, the Governor maintains the earlier position of the state government on the question of hijaab as follows: “Based on subsisting Court judgments which were built on the Constitution, federal and state laws, principle of pluralism, and sanctity of the right of every person to their identity, especially in public space, the use of hijaab in public schools is a constitutional right that the government shall protect for anyone and everyone willing to use it. “The government’s strategic patience in the handling of delicate matters involving the people it swore to protect is not same as pandering to anyone’s whims. “Consequently, the Governor stands firmly by government’s policy on the permissibility of hijaab for every Muslim girl child who desires to wear it in all public schools. “The Governor appeals to the people of the state to not allow agents of fake news and disinformation to mislead them and set them against one another. This administration, to be sure, is beholden only to the law, truth and fairness to all at all times.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
