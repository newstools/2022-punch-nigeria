The Edo State Police Command has confiscated over 2,000 logs of wood at the Gelegele Seaport as part of efforts to rid the state of illegal loggers. At the seaport on Wednesday, the state police spokesperson, SP Bello Kontongs, said the loggers escaped after jumping into the river. Kontongs also stated that the logs were being shipped to Lagos State for onward transmission to other parts of the world. He said the logs that were intercepted in Ondo State would be sent back to Edo State. He said, “At the seaport here are the logs of wood seized from illegal loggers. The 2,000 log seizure was done after Governor Godwin Obaseki gave an order to the Commissioner of Police, Philip Ogbadu, to arrest and check the activities of these criminals. “The state government has banned the felling of trees in the 49 forest reserves in the state. The wood is being taken illegally to all parts of the world, which the state government is against. The forest reserves are for the benefit of all Edo people. “Also, the illegal activities of these loggers are impacting negatively on wildlife. The recovered logs will be handed over to the state government by the CP in due course.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
