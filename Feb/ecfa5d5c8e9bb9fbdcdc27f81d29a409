Despite suffering two consecutive defeats in the Nigeria Professional Football League, Remo Stars media officer, Oladimeji Oshode, said the team was confident of bouncing back, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The Ikenne-Remo, Ogun State club had an impressive start to the 2021/22 NPFL season and were unbeaten in 11 games, but suffered their first defeat to Gombe United on match-day 12. Three days later, the Gbenga Ogunbote-led side were dealt another heavy blow in their title ambition as David Onovo’s 27th-minute strike was enough to condemn them to another defeat as Akwa United claimed all three points in Ikenne. Speaking with PUNCH Sports Extra, Oladimeji hailed Ogunbote for doing a great job, adding that they were confident of getting their season back on track. “We are definitely happy with Ogunbote because this is someone who has gone 11 matches unbeaten; we have no choice but to appreciate his efforts. “Though we are not happy we lost at home, but that is football and these things are bound to happen. “We’ve had a share of the wins, the draws and now the defeats but just have to take out some positive notes from the game and work on areas that need improving on and focus on our subsequent games. “The management and fans of the club are calm but we just want to put the defeats behind us and return back to winning ways.” Up next for Remo Stars as they hope to bounce back from their defeats is a trip to Benue, where they tackle Lobi Stars on the match-day 14 of the NPFL season.
