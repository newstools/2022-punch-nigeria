The All Progressives Grand Alliance in Enugu State has condemned the outcome of the local government election in the state, saying the state electoral body connived with the ruling party, the People’s Democratic Party to intimidate and harass the opposition parties in the election. Recall that the PDP recorded a clean sweep in the election held in the 17 Local Government Areas of Enugu State on Wednesday. The state chairman of APGA, Ndubuisi Enechionyia; and secretary, Dickson Ani, in a statement on Sunday, said there was short and non-availability of ENSIEC staff members and electoral materials for various venues used for the election. “The party decries the activities and actions of the Mr Ajogwu led Enugu State Independent Electoral Commission which reneged on their statutory oaths and betrayed the mandate imposed on them. The party condemns in totality the gravity of electoral harassment, intimidation, violence, assault and malpractices displayed by the ruling party in the state in collaboration with the Electoral Commission and its officers wherein lives and properties were lost. “The party further detests and rejects the pre-written electoral results declared by ENSIEC even in many glaring areas where no elections were conducted, and calls on ENSIEC to immediately withdraw the illegal certificates of return issued to the candidates of the People’s Democratic Party. “The party calls on our teeming supporters to remain calm and resolute as we commence the process of nullification of the outcome of the irresponsible conduct of a clearly biased electoral body, which is against the will of the people,” the statement partly read.
