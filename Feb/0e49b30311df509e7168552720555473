Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has approved March 11 as the date to install Oba Lekan Balogun as the new Olubadan of Ibadanland. The date was contained in a circular dated February 22 and issued on Tuesday by the Office of the State Commissioner, Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs. The circular marked CB 211/10/155 was addressed to Balogun and a copy sent to the Chairman, Ibadan South-East Local Government Area. The circular titled, “Installation ceremony: Olubadan of Ibadan,” is a reply to an earlier letter from the monarch on his installation. It read, “I wish to refer to a letter No.IBSELG.243/17 of February 16, 2022 on the above subject and inform you that His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Oyo State has approved Friday, March 11, 2022 as the date of the installation of the new Olubadan of Ibadan. Once again, congratulations, Kabiyesi.” The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Dr B. A. Olanrewaju, signed the two-paragraph circular. The throne became vacant following the death of Oba Saliu Adetunji on January 2, 2022 at the age of 93. After the initial controversies which trailed Balogun’s nomination ended, the governor had on February 14 approved the nomination of the 79-year-old former federal lawmaker who is expected to be installed as the 42nd Olubadan of Ibadanland.
