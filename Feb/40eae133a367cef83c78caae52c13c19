Osun state government has promised to spare no effort in arresting people who sponsor youths in the state to foment trouble. The warning was a sequel to recent instances of cult-related violence in Ilesha and Ede towns. The government in a statement signed by the Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Funke Egbemode, on Sunday described the incidents as criminal and dastardly. It, however, assured residents that the various security agencies of the state are working together to apprehend the perpetrators and deal with them according to the law. The statement reads in part, “The current spate of killings in Ilesha and Ede are cult-related, and the security architecture of the state has briefed the governor. But as security strategies are not issues to be discussed in the media, the government cannot disclose details of what its operatives are doing. “We can only assure citizens and residents of Osun that everything is being done and will continue to be done within the ambits of the law to apprehend those who are arming young people to foment trouble in the state. “Intelligence reports also show that those funding these activities are the reason the cultists are emboldened. In Osun, nobody who runs foul of the law will be spared. A criminal is a criminal, whether old or young, poor or highly placed.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
