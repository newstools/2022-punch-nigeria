THE Gombe State Governor, Muhammadu Yahaya, on Thursday returned to the state after a 30-day vacation. The governor had left the state on January 3, 2022, for a working vacation and returned on February 3 amid cheers from his teeming supporters who trooped to the Government House to welcome him. According to him, this was the first time since the inception of his administration he would be out of the state for such a while. “My longest vacation never exceeded a period of two weeks,” Yahaya added. He lauded party members, government officials and youths and women who accompanied him from the airport to the government house, adding that such an action shows solidarity. The governor added that youths and women were the backbones of his political movement while promising to reciprocate through more dividends of democracy. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
