Viewers of dance reality TV show, Glo Battle of the Year Nigeria, are in for lots of drama and amazing dance moves as the second episode of the show airs. BBoy dancers who made it through the audition and elimination stages are battling it out in the quarterfinal stages and they all bring their A-game. According to a statement by the headline sponsor of the show, Globacom, the response has been overwhelmingly positive. The statement added, “We are getting downloads of our GloTv app and heavy traction on social media. This is proof that young Nigerians are invested in seeing how these talents are being empowered to achieve their dreams.” Indeed, the second episode of the show mirrors the saying that ‘all is fair in love and war’ as two brothers battle it out in Kaduna in a delightful case of sibling rivalry. Two members of the same dance crew also go head-to-head in Lagos, while a past winner of the show is almost vanquished in Kaduna. In Benin (Edo State), a coup almost leads to the toppling of the president of the dancers association. With mega-millions at stake and an opportunity to represent Nigeria at the Battle of the Year Nigeria competition in Japan, participants are bringing on their A-game as they ‘bust’ moves and turn acrobatic tricks. However, one of the judges, JC Jedor, stated that though ‘moves and tricks are good’, the qualities that determine who wins are ‘energy, precision, skills and clean execution, plus a battle-ready mindset.” Copyright PUNCH.
