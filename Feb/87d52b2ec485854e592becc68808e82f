Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc has rewarded winners of its maiden ‘Prize For Innovations’ challenge, which began last year. The firm said their ideas could be scaled to realise a sustainable transformation of Nigeria’s agri-food system. It said it had initiated the motivation and reward challenge to spur agricultural stakeholders into proactively devising sustainable solutions to some of the peculiar challenges in the food value chain. Several small and medium-scale enterprises submitted entries under category 1 of the challenge, such as solar-powered storage systems, hydroponic farming solutions, bio-recycling plants, and novel methods of generating electricity from food waste. The five finalists from the category were unveiled in a live pitch event held in Lagos on Friday and adjudged by a panel of notable experts in the food industry, including the Chief Executive Officer of FATE Foundation, Adenike Adeyemi; and the Managing Partner of Sahel Capital Agribusiness Managers Limited, Mezuo Nwuneli. Others were the Founder and CEO of Tomato Jos Farming and Processing Limited, Mira Mehta; and the Director, Group Strategy and Stakeholder Relations, FMN, Sadiq Usman. Usman said the challenge would be sustained, adding, “It is an effort towards addressing food security needs, bearing in mind the situation that Nigeria is in today.”
