The National Frequency Management Council, an agency of the Federal Government, has handed over the 3.5GHz spectrum allocation for the fifth generation networks to the Nigerian Communications Commission. The handover ceremony was held on Thursday in Abuja, where the Chairman of the Council and Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof Isa Pantami, also presented the National Policy on Fifth Generation Networks for Nigeria’s Digital Economy. This was contained in a press statement by the spokesperson for the minister, Uwa Suleiman, on Thursday. The statement read in part, “The National Frequency Management Council has formally handed over the 3.5GHz spectrum allocation for the deployment of Fifth Generation Networks to the Nigerian Communications Commission.” The minister directed that the spectrum be distributed to the companies whose bids were successful during the auction in December 2021, and urged all stakeholders to ensure the implementation of the National Policy of 5G for Nigeria’s Digital Economy. The NCC auction for its two available lots of 100 MHz TDD slots of 3.5 GHz band for the deployment of 5G network in the country was won by MTN Nigeria and Mafab Nigeria Communications Limited in December last year.
