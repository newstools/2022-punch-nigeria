The contract for the WBC Heavyweight title fight has been signed by Dillian Whyte and Tyson Fury, with the bout expected to hold at the Wembley Stadium in April. Whyte, a WBC interim title holder, will challenge Fury who is the WBC Heavyweight champion. He had earlier knocked out Alexander Povetkin to secure his current title. Speaking on his eagerness to fight Fury, he told Sky Sports. He said, “Wherever they want the fight, whenever they want the fight, I don’t care. “I’ve been trying to fight him for a long time. I’ve been ready to fight him for a long time. “I just want to fight him for the world title now.” On his part, Fury stated that the coming fight will be his easiest because Whyte is not on his level. “In this game, there is levels to it – that’s just the top and bottom of it in boxing – and Dillian Whyte just isn’t at Tyson’s level,” Fury said. “This will be one of Tyson’s easiest fights because you go from Deontay Wilder who can put your lights out in one second with one punch and then you’re going over to Dillian Whyte who has not always looked the best, not always been up there. “He’s taken a while to get this title shot, he’s got a few miles on the clock himself, he’s had a few bad knock-outs – I don’t see him posing any threat. “It’s heavyweight boxing, anything can happen, but as far as him being the best and ruling the division, Tyson is that man and will do for however long he wants to.” Copyright PUNCH.
