The Police in Kano has arrested five suspects over the alleged murder of a 24-year-old housewife, Rukayya Mustapha. Mustapha was killed in her matrimonial home at the Danbare area of Kano metropolis on Saturday. Two of the deceased’s children aged between three and one were also beaten to a pulp by the assailants. The Commissioner of Police, Sama’ila Shu’aibu-Dikko, made the disclosure when the state Deputy Governor, Nasiru Yusuf-Gawuna, paid a condolence visit to the family of the deceased on Monday in Kano. Shu’aibu-Dikko attributed drug abuse as one of the reasons for such heinous criminal acts, adding that the command had arrested many drug peddlers in the state. He said that the children were receiving treatment at a hospital in Kano following the injuries they sustained during the attack. The commissioner revealed that the police had commenced investigation to unravel the circumstances leading to the tragic incident. “Five suspects are already in police net,” he said. Also speaking, Yusuf-Gawuna lamented that the murder came at a time when the state was still mourning Hanifa, who was killed by her teacher. “Government will not tolerate these dastardly acts, coming at a time when we are doing all we could to ensure peace in the state,” he said.
