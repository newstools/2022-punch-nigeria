The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited on Friday said it was working to resolve the distribution hitches that had continued to prolong the three-week scarcity of Premium Motor Spirit popularly called petrol. Petrol scarcity continued on Friday and practically grew worse in Abuja and neighbouring states, as motorists formed massive queues in the few filling stations that dispensed the commodity. Right in front of the corporate headquarters of NNPC in Abuja, motorists had persistently besieged the two filling stations; Conoil and Total that dispense petrol. But in its fuel supply update released on Friday and signed by its spokesperson, Garba-Deen Muhammad, the NNPC stated that it had enough products and was tackling distribution hitches that had been impeding PMS supply. It also stated that the oil firm had engaged the services of security agencies to ensure that products were delivered at the right locations. It said, “NNPC once again assures Nigerians that it has sufficient stock of petroleum products for distribution across the country and is working assiduously with partners to ensure the product reaches every part of the country. “NNPC is further intensifying efforts to resolve distribution hitches being experienced in some parts of the country due to logistics issues. “To this effect, NNPC is engaging depot operators to load product round the clock to accelerate the restoration of normal distribution.” It added, “NNPC has also engaged the services of government security agencies to ensure that oll products loaded get to the night destination.” The oil firm urged Nigerians to continue to be patient as it would continue to strive to restore the situation to normalcy.
