Liverpool legend Michael Owen has heaped plaudits on Watford striker Emmanuel Dennis after his match-winning goal strike secured a 1-0 win over Aston Villa in a Premier League tie at Villa Park on Saturday evening. The Nigerian got ahead of his marker to power home a cross from Ismaila Sarr in the 78th minute to hand Roy Hodgson his first win in four games, although Watford remain in the relegation zone with 18 points from 24 matches. “I was surprised with the last result Burnley and I was equally surprised with this one, Watford winning away at Aston Villa,” Owen said in his post-match analysis. “Dennis, what a player, what a signing he’s been in the Premier League this season, great finish again from him.” The goal was Dennis’ first since December 28, 2021, when he was on target in the Hornets 4-1 loss to West Ham. The 24-year-old has now been directly involved in 14 (nine goals and five assist) of Watford’s 24 Premier League goals this term.
