The Kano State Hisbah Board has intercepted four vehicles with over 4, 200 bottles of assorted beer. The Commander General of the Board, Dr Harun Ibn Sina, made the disclosure while briefing newsmen in Kano on Saturday. According to him, the vehicles were intercepted along Kwanar Dangora-Kiru Madobi and Zaria-Kano roads. The Commander General explained that Kano State Shari’a laws ban consumption and sale of beer and other intoxicants and had set aside stiffer sanctions for those found guilty of the offence. Similarly, he said the Board had succeeded in arresting miscreants engaging in prostitution, drug pushing and other unlawful acts at Panshekara. Ibn Sina said the young men and women were arrested after receiving complaints from residents of the area. He decried over rising cases of underage youth engaged in societal vices that often lead to criminal activities. The Commander General charged citizens of the state to be more vigilant and report any suspected person or character to relevant authorities. He reaffirmed the board’s readiness to partner with relevant stakeholders in eradicating all forms of vices in the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
