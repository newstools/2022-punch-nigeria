SUPER EAGLES striker Odion Ighalo says his compatriot Emmanuel Dennis must score more goals if Watford are to avoid relegation at the end of the season, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The Hornets’ hopes of fighting relegation was swiftly brought back down to earth following a 4-1 defeat at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday. Watford currently sit one point off the bottom of the Premier League table with 18 points from 25 games and they are four points from safety. Ighalo who spent two-and-a-half years at Vicarage Road scoring scored 39 goals in 100 appearances for the club before he moved to Changchun Yatai for £22m in 2017 said the 24-year-old must take his scoring chances to help the Hornets survive relegation. Dennis has stolen the limelight at Vicarage Road this season contributing to 14 (nine goals and five assists) of the 24 goals Watford has scored this season. “He’s (Dennis) a very good player, with good technique, he’s fast, he can score goals, he’s very intelligent,” Ighalo told Watford TV. “He just needs to keep fit and keep taking his chances and scoring goals. “I think if the season is going to turn around and they are going to be safe, they have to keep Dennis, Sarr, and King firing. Get a couple of goals and I think the team can escape relegation.” Dennis will hope to add to his nine-goal tally on his 24th appearance for Watford who face Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday (today). Should he find the back of the net, the former Club Brugges striker will become the fourth Hornets player to score 10 or more goals in a Premier League season after Ighalo, Troy Deeney and Gerard Deulofeu.
