Former Governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido, says he does not believe in regional consensus but a national consensus for the 2023 Presidency. He said this on Thursday during Channels Television’s ‘Politics Today’ programme monitored by The PUNCH. Lamido condemned the idea of zoning, which he said should not exist anymore, as it was designed to be a one-time thing. He said, “For how long do we remain blackmailed and held hostage for zoning? When are we going to have a Nigerian president for all Nigerians? The issue of zoning was a one-time thing designed to heal a particular problem, which has been healed. We are now fully reconciled.” He added that there should be no regional or tribal consensus, as what the country needs is a national consensus. He said, “I don’t believe in regional consensus, either for the south-south, south-east or north. I believe in the Nigeria consensus. “Those clamouring for this consensus are not in active politics They are people outside the arena. I want people within the area with the same feelings and philosophy, who believe in Nigeria, to come together and come up with a Nigeria consensus. I don’t believe in regional or tribal consensus.” He added that the Afenifere and other tribal groups are not active within the political scene, which has made them push for regional consensus. The former governor also said that he is willing to step aside for and support younger people to occupy political offices but they may lack the wisdom and experiences of the older ones.
