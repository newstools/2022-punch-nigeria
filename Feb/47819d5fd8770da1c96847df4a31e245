Ferran Torres slotted in a penalty to rescue a 1-1 draw for Barcelona at home against Napoli in the first leg of their Europa League playoff on Thursday. Piotr Zielinski had opened the scoring for the Italians after 29 minutes in Spain but Torres levelled just before the hour from the spot after a Juan Jesus handball. Nigeria’s striker Victor Osimhen put up an impressive performance but failed to score. The draw leaves the tie open for both teams to advance to the last 16 of Europe’s second-tier club competition with the second leg next week in Italy. The Catalans are playing the Europa League for the first time in 18 years after crashing out of the Champions League in the group stage.
