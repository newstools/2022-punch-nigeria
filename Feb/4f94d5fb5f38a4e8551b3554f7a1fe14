The Nigerian Insurers Association has said insurance companies have paid N11bn claims on losses suffered during the 2020 #EndSARS protest. The Chairman, NIA, Mr Ganiyu Musa, disclosed this at a press briefing in Lagos. “As at January, insurers have paid over N11bn as claims that arose from the #EndSARS protest of 2020,” Musa said. Lootings, destructions and deaths had marred the #EndSARS protests. The NIA had earlier released a report that the claims were paid on vandalisation, lootings, theft; deaths and cases of loss of cash. It added claims were settled on malicious damage; business interruptions; burglary attacks; and on fire and burnt sites. In October 2020, some youths had commenced peaceful protests tagged #EndSARS to demand the disbandment of the Police Special Anti-Robbery Squad and other reforms in the Nigerian Police Force. As the protests persisted, it was taken over by hoodlums who embarked on massive lootings and destructions. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
