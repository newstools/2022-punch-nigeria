Senate Deputy Minority Leader, Senator Emmanuel Bwacha, has joined the All Progressives Congress from the Peoples Democratic Party. He was welcomed to the APC by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), along with APC Caretaker Chairman and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni. Earlier, Mohammed Hassan, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party and a former senator representing Yobe South, also defected to APC. This is contained in a statement by Alhaji Mamman Mohammed, Director-General, Press and Media Affairs to Gov. Mai Mala Bun in Damaturu on Wednesday. Mohammed said Hassan aka ‘Dambu’ made the formal defection on Tuesday in Abuja and was received by Buni, who is also the Chairman APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee. “The defection of Hassan was witnessed by the President of Senate, Ahmad Lawan, Sen. Ibrahim Bomoi, the Minister of Power, Mr Abubakar Aliyu and the state APC Chairman Alhaji Muhammadu Gadaka. “The exit of the former legislator has created a huge vacuum to the opposition party at both the state and national levels,” he said. Mohammed said that Hassan pledged his loyalty and support to the party leadership in the state and to work for its success at all levels. He noted that the defection would increase the fortunes of the APC in Zone ‘B’, comprising Fune, Potiskum, Nangere and Fika Local Government Areas of the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
