Activist and founder of #RevolutionNow Movement, Omoyele Sowore, was allegedly arrested by the police on Thursday in Abuja. This was disclosed in a statement signed by the National Publicity Secretary, African Action Congress, Femi Adeyeye, the party under whose platform Sowore ran as a presidential candidate during the 2019 election. The statement noted that Sowore was arrested “just after stepping out of the Court where the Chairman, party leaders and members had converged to witness the party’s case against Independent National Electoral Commission and usurpers.” Sowore, who is the publisher of Sahara Reporters – an online newspaper, had filed an appeal against the ruling of the Federal High Court that declared Leonard Nzenwa the acting Chairman of the AAC. Adeyeye added that the activist was taken to the former Special Anti Robbery Squad, infamously called “Abattoir”, noting that the officers did not give any reason for his arrest. “As at the time of releasing this statement that he is currently at the dreaded SARS unit called ‘Abattoir’ and men from that station were the ones who carried out the arrest. “We are monitoring these events and we can assure all members that these recurring illegalities and attacks won’t be allowed to stand. Specific reason(s) for his arrest remain sketchy at this time.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
