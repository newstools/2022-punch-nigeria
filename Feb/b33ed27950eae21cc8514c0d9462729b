The Tinubu Support Group says All Progressives Congress chieftain and 2023 presidential hopeful, Bola Tinubu, is not giving out grants. The group described as fraudulent, an online portal promoting what it termed the ‘Tinubu Support Grant’. The portal reportedly asked Nigerians to ‘Hurry now and check if you are eligible to receive N25,000 support fund as part of Tinubu Support Grant’. But in a statement on Thursday, the spokesman for the pro-Tinubu group, Tosin Adeyanju, said “the portal is fake and certainly does not enjoy the authorization of Tinubu.” The statement was titled, ‘TSG dissociates self from online platform promoting grant’. Adeyanju said, “The objective of the criminals behind this scam is to defraud unsuspecting members of the public by advertising the identity of Alhaji Tinubu as being associated with the fraud. “We warn supporters of Alhaji Ahmed Tinubu and the general public not to patronize any portal called Tinubu Support grant. “We call on law enforcement agencies to track and arrest the individuals behind this online crime and identity forgery and bring them to face the law.” Copyright PUNCH.
