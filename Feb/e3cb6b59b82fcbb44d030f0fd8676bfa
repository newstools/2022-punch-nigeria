The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has dragged an online publisher, Jackson Ude, before a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory in Abuja over alleged libellous publication. The minister, in the suit filed by his lawyer, Taofeek Yahaya, joined the editor of the publication, Uduma Mba, as second defendant in the matter. In the writ of summons dated January 21, 2022 and signed by his counsel, the plaintiff is seeking N50bn damages. A copy of the court process was obtained by journalists in Abuja on Sunday. According to the document, the defendants in the publication, Pointblanknews, alleged that the minister was involved in a N10bn fraud, adding that the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission has commenced investigating the matter. Mohammed said the report published on August 3, 2022 in Pointbalnknews.com was circulated worldwide and has caused damage to his reputation. He prayed the court to restrain the defendants from further publishing defamatory reports against him. According to the writ of summons, one of the witnesses listed to give evidence in the matter is the minister, who is expected to lead evidence. The case is yet to be assigned to a judge.
