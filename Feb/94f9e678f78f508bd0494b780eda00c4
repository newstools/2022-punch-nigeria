The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, has expressed commitment to tackling the economic challenges facing Nigeria’s economy. Emefiele, represented by the Corporate Communications Director, CBN, Osita Nwanisoba, stated this at the end of a two-day CBN Fair in Asaba. He said, “CBN is passionate about empowering youths, especially young graduates through various initiatives to support small and medium scale enterprises as well as agricultural support schemes. “Our various programmes are targeted at youth empowerment and restructuring of the Nigerian economy in order to move it away from its over-dependence on oil revenue. “The unprecedented rice pyramid witnessed in Abuja, recently and the over 160 per cent rise in the number of rice mills in the country is evidence that the CBN’s intervention in the agriculture sector was yielding fruits. “There is need for all hands to be on the deck to tackle the economic challenges facing Nigeria” He added that the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme of the apex bank and other development finance interventions greatly helped in mitigating the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria through the various palliatives that Nigerians benefited from. He noted that growing a diversified economy that would meet contemporary challenges in a sustainable manner underscored the intervention programmes of the apex bank. Copyright PUNCH.
