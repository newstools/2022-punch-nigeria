A Nigerian edtech firm, Teesas, has been selected to the Elite 200, the list of semifinalists in the GSV Cup, the world’s largest pitch competition for edtech startups. According to a statement, companies selected to the Elite 200 represent the top pre-seed and seed-stage startups in digital learning across the “Pre-K to Gray” space. It said Teesas would now compete for up to $1m in cash and prizes in San Diego this April at the ASU+GSV Summit, the annual education technology event hosted by Arizona State University and GSV Ventures, a venture capital firm. The statement said Teesas was selected from a global applicant pool of over 750 companies. It said more than 175 judges from leading venture capital firms and strategic partners in digital learning like Accel, General Atlantic, Reach Capital, and Owl Ventures, used rigorous criteria to determine the 200 most promising companies. The founder and Chief Executive Officer, Teesas, Osayi Izedonmwen, said, “We are elated that we’ve been selected as one of The Elite 200, just a few months after we closed a $1.6m pre-seed round. All of us at Teesas feel like winners already. We thank GSV Ventures for the recognition and their commitment to uplifting edtech startups globally.” “We’re at a critical and exciting time for the future of society,” said the Managing Partner of GSV Ventures, Deborah Quazzo. “We’ve always imagined a new era in which ALL people have equal access to the future, and this year’s Elite 200 companies are emblematic of that vision. We’re proud to name the 200 semifinalists in the GSV Cup competition and look forward to having them pitch live at the ASU+GSV Summit.” The GSV Cup is powered by Google Cloud, HubSpot for Startups, HolonIQ, and GSV Ventures, according to the statement.
