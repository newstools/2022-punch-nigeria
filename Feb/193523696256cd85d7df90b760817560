TechQuest STEM Academy, a nonprofit technology education provider, has partnered with IHS Nigeria Limited, an independent owner, operator, and developer of shared telecommunications infrastructure, to improve digital literacy and the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education  by building digital capabilities of secondary school teachers. In a statement, the Executive Director of TechQuest STEM Academy, Dr Itoro Emembolu, was quoted as saying, “The reason we’re carrying out this training programme is to support teachers across Nigeria with the requisite knowledge and skill to build the capacity of their students in science and technology. “We are starting with Lagos State and will extend to 10 states soon. We believe that the practical aspects of education would help to encourage young children and students to engage with the sciences, technology or STEM in general.” She added that since STEM is the foundation for modern-day economic growth, equipping young people with the required skills is critical if Nigeria wants to fully reap the benefits of a digital economy. According to the organisers, the Mission-T app provides indigenous STEM and ICT content to make knowledge transfer more practical and interactive for the teachers. They added that the app comes fully equipped with relevant resources. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
