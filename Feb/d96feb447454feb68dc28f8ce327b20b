In this episode of So This Happened, we reviewed the Osun State APC primary where Governor Gboyega Oyetola defeated other aspirants including the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola’s preferred choice, Moshood Adeoti. We also reviewed the story of a corpse held at the LASUTH morgue for a debt amounting to N860,000, which the family has not been able to raise. Lastly, 19-year-old Collins Sambaya was sadly nailed to a tree in Kenya on the suspicion that he stole a radio. He was rescued by the police and taken for medical attention. Copyright PUNCH.
