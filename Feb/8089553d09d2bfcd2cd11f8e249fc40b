Kingsley Moghalu, former Central Bank of Nigeria’s Deputy Governor, has urged Nigerian youths to join forces with younger politicians in order to dislodge ‘the old brigade politicians’ from the scene in 2023. He explained that to take the mantle of leadership, there was a need for the youth to actively participate in politics beyond rhetorics on social media by joining viable third force platforms excluding All Progressives Congress and People Democratic Party. Moghalu, who was the 2019 presidential candidate of the Young Progressives Party, made the call in a post on his Twitter page on Sunday. The presidential hopeful noted that the only way to win against old and money-bags politicians was to be united, adding that replacing known politicians requires working together. He tweeted, “The old brigade politicians (and their accomplices, some of who may wear “new” faces) know their time is over. So they plan to unleash in 2023 a desperate, never-seen-before onslaught with money stolen from our commonwealth. The only way we can stand against them is together. “I again call on all young and progressive citizens who want real change in our country and aspire to elective political offices at all levels to join @ADCNig and the emerging Third Force. Working together, we will change Nigeria’s trajectory. WE CAN AND WE MUST.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
