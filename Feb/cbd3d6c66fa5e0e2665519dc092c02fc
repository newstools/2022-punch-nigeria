The Joint Universities Preliminary Examinations Board has delisted Delta State University, Abraka, from being an affiliate member after it cancelled the 2021 preliminary examinations held in the school over alleged widespread examination malpractices. This was contained in a letter addressed to the University’s Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Andy Egwunyenga. The letter read partly, “Following the report received from the investigative panel regarding the conduct of the 2021 JUPEB examinations, the academic board and the JUPEB governing board approved that the indicted universities be delisted as an affiliate member of JUPEB for five years, and the results of the examinations conducted in these universities be cancelled due to widespread malpractices”. It read further, “Delta State University is one of the indicted universities hence, the vice Chancellor is hereby notified of the approval of JUPEB governing board. “The governing board of JUPEB is also displeased with this outcome of event, which was due to poor conduct of examinations in the university. “The governing board of JUPEB at an emergency meeting held on January 25, 2022 has therefore directed that all students currently registered for 2021/2022 session of the programme in your university be moved to the nearest affiliate university to write the 2022 JUPEB examinations”.
