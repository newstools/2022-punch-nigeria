Coach of Remo Stars Gbenga Ogunbote says his side didn’t deserve to lose, after they were beaten 1-0 defeat at Gombe United on Sunday. The former Enyimba coach said they should have grabbed at least a draw from the thrilling encounter at the Pantami Stadium, Gombe. “Defeat is one of those things in football. There are three results: win, draw or loss, unfortunately we got the bad one, a loss. “But we all know from the game that we didn’t deserve to lose but that’s football, sometimes you play well and yet you loss.” He added that his team had learnt their lessons from the defeat, which ended the Sky Blue Stars 11-game unbeaten run in the topflight. “We will take the positives from the game to comeback to winning ways in their subsequent matches,” he added.
