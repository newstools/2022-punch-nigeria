The Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Dr Obafemi Hamzat, has announced his plan to build an Information Communication Technology centre for his alma-mater, Odu Abore Memorial Primary School, Mushin. Hamzat said this, according to a statement on Sunday, during the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the school. He said, “I intend to build an ICT centre in this school because that is what made me what I have become in life today. Building this centre in the school will be a good one and I hope the school will take good care of it and maximise its potential. “It is our responsibility to take care of the children and this we must do very well and also tell them that there is no shortcut to success in life, rather they should be hardworking and always put in their best in whatever they do.” The Commissioner for Education, Mrs Folashade Adefisayo, commended the government for their contribution to quality education in the state. “I want to commend Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his deputy, Dr Kadri Obafemi Hamzat, for their genuine commitment to quality and qualitative education in the state. Parents also need to be more responsible in taking care of their children to guarantee them a better future,” she said.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
