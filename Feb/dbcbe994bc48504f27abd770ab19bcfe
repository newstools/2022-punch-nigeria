Paul Pogba makes his first appearance in three months as Manchester United welcome Middlesbrough in the FA Cup fourth round. The 28-year-old returns from a thigh injury in the encounter at Old Trafford, where goalkeeper Dean Henderson makes his third start of the season. Hannibal Mejbri, 19, is named among the substitutes against a Middlesbrough side which includes former United player Paddy McNair. On-loan Arsenal striker Folarin Balogun is also in line for his first start. Riley McGree tested positive for Covid-19 while on international duty for Australia so his Middlesbrough debut is delayed, according to Skysports. Sammy Ameobi, Darnell Fisher and Marc Bola remain on the sidelines for Chris Wilder’s side. Ralf Rangnick had said Manchester United attacker Jesse Lingard is unavailable for Friday’s FA Cup fourth-round tie against Middlesbrough so he can “clear up his mind”, but the 29-year-old says his “headspace is clear”. Mason Greenwood, who was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of the rape and assault of a woman, has been released on bail pending further investigation and remains suspended by United. Edinson Cavani will not feature due to his recent involvement for Uruguay, while Victor Lindelof (illness) and Eric Bailly (ankle) remain out. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
