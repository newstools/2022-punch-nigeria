The Indigenous People of Biafra has alleged that the Federal Government is detaining its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, because he refused to accept property and monetary inducement offered him to abandon the struggle for Biafra liberation. The group accused the Federal Government of resorting to holding  Kanu indefinitely in order to infiltrate its ranks. IPOB made these remarks in a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, on Monday. According to the group, the Federal Government is also relying on the promise by United States and Europe that they would assist it realise the plot, adding that the promise was made during their secret visit to Aso Rock in December. It said, “We are also aware that the Federal Government has been lobbying the international community to enlist their support against Biafra liberation but they won’t succeed. “Therefore, anybody distracting or causing division in the IPOB family is a tool knowingly or unknowingly working for the Federal Government of Nigeria. ‘The fact remains that Biafra is a divine project. It has gone beyond any single individual, including our leader. Millions of the oppressed Biafran youths, home and abroad, are now more aware and conscious than ever. It’s only a matter of time. Biafra must come. It can only be delayed but certainly not suppressed. “Our leader, Nnamdi Kanu, must be released unconditionally. So, the Federal Government won’t achieve its aim because our leader and IPOB members committed no crime known to law both locally and internationally. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
