Mr. Abiodun Agboola, the Publicity Secretary of a faction in Osun state chapter of the All Progressives Congress backed by the Interior Minister, Rauf Aregbesola, has alleged irregularities in the Saturday’s governorship primary of the party. Agboola, who condemned conduct of the election, said the exercise was planned to favour Osun state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola. A statement signed by Agboola, further read in parts, “Verified information from the agents of Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, our governorship aspirant, has it that there is no record and result sheets in any of the 332 wards of the state. “Also, there were no proper accreditation in majority of the ward collation centres where voting was taken place. The accreditation done in some places were skewed in favour of Governor Gboyega Oyetola as members of the group were allowed to pass through accreditation process without much ado. “Names of sizeable number of members of the APC who wanted to vote for Adeoti were missing in the register of the party. This we had envisaged by calling for the display of party register before the conduct of the primary.” He also alleged that Oyetola’s appointees were used as Collation Officers for the excercise, claiming that the development made manipulation of the election easy.
