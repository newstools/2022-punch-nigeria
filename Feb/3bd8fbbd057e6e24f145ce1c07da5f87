All Progressives Congress chieftain, Joe Igbokwe, has described former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, and wife, Senator Remi Tinubu, as the incoming first family. In a post on his official Facebook page, Igbokwe said Abuja, which is the seat of power in Nigeria, must not be allowed to miss Tinubu and his wife. “We will not allow Abuja to miss these two great leaders. The incoming first family,” he captioned a photo of the couple together. Igbokwe said this just weeks after Tinubu declared interest to contest in the 2023 presidential election. The PUNCH reported that the APC chieftain made the announcement while addressing State House correspondents after a visit to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in Abuja. He had since been going on consultation tours part of which included a visit to London. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
