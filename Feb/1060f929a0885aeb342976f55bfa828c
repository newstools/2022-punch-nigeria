The Yaba College of Technology has emerged best polytechnic in Nigeria for the third consecutive time in the Webometrics ranking released in January 2022. The Deputy Registrar, YABATECH, Mr Joe Ejiofor, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Monday in Lagos. Ejiofor attributed the success to the institution’s improvement in web content and researchable academic papers. He noted that the primary objective of the ranking web was to promote open access to the knowledge generated by institutions. “This is a ranking of higher institutions of learning, it uses both Webometric and Bibliometric (research) indicators and the primary objective is to promote open access to the knowledge generated by institutions.” “This achievement was made possible with the support of the college management led by the charismatic and visionary rector, Mr Obafemi Omokungbe, and academic staff who continuously on daily basis produce quality academic papers for publication. “We post our papers and quality contents on our web and this has been attracting people who are doing research, as they click on our website, it counts for us. “We were ranked eighth position before Omokungbe assumed office and he promised to make YABATECH number one. “In January and June 2021, we emerged number one and we are here again in January 2022,” he said. Ejiofor added that the ranking was aimed at offering full coverage of higher institutions in whatever country or discipline involved. He listed the staff of the Centre for Information Technology and Management (CITM) and students of the institution as other contributors who toiled day and night to ensure that the college maintained the number one position. NAN reports that the ranking web which started in 2004 was currently in its 19th year of publication. (NAN)
