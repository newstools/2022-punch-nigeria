Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said the outcome of the Peoples Democratic Party presidential primary election will shock Nigerians. He said whoever emerges of all the aspirants should be assured that the entire party will rally round and make sure that he wins the 2023 presidential election. Wike, while speaking in Port Harcourt on Sunday, said the comment by former Vice President Atiku Abubakar that he will always clinch the party’s ticket could amount to taking convention delegates for granted. This was contained in a statement by the governor’s Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri. “I didn’t expect him (Atiku), frankly speaking, to say that he will always take the ticket of the party. “That is going too far and taking the delegates for granted,” Wike was quoted as saying. The governor said he was committed to doing anything that will ensure that the PDP returns to power in 2023, and begin once again the process of rebuilding the nation after years of the All Progressives Congress’ poor governance. He urged members of the PDP to resist making divisive utterances, saying the outcome of the party’s presidential election will shock many. “People should watch, there will be shock as far as the PDP convention is concerned. “People should watch what is going to happen. People like to underrate so many persons and it is not good in politics,” he added. Speaking on the timetable just released by the Independent National Electoral Committee, Wike expressed confidence that the National Executive Committee of the PDP will ensure the party abides by the timetable.
