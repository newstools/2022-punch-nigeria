Ukraine has been hit by a ‘massive’ cyberattack targeting government facilities and banks. This is happening just hours after a nationwide state of emergency was declared in preparation for a feared Russian invasion. Based on reports, the websites of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Security Service, and Cabinet of Ministers were all out of action Wednesday afternoon. Deputy Prime Minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, said banks were also targeted in a ‘massive’ distributed denial of service attack, which uses computer networks to bombard websites with information until they crash. Meanwhile, analysts had warned that it would likely be the first stage of a Russian attack. It came just hours after the whole country was placed on a war footing: A state of emergency was declared, 200,000 military reservists called up, border zones were restricted and three million Ukrainians told to leave Russia, with Kiev acknowledging for the first time that an attack could now take place anywhere, at any time. As the noose tightened, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to send more weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against what the US has warned will be an all-out Russian assault. Johnson also promised more and tougher sanctions against Russia if Putin escalates further. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
