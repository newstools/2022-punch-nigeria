The Lagos State Government, through the state Ministry of Transport, has urged Lagosians to always demand tickets from officer of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority when arrested. The Assistant Director, Ministry of Transport, Olayinka Olawole, who said this in a chat with newsmen in Lagos, advised commuters to always obey traffic rules. “Let us obey the rules; there are lots of petitions on the gridlock. When they tow your vehicle to any LASTMA yard, you have the right to demand tickets. Whatever fine they give to you, you can still tender it for redress; we have a department that handles that,” he said. Explaining why LASTMA officials collected money from motorists to tow broken-down vehicles on the road, he said, “You will also know that all these towing vehicles they are using are privately owned. “The other money you have to pay, you will do that to the government coffers; don’t pay to any individual. If you are arrested wrongly, you have the right to come to the state government. Always demand tickets if anybody impounds your trucks.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
