Globally renowned Barbadian singer, Robyn ‘Rihanna’ Fenty, has revealed that hiding her pregnancy from her close friends was harder than she expected. News of her pregnancy broke the internet on Monday, January 31st, 2022, when photos of the singer’s lover, A$AP Rocky, and Rihanna showcasing her baby bump emerged. The duo was photographed in Harlem as Rihanna displayed her baby bump in loved-up photos with her lover, who is also an American rapper. The singer, in an interview with E! News, published on Saturday, revealed that it was hard for her to hide her pregnancy from her close friends. “It was harder for me to keep it from my posse, because they’re around me, they know my habits,” she said. Rihanna continued, “They’re like, ‘You don’t want something to drink? You’re not smoking?’ And I’m eating all the things I’m not used to eating. They know I hate sweets and I’m all of a sudden asking for cookies and donuts. But finally, I just had to let it all out, and they were all shocked, of course, as the world was shocked as well.” The singer also revealed that she felt reluctant to celebrate after learning that she was pregnant because it felt surreal. She said, “When I first found out, it’s not real, you know? I was like, ‘This is not for real, right?’ “And then, it was and it’s almost like you don’t want to get too excited too soon because it’s great news, but you…want to see that it’s going to see its way through. And I’m so glad that we’re this far along and now I can celebrate with everyone.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
