Lawal Liman, the chairman of the faction of the All Progressives Congress in Zamfara State loyal to former Governor Abdulaziz Yari, has condemned the national leadership of the party for issuing certificate of return to Governor Bello Matawalle’s faction of the party despite a court order that status quo be maintained. In a statement on Sunday, Liman described the action as contempt of court by the national organ of the party. He added that, as founding leaders and members of the APC, members of Yari’s faction should not be treated as lepers in their own house. “As a matter of justice, equity and fair play, the National Caretaker Committee of the APC should have stopped action on Zamfara State’s issue until the court case is settled,” he said. Liman added that recent development in the party has further confirmed the fears of its many faithful members across Nigeria that all was not well with the National Caretaker Committee. He added, “As law-abiding citizens of the nation, members of former Governor Abdulaziz Yari faction will remain determined, focused and confident while awaiting the outcome of the court case.”  Copyright PUNCH.
