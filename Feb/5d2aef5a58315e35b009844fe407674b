Paxful, a peer-to-peer fintech platform, has said it is committed to investing in initiatives that support financial inclusion and education in its bid to bridge the financial exclusion gap in the nation. The firm disclosed this at an event titled, ‘Women and The Future of Finance’. It added that financial inclusion is a key to the economic success of a country. According to it, access to financial services empowers individuals with the ability to make decisions that will improve their quality of life. In a statement, the firm said, “In Africa, approximately 70 per cent of women are financially excluded.  Given the large number of female business owners across the continent, the lack of access to financial education among women limits their ability to maximize their full potential. “Specifically, in both Nigeria and Ghana, the number of female entrepreneurs exceeds that of men. By bridging the financial gap, women can make better decisions that will not only affect their own livelihood, but that of the overall economy.” Vice President of Growth at Paxful, Jean Ng, said, “At Paxful, our mission is to bring financial inclusion to the unbanked and build a fair marketplace that gives equal opportunity. “Hosting educational initiatives like ‘Women and the Future of Finance’ provides us with the opportunity to help women overcome traditional financial barriers and put the power back into their own hands.” Copyright PUNCH.
