A presidential aspirant, Mr Chukwuka Monye, has said Nigerians need a leader that will positively impact their lives come 2023. Monye, who is a presidential hopeful under an independent party platform, made the remark while answering questions from newsmen in Kano on Saturday. “What Nigerians need now is impactful leadership. Nigerians are also searching for a competent, vibrant, and energetic leader who can impact positively on their lives,” he said. The presidential hopeful, who said he was in Kano on a humanitarian mission, expressed hope that the current issue of security challenges is taken more seriously. He noted that for the country to move forward, leaders must provide the youth with a platform for expressing themselves. He said, ”I am in Kano State for the second time in my life and this time around to play the role of a father who has a deep concern on the gory tale of a “Nigerian ownership” Hanifa Abubakar of blessed memory who lost her life in a strange way through her teacher who cut her life short by kidnapping her and later poisoned her to death.” Monye also paid a courtesy visit to the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, and informed him of his plan to contest for the exalted seat.
