Unidentified arsonists, on Tuesday, set ablaze the palace of the Osuivie of the Agbarho Kingdom in the Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State. It was gathered that the main hall, a guesthouse, a staff quarter that houses National Youth Service Corps members and the window of the traditional ruler’s apartment inside the palace were among the areas torched in the early morning incident. There were also attempts to set the car of the Osuivie ablaze as petrol was sprayed on different parts of the palace. The palace guard, Mr Friday Sabulefe, was quoted to have said that the arsonists, numbering three, broke into the palace, held him down and issued threats to him at gunpoint. Reacting to the incident, President-General, Agbarho-Urhobo Improvement Union, Chief Monday Igho-Odiphri, told our correspondent that it was the handiwork of those intending to sabotage the progress of the kingdom. He described the incident as a calculated attempt to embarrass the people of the kingdom. Igho-Odiphri said, “I received a distress call around 3am on Tuesday that the palace was being consumed by fire. “We immediately mobilised security men to the palace and their efforts helped in extinguishing the fire. We thank God that no life was lost to the incident.” Igho-Odiphri said security men inspected the level of damage and the escape route of the arsonists. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Bright Edafe, confirmed the incident and said the police had commenced investigation into the matter. “Yes, it is true; investigation has already commenced to bring the perpetrators to justice,” he said.
