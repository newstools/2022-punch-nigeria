The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), is currently meeting with the governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress at the Presidential Villa in Abuja. The meeting was initially scheduled for last Tuesday but it was put off shortly before Buhari’s trip to Brussels and Belgium, to attend the EU-AU Summit. The Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, had confirmed the rescheduled meeting on Sunday, saying it was at the instance of the President. Tuesday’s meeting is expected to discuss the postponement of the party’s convention earlier slated for February 26 2022. The APC Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee had on Monday postponed the party’s national convention for one month, from February 26 to March 26. It also released a new timetable and schedule of activities for the National Convention and Zonal Congresses on Monday. There are also strong indications that the convention may be rescheduled after the meeting with Buhari. Details shortly… Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
