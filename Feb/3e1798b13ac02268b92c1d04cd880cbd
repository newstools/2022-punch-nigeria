A critic of the Kano State Governor, Muazu Magaji, has shifted loyalty to a faction of the All Progressives Congress led by Senator Ibrahim Shekarau. The embattled critic joined the APC faction shortly after he was granted bail by a court in Kano. Magaji was arrested and detained for his alleged defamation of the state governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, on social media. He was released on bail on Saturday after spending one week in a correctional centre, following his failure to fulfill his bail conditions. Meanwhile, at a press conference held at Shekarau’s country home on Sunday, Dansarauniya disclosed that he has formally shifted his loyalty to the Shekarau-led APC faction, adding that the faction means well for the state. He said, “I have now and always been with Ibrahim Shekarau’s G-7 Group and we will continue to do what is right for the betterment of youths in Kano. “Our position has always been just and direct for the good of Kano, and nothing will make us change that position, and knowing full well that Ibrahim Shekarau means well for Kano today, I restate my loyalty to him and his course.” Dansarauniya said that as a law-abiding citizen, he would not comment on his case.
