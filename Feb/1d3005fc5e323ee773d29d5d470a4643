Nasarawa state governor, Abdullahi Sule, has directed the State’s Teachers Service Commission to ensure that the ongoing recruitment exercise of 550 Teachers is devoid of any form of corruption. The governor who spoke through his Chief Press Secretary, Ibrahim Addra, in Lafia on Wednesday after a meeting with the Chairman and commissioners of the Teachers Service Commission, said the recruitment of the 550 teachers must reflect a fair distribution in order to ensure that every constituency in the state is represented. He said that the meeting became necessary because he got information that some unscrupulous individuals were extorting money from applicants with the promise of offering them employment, noting that the recruitment exercise is free of charge. Sule added that only competent and qualified persons should be considered for employment in the recruitment exercise, saying that “putting unqualified persons in teaching positions will amount to incalculable damage to the future of our children and generations come”. He said, “We need qualified and competent prospective teachers in each LGA of the state and so the recruitment of 550 teachers must reflect a fair distribution so that every constituency is represented. Due process must be followed at every stage of the exercise and only the best should be considered. “One of the ways we intend to achieve qualitative education is to completely insulate our teacher recruitment process from political sentiments and undue interference and If the TSC is found guilty of unfairness, the exercise will not be accepted”.
