The Christian Association of Nigeria, on Monday, said it was mobilising the electorate ahead of the 2023 general polls to determine those who would emerge political leaders in the country. Rt. Rev. Stephen Adegbite, Chairman, Lagos State Chapter of CAN, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on the sideline of the media parley to announce the 2022 Inter-Denominational Divine Service. He said that such voter education and mobilisation were essential to deepen democratic culture in the polity, pointing out that it would foster peace, harmony, and economic growth of the nation. Adegbeti, who decried the rate of economic hardship in the country, its attendant insecurity, and despondency, said the era of imposition of incompetent rulers on the people was over. He said that CAN, as one of the leading voices of the people, has started mobilising the electorate through the ongoing voters’ card registration exercise ahead of the elections. “Our local government area officials are in the field to sensitise people on the need to update their voter cards in order to participate in the elections that would give the country better leaders come 2023. “At the moment, the project is mobilisation for voter registration. “After this, the mobilisation will change to participation, choice of candidate to vote for, and securing of votes after the election to ensure that the people votes count. “This is a democratic system and we must be part of the process that brings leaders over us and not rulers. “The period of cabals forcing rulers on the people has passed. “As a people, we need to seize the opportunity of periodic transition offered by the democratic system of governance to improve on our individual and national lives by electing competent leaders of our choice,” he said.
