Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh, has gifted her son, Andre, a piece of land in Scotland as the latter turned six on Thursday. The mother-of-one took to her Instagram page to share the proof of land ownership which she purchased in her son’s name on Sunday, February 13, 2022. In the caption, the actress wrote, “Planning your future has been the most important event for me. For this year, I got my baby @kingandre_dikeh a piece of Scotland’s real estate and his deeds came with a title as ‘LORD’ and a tree planted in his honour and name. I am so proud of how far we have come as a team.” She also appreciated veteran American rapper, Snoop Dogg, for helping her secure the investment. “A big thanks to my girl @glogeworld and my uncle @snoopdogg for helping me get this lifetime real estate investment,” she wrote.

I am proud of your growth. I am proud of our love and partnership. “May the universe bless you beyond our dreams. To say I love you is an understatement. I am dangerously in love with your existence. The one who hurts you should be ready to lose it all. “This is how far I will go for my Love for you! I am not ashamed to prove this love in the highest mountain. Thank you for choosing me! Blessings are yours, my son.” Dikeh welcomed Andre with her ex-husband, Olakunle Churchill, in 2016, a year before their divorce. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
