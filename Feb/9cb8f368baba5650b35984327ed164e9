Nollywood actress, Sharon Ooja, has revealed that she won’t publicise her man on social media due to the messy break up drama between American celebrity couple, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. Since the reality TV star, Kardashian, filed for divorce in February 2021, Kanye West has been involved in several altercations on social media, where he heaped fresh allegations against his estranged wife. On her Snapchat story on Monday, Ooja compared the Wests to another American celebrity couple, Jay-Z and Beyonce, who had kept their private life out of social media. “After seeing Kanye West and Kim’s drama, I sincerely now understand why Jay-Z and Beyonce keep everything about themselves off social media,” Ooja wrote. According to her, she’d not publicise her man because she believed there was no need to seek validation from the world. Ooja continued, “I’ve never been a fan of social media PDA (public display of affection). I’ve always believed that if you are that happy, you don’t need to prove a point to the world. “Do you in peace and be happy genuinely because the same people who hail you for doing the most will be the first to throw stones once it crashes. “What people don’t know, they can’t hate on. And this Kim and Kanye saga just proved all of this! So damn messy. “Social media is just the actual worst. If not for my work, I know for a fact I’d have been one of the people who won’t be on social media…respectfully. “You don’t know who is real and who is clout chasing. Even a whole Kanye West, this saga will put him in trouble. “Facts remain, for me, no matter how excited I am I’m not publicising my man! Nope! Except for my husband.” Copyright PUNCH.
