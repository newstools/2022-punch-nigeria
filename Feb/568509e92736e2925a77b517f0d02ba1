In this episode of So This Happened, we reviewed the story of Zamfara commissioner, Abubakar Abdullahi, who sponsored the wedding for 20 orphans and also empowered 600 youths and women across the 11 wards of Tsafe Local Government Area of the state. Another story that made a buzz this week is the sale of adulterated fuel in Nigeria. The Federal Government through the Nigerian Mainstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority has confirmed that adulterated fuel was discovered in the supply chain. Lastly, a 24-year-old naval candidate has died and another hospitalised in California after completing a punishing test at the conclusion of an assessment period known as Hell Week. Copyright PUNCH.
