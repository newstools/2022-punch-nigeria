Olakunle Churchill, the former husband of Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh, has celebrated their son, Andre, who clocked six on Thursday. Sharing a picture of the celebrant on his Instagram page, Churchill wrote, “Happy birthday to my wonderful son. King Andre Omodayo Oladunni Churchill. God has a perfect plan for you. Grow in wisdom and understanding. Daddy loves you.” Tonto Dikeh, however, in her birthday wish, wrote her child’s name together with her own surname, Dikeh, which was also visible on the child’s Instagram handle. Celebrating her son, the actress had revealed that she acquired a piece of land for him in Scotland, and the land documents also had the name ‘Lord King Andre Dikeh.’ In her birthday wish to her son, Tonto Dikeh wrote, “A king and more. My heart, my soul, my reality check. I am proud of you. I am proud of your growth. I am proud of our love and partnership. “May the universe bless you beyond our dreams. To say I love you is an understatement. I am dangerously in love with your existence. The one who hurts you should be ready to lose it all. “This is how far I will go for my Love for you! I am not ashamed to prove this love in the highest mountain. Thank you for choosing me! Blessings are yours, my son.” Dikeh welcomed Andre with her ex-husband, Churchill, in 2016, a year before their divorce. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
