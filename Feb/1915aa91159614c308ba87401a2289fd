The National Executives Committee of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has set up a committee to lobby “critical stakeholders” across the country to support the South East to produce the president of Nigeria in 2023. The committee called Political Action Committee is to be chaired by President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, George Obiozor, while the Secretary-General, Okey Emuchay, will serve as the secretary. Obiozor, who disclosed this while addressing journalists shortly after the Ohanaeze NEC meeting in Enugu on Thursday, said the job of the committee was to recognise all the “critical stakeholders” in the election and persuade them to support South-East to produce the president for equity, justice, and fairness. He said, “This committee is a persuasion team. They will recognise those that are critical in the election from different parts of Nigeria and within our own group (South-East) because there may be those who are critical here but they don’t want to participate for one reason or the other. “So we’ll encourage, persuade them. But we are none partisan, none political.” Speaking on the present state of Nigeria, the president-general said after about 62 years of nationhood, Nigerians need introspective and retrospective thinking. He however warned that ethno-regional nationalism is growing astronomically, arguing that it was time to rebuild and restore Nigerian nationalism and national spirit. Copyright PUNCH.
