Former Super Falcons forward, Stella Mbachu, has warned the women’s national team against complacency ahead of their 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations second leg qualifier against Ivory Coast. The second leg fixture is scheduled for the Stade Robert Champroux in Abidjan on Wednesday. A brace by US-based forward Ifeoma Onumonu helped the nine-time African champions edge the Lady Elephants 2-0 in the first leg played at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja on Friday to put one leg into the 12th WAFCON finals in Morocco. Speaking with The PUNCH, Mbachu said she was confident the Falcons would qualify for the tournament in Morocco, but urged the ladies to guard against complacency. She said, “I know a lot of people would be worried because the Lady Elephants defeated Niger 20-0 but this is Nigeria we are talking about, we are not in the same class with Niger. “But the girls will need to guard against complacency and play according to the coach’s instructions and plans. They must stay 100 per cent focused and be determined that they can do it away from home. The most important thing for me is that they must not get carried away by their first-leg win.” A draw would see the Falcons book a place at the WAFCON in Morocco, from where Africa’s representatives at next year’s Women’s World Cup would emerge.
