Igbifa lauded Diri for his commitment to the development and progress of Bayelsa and the Ijaw nation, describing his leadership style as credible. He said, “We have decided to confer on you the Grand Ambassador of IYC for your outstanding and credible leadership style. You have shown love and commitment to develop the Ijaw nation. “You have also worked for the unity of this nation beyond party lines and that is why we are calling on all politicians in Ijaw land to close ranks and work in unity despite their party affiliations for the progress of the Ijaw nation. “They need to join you to spread the love because we must put a winnable plan in motion to achieve a prosperous nation”. Receiving the award, Diri thanked Igbifa for the recognition and commended him for changing the narratives in IYC. He described the letter of credence as a strategic gesture and a huge encouragement for him to do more. The governor said, “This goes to show that the only way for the Ijaw nation is progress and that the face of the Ijaw nation is up again. This is the first of credence written by a renowned youth organisation in recent times.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
