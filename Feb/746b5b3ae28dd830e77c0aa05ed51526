Men of the Federal Capital Territory Police Command have visited Mab Global Estate in the Gwarinpa area of Abuja said to have been invaded by suspected Internet fraudsters, aka Yaboo boys. PUNCH Metro had reported that the suspects, numbering about 40, invaded the estate on Saturday. They were said to be dressed in white and after their first attempt to enter the estate was resisted, they returned in a convoy.  They were also refused entry. A resident on the estate told our correspondent on Tuesday that the occupant of the plot mentioned by the suspects as their place of interest was taken away for interrogation on Monday. The source said, “The police came yesterday (Monday) immediately you left the estate. They came to find out what really happened that night. The security guards took them round the estate. They requested to speak with the owner of the plot mentioned by the suspected Yahoo boys. They took her away for further interrogation. As I speak to you, she is still in police custody.” The FCT Police Public Relations Officer, DSP, Josephine Adeh, could not be reached for comments as calls to her line were not answered. Also, she had yet to respond to a message sent to her line on the matter as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
