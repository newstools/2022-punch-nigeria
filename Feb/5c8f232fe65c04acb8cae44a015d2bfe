Popular online comedian, Adebamiro Adeyanju, aka Mr Hyenana, has averred that his viral running skit is created to showcase ills in society. In an interview with our correspondent, the skit maker said the purpose of the running skit was to use humor to expose the government to the challenges people face daily. “The purpose of the running skit is to pin-point issues in our society and express the issues that the masses face to the government through humor. “Once they go viral, the Governor will surely see them and do the needful. Luckily for us, Our Governor has listening ears,” My Hyenana said. In the viral skit, Mr Heynana was seen running as he lamented the high cost of living in the Lekki area of Lagos State.
