The Rotary Club of Lagos has unveiled its plans for the year, saying it will empower 300 women with access to microcredit loans. The President of the club, Mr Babawale Agbeyangi, was quoted to have said this during a briefing on the projects executed between 2021 and 2022. He said, “In Rotary, our immediate community is our priority, so what we have done this year is to focus on women and our target for the Rotary year is to give 300 women interest-free loans. 90 per cent of the people who have accessed our micro-credit this year are women. We started this 20 years ago and this year, we doubled the amount of the microcredit-loan. “Wherever you are, as long as you are a woman and you are a trader, Rotary Club of Lagos will support you. Our International President, Shektar Mehta, has said we must focus on women this year, and you know that all over the world, women are generally disadvantaged, so our focus is to help more women wherever.” Agbeyangi added that the club also planned to renovate a health care centre on Lagos Island and provide 10 boreholes for a town in Ogun State. “Other projects in the pipeline include the provision of 10 boreholes at Coker town, Ogun State, which will cost $86,000; reconstruction and renovation of the Sura Primary Healthcare Centre on Lagos Island, which consists of a 10-bed maternity ward, labour room, kitchen, toilets and waiting area. This is expected to cost N50m,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
