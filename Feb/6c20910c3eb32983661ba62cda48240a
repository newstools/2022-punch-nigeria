Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has urged the state-owned football team, Shooting Stars, to maximise their current form by ensuring the club finished the ongoing Nigeria Professional Football League season on top of the log. The Governor made the call when he received a delegation from Shooting Stars Sports Club led by the Team Manager, Dimeji Lawal, according to a post on his Facebook page on Thursday. The Oluyole Warriors have been on impressive form after winning their last three matches both at home and away. The team defeated their last opponent, Heartland FC, 4-0, following the 1-0 away victory over MFM last Sunday. The club’s victory saw them to the sixth position with 15 points from 10 games of the 2021/2022 season. Receiving the Shooting Stars Sports Club led by team manager, Dimeji Lawal, on Thursday, the Governor posted, “The delegation included three new players signed by 3SC, Sunday Faleye, Acreche Sunday and Niyi Adekunle. “I encouraged the team to target the top spot of the Nigeria Professional Football League. “I also commiserated with the team over the sad demise of the General Manager, Rasheed Balogun, last month and pledged to ensure his legacy is upheld. “May his soul rest in peace and may God grant his family and friends the fortitude to bear the irreplaceable loss.” Copyright PUNCH.
