The Independent National Electoral Commission says it plans to review the performance and functionalities of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System during Saturday’s FCT Area Council poll. The FCT INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner, Yahaya Bello, said this when he spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria on Saturday in Abuja. Bello said that the commission had observed challenges faced by voters due to the non-functionality of the BVAS and was working to address them. “Equally, there was also the misunderstanding about what to do with the BVAS. “The election is the only Area Council Election in this country that is being conducted by INEC, and it invested heavily in the preparation for the election. “We have Registration Area Centre Technicians trained in order to respond to any malfunctioning of the BVAS and provided transportation for them for swift response,” he said. Bello stated that six INEC Resident Electoral Commissioners and three National Commissioners were drafted to the election to ensure its success. He said, “We have upcoming elections, so between now and then the issues would be looked into to avoid future challenges.” (NAN)
