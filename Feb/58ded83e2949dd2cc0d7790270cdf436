The United States Mission has announced the expansion of its visa services to assist non-immigrant visa applicants in Nigeria who qualify to renew their visas. “This new application procedure will begin in February at the U.S. Consulate in Lagos and will be extended shortly thereafter to the U.S. Embassy in Abuja. “The number of qualified applicants who can apply using the new procedures will be limited initially,” the mission said in a statement on Tuesday. How to apply for the no-interview visa renewal
You may be eligible for a visa renewal without an interview if your application is for a B1/B2, F, M, J (academic only), H, L or C1/D (combined only) visa, AND you meet each of the following criteria: · Your previous visa was issued in Nigeria;
· Your previous visa is in the same classification as your current application;
· Your previous visa was a full validity, multiple entry visa;
· Your previous visa expired within the last 24 months or will expire in the next 3 months from the date of application;
· You have all your passports covering the entire period since receiving the previous visa and the passport with the most recent visa;
· You have never been arrested or convicted of any crime or offense in the United States, even if you later received a waiver or pardon; and
· You have never worked without authorization or remained beyond your permitted time in the United States. To start application If you are qualified based on the above criteria, visit https://www.ustraveldocs.com/ng to start your application.
