Some yet-to-be-identified gunmen have reportedly killed five persons and injured many after burning vehicles during separate attacks at two polling units at Enugu South and Agbani council areas. The state Independent Electoral Commission held local government elections in the 17 council areas in the state and 260 councillorship wards. Hoodlums caused havoc at the venue even though the election marred by apathy was largely peaceful except in Aninri, Awgu, Nkanu West and Enugu South. Sources told The PUNCH that the gunmen invaded the polling units at Obeagu ward III in Enugu South LGA and another polling unit at Akpugo in Nkanu West LGA, and disrupted the exercise. One of the sources said the hoodlums destroyed electoral materials after chasing away voters. A source, who simply gave his name only as Cyprian Nwobodo said, “About five persons were shot and killed while some people escaped with machete cuts and bullet wounds. They also burnt two vehicles belonging to community members who came to vote. I overheard from hiding the gunmen shouting that they had warned that there should no longer be elections in any part of the South-East.’’ Efforts to get reactions of the state police command failed as the spokesman, Daniel Ndukwe, did not take his calls or respond to messages text to his mobile as of the time of filing this report.
