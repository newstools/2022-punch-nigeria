Residents of Offa in the Offa Local Government Area of Kwara State on Friday stormed the Government House in Ilorin to protest what they described as the delay in the trial of the suspects arrested in connection with the April 5, 2018, armed robbery incident which claimed 33 lives. Recall that 33 persons, including nine policemen, were killed by the armed robbers who invaded some commercial banks in Offa. The armed robbers also reportedly carted away about N10m during the bloody attack. The five suspects in the 2018 Offa bank robbery, Ayoade Akinnibosun, Ibikunle Ogunleye, Adeola Abraham, Azeez Salawu and Niyi Ogundiran are all standing trial before Justice Haleema Salman of the Kwara State High Court in Ilorin. However, the aggrieved residents urged the State Governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, to expedite action on the trial of the suspects to serve the victims and their relations with justice. Some of the inscriptions on the placard carried by the protesters were, “Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, don’t fold your hands. Expedite action on the trial of Offa robbery suspects,” “We need justice on Offa robbery incident” and “The blood of Offa 33 victims is crying,” among others. Addressing the protesters on behalf of the governor, the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Salman Jawondo SAN, said the case was still pending before a court of competent jurisdiction. Jawondo, however, said that no stone would be left unturned until justice was served on the matter.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
