The Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee Monday evening announced that it would conduct the national Convention on March 26, 2022. This is contrary to a letter it sent to the Independent National Electoral Commission on the conduct of zonal congresses. The party said it intends to conduct its zonal congress on March 26, 2022. It also informed the commission that the earlier Convention slated for February 26, 2022, will no longer hold. In the letter signed by the Chairman, APC Caretaker Committee, Mai Mala Buni, and the Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe, the party informed the commission that this new congress would supersede the earlier letter. In the letter dated February 21, 2022, marked APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/22/21, the party said it had to hold a zonal congress first in compliance with its constitution. The letter titled ‘Notice for the Conduct of Zonal Congress’ read in part, “This notice supersedes our earlier notice for a national convention referenced APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/22/14. This is predicated on the evaluation of our party constitution.” On Monday evening, however, the National Secretary of the Party, Dr John Akpanudoedehe, who announced the new development to Correspondents after the closed-door meeting, said the preparation for the National Convention would commence on March 24, 2022, while the zonal congresses will hold before the National Convention slated for March 26, 2022. He said the Committee had been in a closed-door meeting since 11:00 am on Monday. According to him, “After deliberation and agreement with the CECPC, we have agreed and approved that the activities of the national Convention commence from March 24 and terminate on March 26. “The convention activities commence on February 24, and it will terminate at Eagles Square on March 26. In between the Convention, we have agreed to have zonal congresses.” Meanwhile, the APC has updated its schedule of activities ahead of the new date of March 26 for the National Convention. According to the new timetable, the Publication of National Convention Sub-Committees now holds on February 28, 2022. The sale of forms would run from Wednesday, March 9, to Friday, March 11. Applicants will be screened from March 15 – 17, while screening appeals will be held on March 19, 2022. March 21 has been slated for the adoption of the appeal report as the accreditation of participants to the Convention holds from March 24 – 25., The Convention, which is now scheduled for Saturday, March 26, 2022, will be followed by a convention appeal three days later on March 29. The appeal report will be adopted on March 30, after which new party leaders will be inaugurated the next day. Zonal congresses earlier scheduled for March 26 will now hold on March 12.
