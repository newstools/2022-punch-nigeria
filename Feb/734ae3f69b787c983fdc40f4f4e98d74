A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party in Edo State, Kenneth Imasuangbon, has said it was time for the Federal Government to allow states to set up police. Imasuangbon, who was reacting to last week’s bank robberies in Uromi, headquarters of Esan North East, said well-funded state police would allow for intelligence-gathering and possible prevention of crime. He also urged the citizen not to leave the work of policing solely for the police, noting that citizen participation in security would have prevented the crime from being perpetrated. Imasuangbon who spoke from the United State of America also commiserated with victims of the attacks and people of Uromi. He said the coordinated attacks showed that the armed robbers carried out diligent intelligence on the area. He called on locals to always give accurate and timely information to the police whenever they suspect any unholy movement. He said, “From what I saw from the short video clip on robbery in the social media, it was clear that the robbers had a field day. It is time for the citizens to be actively involved in community policing and intelligence gathering. “As citizens, we should take a cue from what is happening in Ukraine where courageous citizens rise up in defence of their country against Russia. “The Edo State government is doing its best to curb insecurity in the state. There is need for all of us to support the state to fight crime because Edo state belongs to all of us. “The horror of the Uromi attacks is a warning to all of us that the time to allow state police is now. We will not allow criminals run us out of our communities as being witnessed in other parts of the country.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
