STRIKER Henry Onyekuru will hope to end his 175-day goals drought when Olympiakos travel to face Atalanta in a Europa League first leg fixture at the Gewiss Stadium in Bergamo on Thursday (today), PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The Nigerian has not scored a goal for Olympiacos in his last 21 games for the club. The 24-year-old, who has made 24 appearances this term — 14 starts and 10 as a substitute — for the reigning Greek champions, last scored in Olympiakos’ 2-2 draw in a Europa League game second leg qualifying round fixture against Slovan Bratislava on August 26, 2021, in Slovakia. The game was his second for the club since he arrived on a permanent deal from AS Monaco last summer. The Greek side will be looking for early goals themselves, after winning their last 12 games in their domestic league while leading at half-time. Confidence should be on the side of the ‘Red-Whites’ too, having lost only one of their 13 matches since their last Europa League group game (winning nine and drawing three), keeping a remarkable nine clean sheets in the process. Whether that form can be transferred to the European stage remains to be seen, as Olympiacos have lost their last three trips to Italy in major European competitions, and therefore will deservedly start as overwhelming underdogs. However, discount them at your peril as Olympiacos have successfully navigated the first knockout round of the Europa League in three of their last four attempts.  Copyright PUNCH.
