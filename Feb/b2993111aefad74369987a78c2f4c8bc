The Baptist Academy Old Students Association ‘84 set given cash prizes to the best students of the 2020/2021 academic session for their performances in the West African Examination Examinations. This is the third year of the annual scholarship. The sum of N100,000 was given to the overall best graduating student, Favour Oni, who also won the best student award of N50,000. The best student in arts, Daniel Odunmosu was awarded N50,000 while Kola Jesse, the best Commercial won N50,000 each. In his remarks, the Chairman of BOSA ’84 set, Mr Akin Dosumu said the essence of the award was to motivate the students and propel them for further success. Dosumu said, “This token goes a long way to support the winners who some of them are in the university. “For the school, we see it as a way of giving back to the school that has contributed to our development physically, academically, spiritually, and professionally. We still remember most of the moral instructions that have been inculcated in us, particularly during the morning assembly. Aside from the awards, we have taken up some projects in the school. We realise that we cannot afford to leave everything to the government or the Baptist Missions.” For his part, the Principal of the school, Mr Gbenga Abodunrin said the award was a fraction of the awards given to deserving students. He urged students at every level not to get discouraged when they do their best and were not recognised for it. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
