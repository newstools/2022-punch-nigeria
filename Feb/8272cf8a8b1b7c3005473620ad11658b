Gunmen have killed a soldier at the boundary between Uburu and Mpu communities of Ebonyi and Enugu States. Investigations revealed that the incident, which took place on Wednesday, caused panic in the affected areas. A community source said residents were seen leaving the area out of fear of being attacked. Security operatives were said to have mounted a checkpoint in the area, thereby causing traffic jam. The Ebonyi State Government, on Thursday, confirmed the incident. Briefing journalists after the State Security Council meeting, the state Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Uchenna Orji, said, “A security report was received on the killing of one security personnel on duty in the boundary between Uburu in Ebonyi State and Mpu in Enugu State by yet-to-be identified gunmen and the State Executive Council condemned the attack and urged security agencies to intensify efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice.” He added, “Council noted the renewed hostilities in Abaomege/Isinkwo/Ukawu communities over their disputed land and directed stakeholders from the area to work closely with security agencies with a view to identifying those responsible for the renewed attack despite the resolutions made on the disputed land by the state government.”  Copyright PUNCH.
