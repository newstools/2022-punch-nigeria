The Super Falcons will fly out of Nigeria on Sunday (tomorrow) ahead of their 2022 Women Africa Cup of Nations second leg qualifier against Ivory Coast without their captain Asisat Oshoala, Saturday PUNCH reports. The second leg fixture is scheduled for the Stade Robert Champroux in Abidjan on Wednesday. The Barcelona Femini forward missed the first leg fixture due to a hamstring injury she suffered while running on the eve of the game against Ivory Coast. “Oshoala won’t feature in the second leg against Ivory Coast as she is injured and may be out for another two months,” a source close to the player told Saturday PUNCH. This comes after her depressive post on Twitter on Friday. In the now-deleted tweet, Oshoala wrote, “life is just unfair…. tired of trying.” Nine-time champions Nigeria put one leg into the 12th Africa Women’s Cup of Nations finals in Morocco when they defeated Ivory Coast 2-0 at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja on Friday. A brace by US-based forward Ifeoma Onumonu took the Falcons above the visitors in the two-match fixture, with the winners proceeding to the finals in Morocco, from where Africa’s representatives at next year’s FIFA Women’s World Cup would emerge.
