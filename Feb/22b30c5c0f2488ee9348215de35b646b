THE Rasaq Salinsile-led faction of the All Progressives Congress in Osun State has condemned the alleged midnight arrest of the chairman of the party in Ifelodun Local Government, Siji Alatayo, by the police. The party, in a statement by its Publicity Secretary, Abiodun Agboola, also condemned what it described as the Gestapo-like manner of the arrest of one of its leaders, Siju Oyewumi, in his Eko Ende home in the middle of the night. Agboola noted that the “hunting of the party leaders and members by the police” in Ifelodun Local Government portends great danger to the nation’s fledgling democracy and security. He wondered what could have been the offences of the arrested persons that could warrant their arrest. Agboola said the arrest of the APC leaders might not be unconnected with the federal constituency meeting held on Tuesday, which was disrupted by armed political hoodlums allegedly sent by the Ileri Oluwa faction of the party. He further stated that the thugs attacked members of the party at the meeting with guns, cutlasses and other weapons. The statement read, “Their jaundiced claim was that nobody should express opposing views to the governor’s bid for a second term from the federal constituency, which is undemocratic. “We note that the police’s unconventional method of midnight arrests is inimical to the societal wellbeing and against the rules of policing which is basically to protect lives and property of citizens. “The midnight police arrests are tantamount to promoting the insecurity being experienced in the country as criminals parading the land could hide under such despicable and cave-dwelling manner of policing. “We can decipher political motive in the arrest as the police have not told the world the offences committed by those arrested.”
