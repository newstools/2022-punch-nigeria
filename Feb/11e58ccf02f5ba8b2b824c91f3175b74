Nigeria beat Cameroon 3-0 at the MKO Abiola National Stadium, Abuja on Saturday as they edge closer to the Women’s U-20 World Cup that will be taking place in Costa Rica in August. The Falconets have now reached the final round of the qualification series following an impressive journey so far. The encounter was the first international match at Nigeria’s finest sporting arena since the Falcons defeated their Senegalese counterparts 2-0 in a Women Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match in April 2016. A brace by midfielder Esther Onyenezide and one by Precious Vincent sent the Young Lionesses back to Yaounde without a point. Onyenezide struck after 22 minutes before Vincent increased the worries of the visitors eight minutes from the interval. Onyenezide struck again in the 73rd minute to put the match beyond the Lionesses. The Falconets will now play Senegal in the final round of the qualification phase in a two-legged affair next month for a slot at the World Cup in Costa Rica. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
