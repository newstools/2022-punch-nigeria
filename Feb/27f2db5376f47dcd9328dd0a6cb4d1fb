A National Youth Service Corps member in Rivers State, Chiamaka Enyia, has come to the rescue of an indigent pupil, Grace Kenneth, of Awarra Community Secondary School, Ohaji, Imo State by paying her school and West African Senior School Certificate Examination fees on Thursday. According to the corps member who used her Facebook page to raise funds for Grace Kenneth, the pupil, an indigene of Awarra, Ohaji, who couldn’t sit for her WASSCE last year because of lack of funds, contacted her to help her out this year. Enyia wrote on Facebook, “Weeks ago, I got a message from this young star, requesting assistance on her WASSCE registration as she was unable to write the exam last year because of lack of funds; this was so touching because I was once in her shoes “Today, I and my team members travelled down to Community Secondary School Awarra, Ohaji, to help clear her WASSCE registration fees. “Yes, and she was super excited and promised to do great in her coming exams.” A grateful Grace thanked the corps member for making her dream come true and promised to make the best use of the opportunity given to her.
