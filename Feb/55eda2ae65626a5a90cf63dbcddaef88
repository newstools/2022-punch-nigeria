The All Progressive Congress reconciliatory meeting with the two warring factions in Kano ended in Abuja on Friday with the hope of resolving the lingering crisis. A source at yesterday’s meeting told The PUNCH that the meeting which lasted for about six hours, was attended by Senator Ibrahim Shekarau and Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje. According to the source, both factions had during the meeting presented their demands and gave suggestions on how to address the issue with a view to ensuring amicable resolution of the crisis. The source explained that the National Headquarters of the party had on Friday received briefings and proposals from the two factions after the reconciliation meeting. “The national leadership of the party has promised to study all the proposals presented at the meeting and take a definite stand that will be communicated to the two parties at a meeting to be convened at a later date soon,” the source said. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the absence of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje at the two previous reconciliation meetings stalled the peace process. However, reacting on the issue, the factional Chairman of the APC in Kano state, Abdullahi Abbas said that the absence of Governor Ganduje at the party’s reconciliation meeting in Abuja on Tuesday was not deliberate.
