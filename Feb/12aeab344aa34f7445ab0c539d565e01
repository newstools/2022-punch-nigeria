According to Notizie Milan, Italian giants AC Milan are interested in Nigerian Villarreal forward Samuel Chukwueze and are ready to make a move for him. Chukwueze is no stranger to transfer rumours since the Yellow Submarines grabbed him following a memorable outing for Nigeria at the 2015 U-17 World Cup. The Nigeria international was also a subject of transfer speculations during the 2020 January transfer, with English Premier League sides Chelsea and Liverpool rumoured to be interested in the 22-year-old. Chukwueze suffered a blip in form at the beginning of the season but is gradually returning to his best form. He put on a fine show against Juventus in the Champions League last week, as Villarreal held the Old Lady 1-1 in the first leg of their knockout tie at home. According to the Italian website, Milan are eager to sign the Nigerian and willing to negotiate Villarreal’s €25m valuation for the player. “According to rumours from Spain, Milan have set their sights on Villareal’s Samuel Chukwueze,” the website wrote. “The Nigerian winger has shown great technical and physical qualities and an extraordinary speed. The Yellow Submarines value him between €20m and €25m, a figure that Milan would not reach very easily, but (Paolo) Maldini and Massara could negotiate with the Spaniards to reduce the demands on the African.” Chukwueze has scored five goals and assisted two more in 21 games across all competitions this term.
