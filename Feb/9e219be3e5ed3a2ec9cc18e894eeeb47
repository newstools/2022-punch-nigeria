Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has berated his Cross River State counterpart, Prof Ben Ayade and the police for attempting to thwart the Peoples Democratic Party rally in Calabar on Saturday. Recall that the police had in the earlier hours of Saturday barricaded the Calabar Sports Club, the venue for the flag-off of PDP’s campaigns for Ogoja/Yala Federal Constituency and Akpabuyo state constituency bye elections. Addressing teeming PDP faithful at the venue of the rally in Calabar, Wike described as a disgusting attempt by Ayade and the police to prevent the PDP from holding its rally for the Ogoja/Yala Federal Constituency and  Akpabuyo state constituency bye elections. This was contained in a statement issued by Wike’s media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, and made available to newsmen in Port Harcourt. “When I was told that they didn’t want you to hold this rally, I said this rally must hold today and I must come. Whatever will happen, let it happen today. I told your leader that if you did not hold this rally today, then that would have been the end of PDP. But I thank God, all of you resisted it and you said enough is enough. “I’m going to give you every support. Don’t be afraid. They tried it in Rivers State, we resisted them. They are trying to instigate fear in you. Don’t be afraid at all. Whatever Cross River government can do, PDP can do it better. “I don’t understand how a governor will for ordinary federal constituency election, ordinary state election, stop them to hold rally. When it comes to governorship, what will happen?” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
