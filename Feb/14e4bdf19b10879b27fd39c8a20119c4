There was tension on Thursday as coordinated armed robbery attacks were carried out on some commercial banks in Uromi, headquarters of Esan North-East Local Government Area of Edo State. No fewer than five persons, including policemen, were reportedly killed during the attacks. The Edo State Police Command spokesman, Kontongs Bello, confirmed the robbery attacks but did not give details. The suspected armed robbers were also said to have carted away unspecified huge sums of money from the affected banks. A resident of the sprawling community, the hometown of a late Peoples Democratic Party chieftain, Tony Anenih, said that the attacks on the banks were too coordinated. The source, who pleaded anonymity, described the attacks as “too coordinated in commando style and armed robbers launched the attacks simultaneously. This is novel in this town”. Other sources in the town listed the banks affected by the activities of the suspected armed robbers to include Zenith Bank, First Bank, Unity Bank and the United Bank for Africa. “The sporadic shots by the armed robbers caused panic in the town. The robbers came prepared. People are just running helter-skelter,” another source said. Residents were said to be making contacts with security agencies to come to the rescue of the banks and the residents. Meanwhile, when contacted, the Edo State Police Command Public Relations Office, Kontongs Bello, confirmed the attacks, saying, “That’s true sir”, but did not provide further details.
