The Chairman of Access Bank Plc, Ajoritsedere Awosika, has said the bank’s sponsorship of the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon is in line with its strategic objectives to be positioned as ‘Africa’s gateway to the world’. A statement said Awosika spoke at the recently concluded 7th edition of the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon. “Sport is one of the gateways to Africa and conversely one of Africa’s gateways to the world, hence, the annual Access Bank Lagos City Marathon connects with our strategic objectives to make the continent more attractive to global investors and trade partners,” she said. Speaking on the bank’s long-term plan in relation to the marathon and sports, she said that Access Bank was going global with its efforts and the Access Bank team had been given a target of about five years to achieve the goal. “Access Bank is looking at getting beyond today. It’s already in our strategic plan,” she said. The statement said at the marathon, which returned to its full-scale form, Geleta Ulfata of Ethiopia emerged as the winner of the 42km men’s race. It said Ulfata beat about 300 marathoners on Saturday morning to claim the grand prize of $30,000. He edged out David Barmasai and Emmanuel Naibei, both from Kenya, who finished second and third, respectively and would go home with $20,000 and $15,000. Ethiopia’s Dagne Yirga was the first woman to cross the finish line at two hours 33 minutes and 50 seconds, followed by Alemenseh Guta and Naomi Maiyo, going home with $30,000, $20,000 and $15,000 respectively.
