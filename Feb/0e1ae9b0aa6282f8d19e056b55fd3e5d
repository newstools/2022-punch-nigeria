ESPERANCE Tunis winger Anayo Iwuala has revealed how devastated he was after he was jeered by Tunisians following the Super Eagles defeat to the Carthage Eagles in the round of 16 of the just-concluded Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The former Enyimba player could only watch the Eagles crash out of the AFCON from his base in Tunisia after he was left out by new coach of the team, Austin Eguavoen. Nigeria were the clear favourites before the encounter, following their impressive displays in the group stage, where they won all three games, including a 1-0 triumph over eventual finalists Egypt. Despite their flying start, Eguavoen’s side suffered a shock 1-0 defeat to COVID-19 hit Tunisian side who were without several players heading into the game. Iwuala, who made his debut for Nigeria in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Benin in March 2021 under former Eagles gaffer Gernot Rohr, said he was jeered by fans after the defeat. “The atmosphere in Tunisia after their victory over Nigeria was a bit hard for me because I am a Nigerian and I play for the Eagles,” the winger told PUNCH Sports Extra. “My teammates made jest of me asking me how I felt about my country losing to Tunisia and to be honest I was a little bit hurt. “It was like a blow on my face and a lot of jeers at me. I wished we won that game but credit to Eguavoen and the boys. “Eguavoen did well despite the short time he was in charge to manage the team and I am confident that he will continue to do well with the team.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
