The FCT Minister Team on Monitoring, Inspection and Enforcement on Monday raided hideouts of drug dealers, arresting two. The hideout was located around the Kubwa-Dutse road interchange and cannabis worth 45kg was seized from the suspects. Speaking after the operation, the Senior Special Assistant to FCT Minister on Monitoring, Inspection and Enforcement, Attah Ikharo said the operation was intelligence-driven. He said the arrested suspects have been handed over to the Nigerian Drug Law Enforcement Agency. Attah said, “The ongoing war against crimes and illegalities in the Federal Capital Territory has yielded fruits following the raid of another deadly drug colony where two suspects were arrested and cannabis worth 45kg were seized from them. ”The drug colony was exposed by security intelligence, warranting a marching order from the FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, for its destruction. “The suspects and the seized drugs have been handed over to the operatives of the Nigerian Drug Law Enforcement Agency for further investigation.” He noted that the efforts have been intensified to track down all criminal elements, and everything that constitutes a security threat, through aggressive monitoring of all parts of Abuja.
