The Catholic Bishop of Lafia Diocese in Nasarawa State, David Ajang, has warned politicians in the country to ensure that they deliver the dividends of democracy to the electorate. He also cautioned them to be careful of their utterances to avoid a take-over of government by the military. The Bishop gave the warning on Saturday in Garaku, Kokona Local Government Area during the 10th wedding anniversary of a member of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly, Daniel Ogazi. He attributed incidences of coup in Africa to bad governance, corruption and the neglect of the youth in the scheme of things, saying that politicians should eschew rancour, hate speeches, promotion of religious sentiment and ethnicity to ensure steady growth of the nation. Speaking on peaceful co-existence among couples, Ajang urged Ogazi and his wife to always appreciate the marital institution by loving one another,  showing understanding, and tolerating each other while urging parents to continue to inculcate moral values in their children in order to have a better society.
