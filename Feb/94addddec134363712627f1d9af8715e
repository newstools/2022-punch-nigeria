The Nigerian Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers has said there is no possibility of 5G interference with aircraft operation in the country. According to a statement signed by its outgoing National Chairman, Kings Adeyemi, the NCC’s choice of the 3.5 GHz band is different from the civil aircraft altimeters, which usually operate between 4.2 and 4.4 GHz range. He said, “This decision allays the fear of 5G services interfering with the aircraft operations as currently exercised in some countries. “NCC’s choice on the 3.5 GHz band has sufficiently safeguarded civil aircraft altimeters, which usually operate between 4.2 and 4.4 GHz range.” He commended the commission for the choice of 3.5-3.6 GHz and 3.7-3.8GHz as frequencies in the range 3.3-4.2 GHz (3GPP Band 78) are being used as the basis for the first implementations of 5G globally. Adeyemi said, “From expert’s perspective, the choice of two slots of 100 MHz (TDD) bandwidth each on 3.5 GHz band (precisely 3GPP Band 78) is a highly laudable choice to launch 5G network. “It is technically proven that wider channels lower network density which ripples into lowering the cost of 5G services to consumers. Other advantages include less base stations sites and lower environmental impact. “The 3.5 GHz band is the best choice to balance capacity and network coverage, which in turn encourages operators to commit investment in 5G infrastructure.” According to him, the major requirements for 5G journey include spectrum availability, investor-friendly regulatory policy, and stakeholders’ awareness.
