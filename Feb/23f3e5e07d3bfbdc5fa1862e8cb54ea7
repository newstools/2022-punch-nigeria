Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has denied reports that he plans to declare his intention to run for president ahead of the 2023 elections after the All Progressives Congress Convention slated for February 26, 2021. Earlier on Monday, there were reports that Osinbajo would announce his presidential bid for 2023. However, Senior Special Assistant to the Vice President on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, said the report is false and speculative. He added that any information on the action of the Vice President would come directly from his office and not the press. Laolu tweeted late Monday, “I’ve seen “news” that VP’ll announce presidential bid after APC’s convention. Anyone reading the story‘ll know it’s all false and speculative snippets. “Any information on activities and actions of the VP will come directly from his office and not sponsored speculations in the press.” Copyright PUNCH.
