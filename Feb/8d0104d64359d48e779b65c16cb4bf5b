The All Progressives Congress has written a letter to the Independent National Electoral Commission informing INEC of its intention to conduct its zonal congress on March 26, 2022. The APC further informed the commission that the earlier convention slated for February 26, 2022, may no longer hold. In the letter signed by the Chairman, APC Caretaker Committee, Mai Mala Buni; and the Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe, the party informed the commission that this new congress will supersede the earlier letter. In the letter dated February 21, 2022 marked APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/22/21, the party said it had to hold a zonal congress first in compliance with its constitution. The letter titled, ‘Notice for the Conduct of Zonal Congress’ read in part, “This notice supersedes our earlier notice for a national convention referenced APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/22/14. This is predicated on the evaluation of our party constitution.” The APC has been postponing its national convention since December 2020. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
