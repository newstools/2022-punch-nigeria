Contractors have picketed the Niger Delta Development over the failure of the commission to pay for the services rendered to it. The contractors, under aegis of NDDC Indigenous Contractors Association, had in the past six days taken over the premises of the NDDC in protest. The contractors, who carried placards with inscriptions such as ‘NDDC pay us our money,’ ‘NDDC, Akwa pay contractors please,’ ‘NDDC contractors are dying,’ said all attempts to get their money had proven abortive. The President of the association, Andrew Ijegbai, lamented that the contractors, for over five years, had not been paid for the services they rendered to the commission. Ijegbai said it was painful that the contractor used their money to execute the projects, which had been inaugurated and put to use. He said, “We are here because we have done jobs for NDDC for the past four years; we have been waiting for our payment, but they are giving us all kinds of excuses. “As it stands now we can no longer afford our children’s school fees. We collected most of the money from financial institutions and we used our houses as collateral; now the banks are now collecting our houses. We have pleaded, we have gone to Abuja, but to no avail.” He called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to intervene to compel the NDDC to pay them. Copyright PUNCH.
