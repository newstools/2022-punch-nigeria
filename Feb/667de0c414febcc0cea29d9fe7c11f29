The House of Representatives, on Thursday, resolved to constitute an ad hoc committee to “investigate the collapse of automobile assembly plants in the country, with a view to making insightful recommendations for the immediate resuscitation of the plants.” The resolution was sequel to the unanimous adoption of the motion moved by a member of the House, Abdullahi Halims. Moving the motion titled ‘Need to Revive the Moribund Automobile Assembly Plants in Nigeria,’ Halims noted the socio-economic benefits of automobile industries in a developing country like Nigeria as “enormous and cannot be over-emphasised.” The lawmaker stated that it would drastically reduce unemployment, thus reducing insecurity resulting from joblessness. Halims recalled that in the 70s up till the early 90s, automobile companies like Volkswagen, Peugeot, Leyland, ANAMCO, etc., had functional assembly plants located in different cities across the country and contributed positively to the economy. He said, “The House is cognisant that the current economic challenges facing Nigeria as a whole are majorly unemployment and insecurity. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
