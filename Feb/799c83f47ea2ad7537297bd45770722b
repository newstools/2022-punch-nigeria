The statement clarified that only vigilante groups whose members operate under the command of the police would be recognided by the state government. The statement was titled,’Banning of the activities of Yan sa kai volunteer group across Katsina State’. It read, “The Katsina State Government has banned the activities of Yan Sa Kai due to the overzealous criminal activities of the Volunteer (Yan Sa Kai) group in the State, which always resulted in extrajudicial killings of innocent persons and looting their property. “Katsina State Government only recognises the activities of Vigilante Group which is under the supervision, control and monitoring of the Police, other Security Agencies and Traditional Institutions. “Henceforth, arrested suspects should be handed over to the Police or any Security Agency for proper investigation and action where necessary.
