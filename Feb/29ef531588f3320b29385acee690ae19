The Osun State Police Command on Saturday said a suspect arrested at the scene of last Thursday’s attack on the campaign office of a former state governor, Rauf Aregbesola, in Osogbo was still in its custody. The command spokesperson, Yemisi Opalola, during an interview with our correspondent, explained that the suspect was undergoing interrogation by policemen. It would be recalled that Oranmiyan House that was used as an office by Aregbesola and his group in Osun APC came under attack by some hoodlums who shot at the building and a transformer stationed in front of it. But Opalola, who assured that the command would ensure that the perpetrators of the crime did not escape justice, also called for timely information from members of the public. She said, “We are after the perpetrators of the act. We assure members of the public that no criminal will escape justice. The suspect that was picked up at the scene of the crime is still in our custody.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
