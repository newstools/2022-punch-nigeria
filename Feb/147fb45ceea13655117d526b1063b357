Suspected hoodlums late Friday vandalised a Toyota Hiace bus belonging to an agency of the Osun State Government, the Rural and Water Sanitation Agency. The attackers, it was learnt, had chased and caught up with the bus said to be heading towards Osogbo a few meters away from the Zone XI Police Command Headquarters. A video of the incident obtained by our correspondent showed that the rear  glass of the vehicle, as well as side glass, were smashed by the attackers. The identities of the occupants of the bus were not also revealed in the 39 seconds video. The bus with the number plate 52C-09 OS, also had an inscription www.ruwesa.osun.gov.ng.
