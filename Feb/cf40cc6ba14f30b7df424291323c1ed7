A 37-year-old woman, Blessing Njoku, has been arraigned before an Ebute Metta Magistrate’s Court, Lagos State, for allegedly obtaining palm oil valued at N505,000  from a trader, Okafor Chinazor, under false pretences. PUNCH Metro gathered that Njoku, sometime in November 2021, bought the oil from Okafor and promised to pay for the good before the end of the month. She, however, allegedly reneged on the agreement and resorted to violence when Okafor demanded his money. She was arraigned on Thursday on three counts bordering on obtaining under false pretences, stealing, and conduct likely to cause breach of public peace. The charges read in part, “That you, Blessing Njoku, sometime in November, around 8pm, at Oyingbo, Ebute Metta, in the Lagos Magisterial District, did obtain red oil valued at N505,000 from one Okafor Chinazor, with the pretence that you want to sell and pay him back, which you knew to be false, thereby committing an offence punishable under Section 314 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015.” The police prosecutor, Austin Adams, appealed to the court to help the complainant retrieve his money from the defendant. The Magistrate, Mrs Folarin Williams, granted the defendant bail and adjourned the matter till March 30, 2022. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
