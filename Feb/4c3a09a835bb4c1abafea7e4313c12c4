The convener, Gombe Women Ambassadors, Tabitha Sallah, has indicated interest to serve as the Organising Secretary, All Progressives Congress, North-East, adding that more women were needed in politics. The aspirant revealed that the meaningful participation of women in national, local, and community leadership roles has become an important focus in global development policy. Sallah made this disclosure in an interview with journalists, noting that she has garnered experience for the position as a convener of Buhari/ Osibanjo/Inuwa women ambassadors. According to her, as a philanthropist, she had provided loans to over 2,000 women to improve their businesses, stressing that this demonstrated her impact as an organiser and mobiliser. She said, “I’m from Bangu Balanga Local Government Area of Gombe State, a devoted community worker, civil society person, humanitarian, a philanthropist entrepreneur, women empowerment and mobilisation advocate. “I have been using my resources to cater for orphans and vulnerable children as well as women in northeastern Nigeria. “I wish to call on leaders to carefully look into the matter of the ratio of women holding government positions because, over the last two decades, the rate of women’s representation in national parliaments globally has incrementally increased from 11.8 per cent in 1998 to 17.8 per cent in 2008 to 23.5 per cent in 2018. “Some regions have seen a tremendous increase, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, where in the last 20 years the number of women in parliament has risen from 11 to 23.6 per cent, and the Arab States region, which has seen an increase from 3.1 to 17.5 per cent.” Copyright PUNCH.
