No fewer than seven people were killed on Tuesday when terrorists attacked three communities in the Zango Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State. The Southern Kaduna Peoples Union Public Relations Officer, Mr Luka Binniya, confirmed the incident to PUNCH Metro on Wednesday. According to him, the terrorists, in a well-coordinated attack, set ablaze many houses and lynched one person in Zaman Dabo, while six people were killed in Chibob and Sabon Kaura communities. Binniya explained that the terrorists invaded the villages in large numbers and opened fire on residents, destroying property worth millions of naira. “The terrorists also took advantage of the absence of the military in the early hours of Tuesday at a checkpoint between Ungwan Wakili and Abuyab and vandalised the only bridge linking the two communities. “As I am talking to you, not even a motorcycle can cross that bridge now. Something urgent needs to be done in order to fix the bridge because the people in those communities are living at the mercy of those terrorists,” he added. The state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, did not respond to calls put to his phone number on the incident as of the time of filing this report.  Copyright PUNCH.
