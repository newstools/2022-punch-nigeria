The biography of the immediate past Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, Hadizatu Mustapha, titled ‘Hadizatu Mustapha: From Head Girl to Supreme Court,’ will be presented on Saturday at the International Conference Centre, Abuja. The book was written by a former Editor of Business Times, Dotun Adekanmbi; and a lawyer with the Supreme Court of Nigeria, Sa’adatu Ahmed. This was disclosed in a statement on Wednesday by Adekanmbi. According to the statement, Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, is the chief host at the event, while a former governor of the state, Senator Kashim Shettima, will serve as the chief presenter. Adekanmbi said the book, published by Havilah Group, tells the story of the career Mustapha who retired in August 2021 as the second female to hold the position of Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court. “I agreed to the proposal to tell my story because it helps to illustrate my firm belief that the girl in Nigeria can achieve her best, if given the kind of unwavering support that I got from my own parents. “The book will help to fully clarify my passion for promoting the interest of the girl child,’’ the statement quoted Mustapha as saying.
