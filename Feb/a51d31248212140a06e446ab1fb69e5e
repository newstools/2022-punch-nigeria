The Cable News Network reported that Russia was ready to send representatives to the Belarusian capital of Minsk to talk with Ukraine. This was according to a readout from Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, in response to the request of the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “Following Zelensky’s proposal to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine, Putin can send representatives of the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Ministry and his administration to negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation,” the readout said. The readout added that Minsk was chosen as the venue for the proposed talk. In the meantime, CNN reported that Ukraine was under significant pressure, as Russian forces appeared to be closing in on Kyiv. The report indicated that the Russian forces have entered the Obolon district in the north of the city, just a few miles from its centre. Also, the Ukrainian forces have reportedly pushed the Russian forces back, having blown up the city bridge to stop their advancement. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
