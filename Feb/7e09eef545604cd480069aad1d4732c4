Relaxation and fun spot owners, eateries, bars and clubs in Anambra State are lamenting the huge losses their businesses are likely to suffer due to the sit-at-home today (Monday), which coincides with the Valentine’s Day  celebration. A fun spot operator based in Awka, Mr Stephen Ugo, who spoke to our correspondent on Sunday, said, “The Valentine’s Day always offers a huge spending exuberance on gifts, drinks, transportation, food, hotel lodging, nightclubs and even stuffs like condoms. “Businesses always make huge sales every year on the day. Last year, I know how much I made, but unfortunately, this year’s event is clashing with the sit-at-home, which will not afford us the opportunity to make sales as people will be staying indoors. This sit-at-home is really spoiling businesses in the region and the government must do something about it.” Our correspondent, who went round major cities like Awka, Onitsha and Nnewi, on Sunday, observed young people and adults in red and white outfits already celebrating Valentine’s Day in order not to miss out on the action as a result of the Monday sit-at-home. Most churches in the state marked the day by also preaching messages of love and sacrifice as well as organising various social gatherings for members. At a pentecostal church in Obosi, there was an evening get-together organised for couples and eligible singles.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
