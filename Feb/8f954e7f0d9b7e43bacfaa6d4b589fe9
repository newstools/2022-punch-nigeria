Armed men have killed a father, while they abducted a 12-year-old girl in Chukuku in the Kuje Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory. The armed men were said to have stormed the community in their large number and shot sporadically while the operation lasted. A resident of the area who pleaded anonymity said the incident had caused apprehension in the community. The source said the armed men were yet to reach out to the family for a ransom on the abducted girl. He said, “The gunmen came in their large number and attacked the residence of this man in Chukuku, along Old Chukuku road.
One person (an adult) was killed and his 12-year-old daughter was taken away. “The armed men came in the early hours of Tuesday and operated for hours and shot sporadically to the air throughout their operation. “So far, no form of communication has been made to or from the kidnappers. The incident has created fear in residents of the area.” When contacted, the FCT police command spokesperson, DSP Josephine Adeh, promised to find out. She had yet to do so at the time of filing this report. Calls put to her line afterwards were not answered. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
