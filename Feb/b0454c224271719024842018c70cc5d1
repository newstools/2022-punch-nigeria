The Federal Government is to engage state governors to address problems associated with right-of-way in states that have been delaying power projects across the country, the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, said on Wednesday. He said the Federal Government was planning to engage the governors through their forum in order to address the problem and ensure the timely completion of power projects. A statement issued in Abuja by the Federal Ministry of Power, stated that the minister disclosed the government’s plan while receiving the leadership of Eko Electricity Distribution Company. He noted that the government was taking inventory of all the right-of-way challenges nationwide and assured his guests that the issue shall be addressed. Abubakar said Eko Electricity Distribution Company was the best Disco in terms of financial performance, as he urged other Discos to follow the example of EkEDC. He, however, noted that Eko Disco could do more in the area of customer care and confidence. The minister said the government was doing its best in providing an enabling environment for all segments of the electricity value chain to perform optimumally. On power theft, Abubakar informed the meeting that currently there were over 100 ongoing projects by the Transmission Company of Nigeria that would help in addressing the menace and ensure grid stability. The Chairman, EKEDC, Dere Otubu, according to the statement, solicited the support of the minister for increased power capacity to Eko Disco. Dere, who was accompanied by the Managing Director, Eko Disco, Fadeyibi Adeoye, called for government’s intervention to end power theft, adding that EKEDC was ready to partner government for rural electrification.
