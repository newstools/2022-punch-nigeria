The Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria has presented certificates of accreditation to some bank academies, tertiary institutions and educational training service providers. The President/Chairman of Council, CIBN, Dr Bayo Olugbemi, made this presentation during a virtual event in Lagos on Tuesday. According to him, the benefits of the accreditation include assurance that the programmes have met international best practices, recognition of the concerned programmes, relevance of the concerned programmes, improved quality and consistency of the concerned programmes, and provision of learning pathway and increase in the knowledge and skills base of the staff in the industry. He said, “I must indeed congratulate the 17 educational training service providers and two bank academies who are going to be presented with their certificates of accreditation. I wish to equally say that today’s event will bring to 85 the total numbers of ETSPs and 21 bank academies respectively. “In particular, the accreditation of the academies would enable their graduates to secure exemptions thereby facilitating their completion of the examinations.” Olugbemi said it was not only another step in CIBN’s efforts to enhance the competencies of the practitioners in the banking, but a further manifestation of the mandate of the institute as the sole accreditation agency for the implementation of the competency framework in the banking industry. He reiterated the institute’s efforts in deepening competencies in the banking industry. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
