An advocacy group, Nigerian Patriotic Quest, has called on citizens to work together to reject the old class of career politicians in the next general elections. The group disclosed this in a statement on Thursday, adding that the biggest challenge to Nigeria’s progress was failed leadership. The statement read in part, “The biggest drawback to Nigeria’s emergence as a strong progressive nation lies in the failure of leadership. This leadership failure can be attributed to the stranglehold on the reins of power by the old class of career politicians. “This set of leaders has failed to use the instruments of power to build the nation, but are only interested in acquiring power for the sake of power. This has been the bane of Nigeria and it is disheartening that such characters are already parading the national space, with the intention of attaining power at various levels come 2023 to continue their destructive politics of self aggrandisement.” Copyright PUNCH.
