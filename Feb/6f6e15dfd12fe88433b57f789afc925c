MTV Base has announced Nigeria’s number one candy brand, TomTom, as the official sponsor of the new season of MTV Base Cypher which premieres on Sunday, February 27, 2022. Tagged ‘Freshman Class’, the all-new season (third in the sequence) is set to feature series of thrilling rap battles, amongst different teams, with winners to be determined by the viewers. Speaking about the TomTom sponsorship of the show, Category Manager, Morolake Emokpaire, was quoted in a statement as saying,  “Through the MTV Base Cypher, we are connecting the TomTom’s essence of giving consumers the clarity of voice and confidence for expression with the passion point of millions of Nigerians, music. Having kicked off our IMC campaign (Breathe For It) last year, sponsoring the MTV Base Cypher is just one of the many activities we have in store for TomTom. As a music genre that is fun, vibrant, refreshing and edgy, Rap is an integral part of the Nigerian music culture. It embodies the lyrical uniqueness and expressions of individual talents, and that’s something we connect to as a brand.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
