The National Youth Service Corps, on Thursday, threatened heavy sanctions against schools or officials caught aiding and abetting the fraudulent mobilisation of corps members for national service. The agency said the sanctions would include blacklisting of schools found guilty of infractions in the past three years. The Director-General, NYSC, Major General Shuaibu Ibrahim, stated this during the opening ceremony of the 2022 Batch ‘A’ pre-mobilisation workshop in Abuja, with the theme, ‘Enhancing the credibility of the mobilisation process through effective data control’. He said, “As you are all aware, data generated from the corps-producing institutions are the raw materials processed for the mobilisation. “This record is supposed to be pure and undiluted, but for selfish motives of some players along the production chain, we have continued to encounter challenges. “Let me, however, assure the public that we are not letting down our guard as we have continued to evolve and enhance control measures, including those that are technology-driven. These efforts require the buy-in of other relevant stakeholders, including student affairs officers. “Since coming on board in 2019, we have been having meetings with corps-producing institutions, especially the student affairs officers, so that our mobilisation process will not be compromised. “We also introduced indemnity requiring the head of institutions to endorse whatever data are forwarded to the NYSC, so that if there is any infraction, the scheme can apply sanctions. That is what we have been doing. We have blacklisted institutions guilty of such infractions.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
