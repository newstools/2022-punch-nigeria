The Chief Judge of Katsina State, Justice Musa Abubakar, on Thursday, granted bail to 126 inmates of custodial centres, released one and sentenced three others to community service. The beneficiaries included aged inmates, those with serious health challenges and those who displayed “good character and industry while in custody.” Justice Abubakar exercised the power after visiting various custodial centres in the state. He explained that the review of the inmates’ cases was carried out across the state with a view to decongesting the custodial centres, adding that he was looking forward to other alternative measures to imprisonment. The chief judge commended the hard work and dedication of officers and men of the Nigerian Correctional Service, Katsina State Command, and urged them to keep up the good work. He stated that the command was among the best in Nigeria in terms of service delivery. Justice Abubakar had earlier given similar commendation to four officers of the command, who served with mobile courts during the climax of the COVID-19 pandemic in the state. A statement by the spokesman for the command, Ibrahim Wada, said the Controller of Corrections, Katsina State Command, Muhammad Haruna, commended the chief judge for the visit and the review of the inmates’ cases. The controller was quoted to have observed that decongesting the custodial facilities would enable the service to perform its statutory duties of reforming, rehabilitating and reintegrating the inmates back to society as law-abiding citizens.
