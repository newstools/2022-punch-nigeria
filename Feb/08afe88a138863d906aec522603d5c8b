In an apparent effort to dissuade Nigerians, particularly youngsters, from engaging in money ritual, ace video director, Olalekan Oluwasegun, aka Unlimited L.A, has urged accomplished individuals to start showing the younger generation how people with legitimate means of income are making money. The ace cinematographer said in a post on Twitter that it was time the younger generation subscribed to an honest means of income. The post read, “I think it’s time we let these young boys understand that honest/legit workers are also making money too. We are just too busy to show off. Before dem use everybody do rituals finish.” Unlimited LA joined singer, Timaya, who had also expressed shock over the news of the alleged teenage ritual killers. The PUNCH had reported that four teenagers were arrested by men of the Ogun State Police Command for beheading a girl, identified as Rofiat, for money ritual in the Abeokuta area of the state. Many of such cases had been reported in other parts of the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
