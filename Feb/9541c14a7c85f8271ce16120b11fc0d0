The Lagos State Government through the Traditional Medicine Board has expressed its readiness to enforce the directives of the National Council on Health which mandates all practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine in every part of the country to register their operations or face the full wrath of the law, as prescribed by the National Council on Health. Speaking on the NCH directives, which was part of the resolutions reached at the 62nd meeting of Traditional Medicine Practitioners held in 2021 at Asaba, Delta State, the Registrar of Lagos State Traditional Medicine Board, Mr. Olorunkemi Kadiku, said the Board had given unregistered practitioners in the state the opportunity to perfect their registration before the end of March 2022. According to the Registrar, all complementary and alternative medicine practitioners including product manufacturers, importers, wholesalers and retailers are required to regularise their practice as well as register their premises with the Traditional Medicine Board, or risk their premises being sealed.
