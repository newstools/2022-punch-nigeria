Topgy Systems and Management Consultants says it has rewarded some of its outstanding employees for their contributions to the company’s growth. The Founder and Chairman/Chief Executive Officer, Topgy Systems and Management Consultants, Tokunbo Oshinyemi, announced the employees and their rewards during a dinner organised to celebrate the company’s 20th anniversary in Lagos. “As part of our efforts to boost the morale of our employees and appreciate their contributions to the company in its 20 years of operation, we rewarded some of our staff with lands,” he said. He said two of the beneficiaries were former staff members who resigned recently, adding that the company appreciated their past contributions. He said the company, which started in Nigeria, had grown to become an international brand with presence in some African countries. Oshinyemi said in recognition of its contributions in the sector, the Federal Government recognised the company as a leading fixed asset management firm in 2012. “One of the achievements is the recognition given to me personally by the Commonwealth University on the doctorate degree with specialisation in fixed assets. They gave it because of the achievement we have made in the aspect of fixed assets,” he said. According to him, the company will ensure that it boosts its services with tech and continues to be innovative because that is the trend of development globally. He said the company was working to automate all its processes, adding that it had launched mobile applications, among others. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
