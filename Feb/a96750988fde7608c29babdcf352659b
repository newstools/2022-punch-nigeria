Reach4Christ, an interdenominational outreach team, visited some correctional centres in Ogun State, where they donated food items, sewing machines, mattresses and beverages, preached the gospel and recorded new converts. Ahead of the 80th birthday celebration of the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the team has embarked on an 80-day soul-winning global challenge. The correctional centres visited by the Ogun State chapter of the Reach4Christ team included the Ijebu-Ode Correctional Centre, Abeokuta Maximum Prison, Borstal Homes, Ibara Correctional Centre, and Sagamu Correctional Centre, amongst others. In each of the visits, the team members, who were warmly received by the prison authorities, preached to the prisoners and souls were won for Christ. At Borstal Home, Abeokuta, 121 souls were said to have been won while Ibara Correctional Centre recorded 42 converts. Sagamu Correctional Centre and Ijebu-Ode Prison both recorded 43 converts each.
