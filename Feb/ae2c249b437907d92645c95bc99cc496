Shooting Stars coach Edith Agoye hailed match winner Sunday Faleye’s impact in the 1-0 win over Dakkada FC in their match-day 12 NPFL fixture in Ibadan on Sunday, as they returned to winning ways after their 1-0 loss to Remo Stars last week. Faleye scored the only goal of the encounter in the 82nd minute to hand his side the win, as they moved to sixth on the table after 12 games. It is Faleye’s second debut for the team after returning from Czech Republic side Dukla Prague and the tricky forward played a simple one-two pass with a teammate before firing a low shot past the Dakkada goalkeeper. Agoye was full of praises for the forward after his performance, despite playing a substitute role. “The goal he scored is an example of the quality he can bring to any team. We are delighted that everything we thought of before bringing him, he showed it in a few minutes,” Agoye said after the game. “We can only hope that he’ll build on this momentum and we will be able to see more of him.” Faleye also stated that his return to Ibadan was to help the Oluyole Warriors play continental football next season. “It’s always a big opportunity for me to play for the club and I believe all the players know the importance of the win and what they need to do to be better and fight for a continental ticket,” Faleye told The PUNCH after the game. “My return to the club will motivate the players, and we are already working together to ensure that the team is in the right place and the players are happy. “My target is to see the team do well.”  Copyright PUNCH.
