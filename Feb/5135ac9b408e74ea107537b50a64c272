The Coordinator, Edo State National Youth Service Corps, Abiodun Olubukola, on Thursday, said that 12 corps members who absconded from the one year mandatory service will have to repeat the programme. Mrs Olubukola said this in Benin during the passing-out ceremony of 2021 Batch ‘A’ stream 1 Corp members. She warned that the scheme has zero tolerance to truancy during the service year. She said 687 Corps members were passing out in the state, noting that six of them have distinguished themselves in the area of primary assignment, community development service as well as special contributions during the orientation exercise. She said, “The 12 Corp members who are to repeat the service absconded from their primary assignment.They will repeat the service in another location. “The NYSC through its health initiative for rural dwellers programme attended to the health need of 1,239 people in the state using corps medical personnel.” She charged the corps members to be good ambassadors of the scheme and utilise the skill learnt through its skill acquisition and entrepreneurship development programme to be self reliant. On his part, the Edo state governor, Godwin Obaseki, charged the corps members to utilise the experience garnered through its skill development programme to establish small and medium scale enterprises to become self employed and employers of labour. Represented by his deputy, Philip Shaibu, Obaseki said their contributions to the social economic development of the state, in the area of agriculture, social service, education and rural infrastructure would be cherished by the government and Edo people.
