There was an uneasy calm at Sabon Gàrin Mallam Yauza community, Batagarawa Local Government Area of Katsina State on Wednesday following the murder of a businessman early in the morning by gunmen. The businessman, Alhaji Abu Mai Bulawus, reportedly bled to death after the gunmen had attacked him in his house located in the community which is close to the training school of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps. Residents disclosed that the gunmen arrived the community around 2am and headed for the house of the late businessman. It was further learnt that the gunmen operated for 30 minutes in the residence, trying to abduct the man. A resident who pleaded for anonymity disclosed that the gunmen eventually shot at the man several times following his refusal to go with them (the gunmen). The Divisional Police Officer in Batagarawa was also said to have led his men to the community after the gunmen had fled to the forest. Residents said the remains of the slain businessman was burried in the community on Wednesday evening.
