Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has mocked the All Progressives Congress over its inability to conduct its national convention earlier slated for this weekend. The governor said a party that cannot organise its convention should be viewed as inept in administering the country. Wike spoke at a reception organised to celebrate the National Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, Samuel Anyanwu, by the Imo State chapter of the party in Owerri, the state capital, on Wednesday. This was contained in a statement by the media aide to the governor, Kelvin Ebiri, and made available to journalists in Port Harcourt. The governor said, “Nigerians are angry because the party (APC) at the national level is a failure. It is a failure to the point that they are ruling Nigeria with tension. To sign the Electoral Act, they keep postponing it every day and Nigerians are tired. “What they are doing is to postpone convention. A party that cannot hold a national convention, is it a party that can rule Nigeria? “Ordinary convention, a party in power cannot hold one. Look at how we did our own convention. That is to tell you that the PDP is the party that should rule Nigeria. This is the party that will rule Imo State too.” Wike enjoined members of the PDP in the state not to succumb to any form of intimidation. He said the days of such intimidation were gone and urged them to forge a common front, saying there has to be a party before election is won. The chairman of the PDP Board of Trustees, Walid Jubril, acknowledged the work done by the leaders of the party to ensure it waxes stronger. The party’s National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, led members of the National Working Committee to the event.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
