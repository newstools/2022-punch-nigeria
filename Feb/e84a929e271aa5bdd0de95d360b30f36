A former commissioner for Works and Transportation in Ekiti State, Funmilayo Ogun, has rejected the nomination for the position of Deputy Governor in the upcoming gubernatorial election in the state. Ogun, who was commissioner during Ayo Fayose’s administration and the state Secretary of the People’s Democratic Party, said she rejected the nomination for personal reasons and urged the party to nominate a fresh candidate. She made this known in a statement dated Thursday, February 24, 2022, titled, ‘Ekiti 2022. Re: My nomination as Deputy Governorship Candidate’. The statement read in part, “This is to formally inform you that I am not unaware of my nomination by Ekiti Stakeholders for the position of the Deputy Governorship Candidate in the 18th June 2022 Gubernatorial Election. “Notwithstanding their good intentions, I formally write to reject the nomination for personal reasons. “However, I appreciate the uncommon recognition and assuring the Party that no effort will be spared at ensuring our victory at the election.” The ex-commissioner added that another candidate should be approached for a fresh nomination. Meanwhile, the immediate past chairman of the party, Bisi Kolawole, had been declared the party’s governorship candidate for the June 18, 2022 poll. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
