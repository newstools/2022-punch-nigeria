NAPOLI coach Luciano Spalletti has played down any injury fears concerning Victor Osimhen ahead of the Partenopei’s away clash with Lazio at the Olimpico stadium on Sunday (today), PUNCH Sports reports. The Nigerian striker has been struggling with a swollen knee this season. Osimhen was seen limping off with his knee strapped with ice after he was replaced in the 73rd minute in Napoli’s 4-2 loss to Barcelona last Thursday raising concerns over his fitness level ahead of the fixture. But Spalletti insists there is nothing to worry about Osimhen. Asked about Osimhen’s fitness ahead of their game against Lazio, Spalletti replied, “He (Osimhen) is ok. Osimhen is very good, he can play 90 minutes.” Osimhen has notched seven goals in 16 league appearances (11 goals in 21 games across all competitions) this season for Napoli and will be hoping to add to his tally against the Biancocolesti in the encounter having scored once against Lazio last season in their 5-2 rout of Maurizio Sarri’s side. Both teams will be aiming to redeem their image after they crashed out of the Europa League last Thursday. The Partenopei were dumped out of the competition by Barcelona 5-3 on aggregate, while Lazio went out 4-3 on aggregate against FC Porto. Napoli, currently third in the Serie A log with 54 points from 26 games, can go top of the table if they beat Lazio who are placed sixth. On Friday, Inter Milan missed the chance to move level on points with Serie A leaders AC Milan at the top of the standings after they were held to a 0-0 draw at relegation-threatened Genoa, stretching the champions’ winless league run to four games.
