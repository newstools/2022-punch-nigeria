Justice Abiola Soladoye of the Lagos State Special Offences Court, Ikeja, on Thursday, sentenced a driver, Abiodun Matthew, to life imprisonment for raping a four-year-old pupil of the University of Lagos Women Society Nursery and Primary School, Akoka, Lagos. PUNCH Metro had reported that Matthew raped the minor on the school premises on March 23, 2019. Our correspondent reported that Matthew used to pick two pupils at the school after closing hours on the instruction of their parents. The driver, in the course of time, became close to a teacher at the school, identified as Madumere. Madumere sometimes left the pupils in the care of the driver. During the period, the 39-year-old driver molested the kindergarten pupil. The convict was arrested by the police and charged with sexual assault by penetration. He pleaded not guilty to the charge. The trial commenced and the prosecution called four witnesses. Delivering her judgement on Thursday, Justice Soladoye held that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. She said, “The defendant’s defence of alibi does not fly. His statement that he was elsewhere when the act occurred was false as he was busy fiddling with the private parts of the victim. “The defendant having been found guilty as charged under Section 261 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State is hereby sentenced to life imprisonment with no option of fine. “His name is to be entered into the Sexual Offenders Register maintained by the Lagos State Government.” Copyright PUNCH.
