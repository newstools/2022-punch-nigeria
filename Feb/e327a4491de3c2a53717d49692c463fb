The Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, on Thursday, set aside the judgment of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, which invalidated the Kano State ward and Local Government congresses. Upholding the appeal, filed by the Ganduje-led faction of the Kano All Progressives Congress, the appellate court held that the High court lacked the jurisdiction to try the case. It would be recalled that the Ibrahim Shekarau-led faction approached the FCT High Court, Abuja, shortly after the APC congresses in Kano during which the court upheld the group’s congresses, as against that of the governor Ganduje-led side. Dissatisfied with the High Court ruling, Ganduje’s group headed to the Appeal Court to contest the ruling. Also, in its ruling, the appellate court held that the case was not a pre-election matter but an internal matter of the ruling party, and therefore should be decided by the leadership of APC.
