The Katsina State Police Command early Thursday killed one suspected terrorist and rescued eight kidnap victims, including four babies. Also recovered from the terrorists were 82 cows, 70 sheep and one AK-47 rifle. A spokesman for the command, SP Gambo Isah, confirmed the development on Thursday at the police headquarters, where the rescued victims and the corpse of the terrorist as well as the recovered AK-47 were displayed. He said, “On February 1, 2022, around 12.40am, a distress call was received that terrorists in large numbers, armed with sophisticated weapons, including AK-47 rifles, while riding on motorbikes attacked Fuloti and Karfi villages in the Malumfashi Local Government Area of the state, kidnapped women and rustled domestic animals and were on their way to Kankara. “Consequently, DPO Kankara led a team of policemen and blocked the hoodlums at a spot near Zurunkutun, crossing the Kankara-Sheme Road. The team succeeded and engaged the terrorists in a fierce gun duel. The team neutralised one of them, rescued four female victims and their babies, and recovered one AK-47 rifle, 82 cows and 70 sheep.” The police spokesman revealed that a bandit was also gunned down in another operation on Tuesday along the Kankara-Zango Road. According to him, a group of terrorists had barricaded the road that evening and were extorting money from road users. The police operatives were mobilised to the location, where they engaged in another gun duel with the terrorists. The suspect was reportedly killed in the process, while a brand new motorcycle was recovered from the assailants. Isah said investigation was ongoing into the two incidents. Copyright PUNCH.
