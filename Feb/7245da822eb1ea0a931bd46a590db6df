Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has ordered that all schools in Ijebu-Igbo and its environs should be shut down on Wednesday over the installation of a new Orimolusi. The PUNCH had reported earlier that Ijebu-Igbo had been without a traditional ruler for 28 years. But, recently, the Abiodun-led government approved the nomination of Prince Lawrence Jaiyeoba Adebajo as the new Oba of the community after he was selected by a committee. Abiodun said all academic activities should be halted on Wednesday as a mark of honour for the new monarch. The governor said the action was also done to allow teachers, parents, and students to participate in the event. A statement signed by the Secretary to the State Government, Tokunbo Talabi, read, “After 28 years of interregnum, a new Orimolusi of Ijebu-Igbo, His Royal Highness, Oba Lawrence Jaiyeoba Adebajo, will be crowned on Wednesday, February 23rd, 2022 at Ijebu-Igbo. “An event of this magnitude would draw sons, daughters, and indeed guests and well-wishers to the ancient town of Ijebu-Igbo. “Therefore, as a mark of honour for the new monarch and to ensure a memorable event, the Governor of Ogun State, His Excellency, Prince Dapo Abiodun, MFR, has directed that all schools in Ijebu-Igbo and its environs should not open on Wednesday, 23rd February, 2022. “This is to give room for the parents, teachers, and indeed learners to partake in the epochal event.” Talabi urged the people of Ijebu-Igbo to cooperate with law enforcement agents as well as traffic controllers during the event.
