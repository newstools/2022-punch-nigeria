Gunmen in military camouflage have shot a businessman dead in the Ifo Local Government Area of Ogun State. The deceased, Oso Femi, was reportedly the owner of Osofem Oil and Gas located at Nitel Bus Stop in the area. The incident was reported to have occurred around 10pm on Sunday when the deceased planned to close for the day. A man, who claimed to be the deceased’s nephew, and who identified himself as Harbee, explained that the gunmen were all clad in military camouflage. He added that they stormed the filling station, shot him in the head and waited to ensure he died before they left with his car, marked EKY903GZ. He said, “They were all in military uniform. It happened at Osofem Oil and Gas, Nitel Bus-Stop at Ifo, Ogun State, around 10pm on Sunday. “He was about going home when they came to attack him. He tried to escape and they shot him on the head, took his car and his money and went away.” On Wednesday morning, Harbee said the deceased’s Toyota Corolla has been found at the Obada Oko area of Abeokuta. He said, “We found the car at Obada Oko. The car was parked in the bush. It’s currently at the police station.” When contacted for reaction, the Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident. Oyeyemi said the incident is being investigated. He, however, declared that the incident was a case of armed robbery. He said, “The robbers in military uniform must have got a hint that the man was with a certain amount of money, which was driven away in his car after killing him. “It is a case of armed robbery and the command is investigating it. We learnt they came in military uniform and they killed the man. We are still investigating the incident.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
