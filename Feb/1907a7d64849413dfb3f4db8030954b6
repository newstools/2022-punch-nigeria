Gombe United FC on Thursday beat the visiting MFM FC 3-0 at the Pantami township stadium, located in the state metropolis. Yusuf Abdulazeez’s goal nine minutes into the commencement of the match opened the way for two others scored by Mohammed Aminu and Abubakar Sa’ad. However, the visitors made serious attempts to garner strength in order to at least equalise; all to no avail. Speaking shortly after the match, the technical adviser of the Savannah Scorpion, Aliyu Zubairu, while lauding the efforts of his boys, revealed that the goal jinx has been surmounted. He dedicated his team’s success to teeming supporters, adding that the club would work assiduously to maintain the tempo. The team had on Sunday suffered a 2-0 defeat in Ilorin, during match-day nine encounter. Zubairu said, “We have broken the jinx of goals scoring. We will build on it. It is a work in progress. If you look at our performances on the road have not been good, since we pick a pick at Nasarawa United, we have not got any again. We will continue to work until we get it right.” Also speaking, the gaffer of MFM FC, Olalekan Gabriel, said his team would not relent, stressing that he was satisfied with the officiating officials. He added, “I gave instructions to my players but you know players, when they get to the field of play they do whatever they like, that’s why we conceded cheap goals.” Copyright PUNCH.
