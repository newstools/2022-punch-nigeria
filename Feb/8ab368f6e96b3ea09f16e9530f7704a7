A former Big Brother Naija housemate, Lucy Edet, has said that she is no longer excited about marriage. In an interview with Saturday Beats, “I am turning 32 in April. I have been very stubborn about it (marriage) and my mother has come to accept that marriage may not be for me. Perhaps, I will just have a child. She (mother) told me two days ago that I should just produce a child and I laughed. “Pressure for marriage isn’t for me because I am more concerned about connecting and living happily with the right person. Until I am able to build my life around that person, I don’t think I want to settle down. “If I feel pressured to get married, I could have done that since I used to be crazy about marriage; but not anymore.” Lucy, who has often been accused of reducing her age, said, “People should leave me alone because it is my age and my choice. I feel it is society that has caused that because many people reduce their ages just to get jobs or to be accepted in the society. But, that has never made sense to me. I have always stuck with my real age. “I don’t see why someone’s thoughts about me should bother me. As long as you are speaking the truth, I won’t be angry about it. However, I have issues with people making up stories. I have heard so many things about me that shocked me.” Speaking on her latest projects, the former reality show contestant said, “I still run my grill business from home. Also, I have done a grill show which is yet to be aired. One the show, I grill for celebrities who give their honest opinion about it, and we have other conversations. I have done two movies so far and I am hoping to open a physical space for my business soon.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
