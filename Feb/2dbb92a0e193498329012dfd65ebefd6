Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, on Wednesday stormed the Plateau State High Court sitting in Jos where a former Governor of the state, Jonah Jang, is being arraigned. Jang is standing trial alongside Yusuf Pam, an ex-cashier in the office of the Secretary to the Government of the State, on alleged N6.3bn fraud charges brought before the court by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The two accused persons were first arraigned before Justice Daniel Longji in March 2018 on 17 counts bordering on criminal breach of trust and misappropriation of public funds but they had since pleaded not guilty to the charges. The case is currently before Justice Christy Dabup who started hearing on the matter afresh following the retirement of Justice Longji in December 2019, after hearing the matter 34 times. Wike, clad in a dark blue suit and a white shirt, arrived at the state High Court around 9.50am in the company of other PDP chieftains and moved straight to Court 2 where the trial was already in progress. Counsel to Jang, Mike Ozekhome, SAN, told the judge that the Rivers State Governor was in the court to witness the trial of his client. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
