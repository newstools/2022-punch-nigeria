An intensive care specialist firm, Anesthesia and Critical Care Consultants, has announced an agreement to manage the intensive care unit of Duchess International Hospital, Lagos. The firm’s Commercial Director, Mr Akintunde Sawyerr, in a statement on Tuesday, said A3C was delighted to be involved in the progress of the 72-bed multi-specialty hospital. The Chief Executive Officer of the firm, Dr Seyi Oyesola, in the statement, said the Intensive Care specialty was the only medical specialty that cuts across all medical specialties. “A3C is positioned and ready to offer training and education to doctors who wish to learn the specialty, especially as Critical Care is not offered at postgraduate level anywhere in West Africa,” he said. The Chairman of the Reddington Hospital Group and promoter of the Duchess Hospital, Dr Yemi Onabowale, said the project was a one-stop multi-speciality, multi-disciplinary facility, where the best hospital care would be delivered together with world-class hospitality service. Also, the Clinical lead, A3C, Dr Ken Adegoke, said the firm would bring the right skill set and methodology to complement the objectives of the hospital to save lives and the often unnecessary need to travel abroad for treatment. According to the statement, A3C is a group practice, made up of foreign-trained Nigerian Consultants in Critical Care and a host of other Critical care staff grades, who are able to make Intensive care more affordable. .
