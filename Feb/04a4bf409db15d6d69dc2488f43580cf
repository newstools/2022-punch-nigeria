The management of Air Peace airline has informed the general public of the situation that led to a delay in an Abuja to Asaba flight on Thursday. In a statement titled, ‘Asaba Aistairs Situation’, the airline noted that the Asaba Airport in Delta State had only one airstair and this made passengers disembark later than they should. The airline also noted that the situation may cause subsequent delays all through today, as they apologised for the inconveniences their passengers may experience. The statement read, “This is to notify the flying public that on-ground Asaba today, the passengers onboard our Abuja-Asaba flight P47866 could not disembark as at when due because there was only one airstair at the Asaba Airport and other aircraft which landed before ours were taking turns in using it. “This consequently delayed the passengers of this flight as well as those already on ground waiting to board the same aircraft to Lagos. It also implies that all other flights rostered for this aircraft will be unavoidably delayed. “In as much as we regret the inconveniences caused by the situation, the provision of airstairs does not lie with the airlines but the ground handling service providers.” Copyright PUNCH.
