A 45-year-old man, Rufus Olatunji, has been remanded in a custodial centre for allegedly raping and impregnating a 14-year-old girl on the premises of the Royal World Embassy Church, Ipaja, in the Alimosho Local Government Area of Lagos State. Olatunji was alleged to have had unlawful carnal knowledge of the girl for several months before she became pregnant. The defendant, who was arraigned on Tuesday before an Ebute Meta Magistrates’ Court, was also said to have given the minor a concoction in a bid to abort the pregnancy. He allegedly threatened to deal with the teenager if she did not drink the concoction. The charges read in part, “That you, Rufus Olatunji, sometime in August 2021, inside the Royal World Embassy Church, Ipaja, Lagos, in the Lagos Magisterial District, did have unlawful sexual intercourse with a 14-year-old girl, thereby committing an offence under Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. “That you, Rufus Olatunji, sometime in August 2021, within the premises of Royal World Embassy Church, Ipaja, Lagos, in the Lagos Magisterial District, did unlawfully cause the 14-year-old to take noxious substances with the intent to procure a miscarriage, thereby committing an offence punishable under Section 145(1) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.” The police prosecutor, Olatunde Kehinde, urged the court to remand the defendant in custody. The Magistrate, Mrs Alani Kayode, granted the application and adjourned the matter till March 8, 2022, for trial. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
