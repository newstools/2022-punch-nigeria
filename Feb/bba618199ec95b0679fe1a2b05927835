There is palpable tension in the Enugu metropolis on Thursday afternoon as gunmen killed three policemen at a checkpoint in Enugu State. The incident was said to have happened around 1:20 pm at a police checkpoint near Ulumalinda Estate by Maryland suburb of the Enugu South Local Government Area of the state. The gunmen were said to have kidnapped a woman along the road after the operation which eyewitnesses told our correspondent that lasted for about 30 minutes without challenge. An eyewitness told our correspondent that the hoodlums robbed a POS mobile money operator after a stray bullet hit her. When contacted, the police public relations officer, Daniel Ndukwe, confirmed the incident but didn’t provide details. He simply said, “details are sketchy but a manhunt has been launched for the attackers.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
