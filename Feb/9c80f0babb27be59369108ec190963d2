Syria said on Tuesday it supports Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognise two Ukrainian breakaway republics as independent. “Syria supports President Putin’s decision to recognise the republics of Luhansk and Donetsk and will cooperate with them,’’ Faisal Mikdad said. The state-run Syrian News Agency quoted the country’s foreign minister, Faisal Mikdad, as telling the Valdai Forum in Moscow on Tuesday. “What the West is doing against Russia today is similar to what it did against Syria during the terrorist war,’’ he was quoted as saying. Russia has been the main ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad since the war broke out in Syria in 2011. On Monday, Putin informed French President Emmanuel Macron and Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany in a phone call of his decision to sign a decree recognising the independence of the two pro-Russia republics. The two pro-Russia republics comprised the part of eastern Ukraine known as the Donbas region. Mikdad said that the United States and the West continue to support terrorism in Syria, which posed a threat to the Middle East and the world. (dpa/NAN)
