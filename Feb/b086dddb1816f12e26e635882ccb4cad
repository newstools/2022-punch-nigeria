A much-changed Rangers side cruised into the Scottish Cup quarter-finals with a 3-0 win over fourth-tier Annan Athletic in Aaron Ramsey’s first start for the Glasgow giants. Centre-back Filip Helander was also making his comeback after five months out through injury and opened the scoring from a corner on seven minutes. Kemar Roofe smashed in from the edge of the area before Fashion Sakala’s attempted cross flew into the top corner before half-time. Giovanni van Bronckhorst had made 11 changes with one eye on a trip to Borussia Dortmund in the Europa League on Thursday and the visitors eased up in the second half to preserve their energies in dreadful weather conditions. Ramsey had made two substitute appearances since sealing his deadline day loan move from Juventus and was denied a first Rangers goal shortly after half-time by the offside flag. “It was good to be back out there,” said the Welshman after his first club start since August. “I’m just excited to be a part of this now and hopefully I can contribute to helping the team reach our targets this season.” Celtic are in action on Sunday when they host Raith Rovers. The pressure is mounting on Aberdeen boss Stephen Glass after his side were dumped out 2-1 at Motherwell. Aberdeen went in front after just three minutes at Fir Park through Christian Ramirez, but Kevin van Veen and Connor Shields turned the tie around before half-time. The Dons sit ninth in the Scottish Premiership table in Glass’ first season in charge. Hearts needed penalties to book their place in the quarter-finals after a 0-0 draw against Livingston. St Mirren saw off League Two Kelty Hearts 4-0, while Dundee United were 1-0 winners at Partick Thistle to reach the last eight. AFP
