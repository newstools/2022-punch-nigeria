A singer, songwriter, producer and entrepreneur, Osayi Iyamu, aka Gee Rockkie, has joined the over 12,000 voting members of the prestigious Recording Academy also known as the Grammy Awards. Gee Rockie, who hails from Benin City, Edo State, noted that he was excited by the development. He told Saturday Beats, “I consider it to be a honour. The Recording Academy is a globally recognised and respected organisation, and it means so much to me and my career to be identified with them.” Recalling how he started his journey in the entertainment industry, Iyamu said, “I actually started singing and writing songs at the tender age of eight. Fortunately, I have been able to work with a number of afrobeats icons.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
