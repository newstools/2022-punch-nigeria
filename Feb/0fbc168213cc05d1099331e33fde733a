Gunmen have attacked Atisa community in Kurmin Masara, Zangon Kataf Local Government of Kaduna State. This happened just 24 hours after 11 people were killed in the same Kurmin Masara. A source from the neighbouring village, who confirmed the attack to DailyTrust, said the shootings were ongoing as of 11.45pm on Monday. He said, “The gunmen arrived around 9.50pm and started shooting sporadically. As I am talking to you right now, I am still hearing the gunshots. It has been on for over an hour. “Because most of the residents deserted their homes in Kurmin Masara yesterday, the attackers decided to attack Atisa, a nearby settlement of the same Kurmin Masara axis.” Confirming the attack, the Youth Leader of Atyap Chiefdom, Gabriel Joseph, said the agenda is to wipe them out.
