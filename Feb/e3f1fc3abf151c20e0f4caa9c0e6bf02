The ECOWAS Court of Justice on Friday said that it has not received any matter relating to the trial of Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho in Benin Republic. The Deputy President of the Court, Justice Dupe Atoki, stated this at the end of the court’s one-week sensitisation mission to Kwara State. Atoki said the court of the 15-member West African countries only concerns itself with civil matters brought before it. Declared wanted by the Department of State Services for allegedly stockpiling arms to destabilise Nigeria, an allegation he denied, Igboho escaped to the neighbouring francophone country in July 2021. However, luck ran out on him and he was arrested by the Interpol at a Benin airport when he tried to board a Germany-bound flight. He had since been remanded in a prison in Benin Republic for over six months where he is said to be facing trial for immigration-related offences, amongst others. Asked to comment on Igboho’s ordeal, Atoki said, “Obviously, there has been no complaint about Sunday Igboho before the court and for all intents and purposes, the court has no idea of who Sunday Igboho is and what is happening to him. “The court is only concerned with matters that have been brought before it and if matters had not been brought before it, we would just be a meddlesome interloper trying to fish out issues in public domain.” The deputy president of the ECOWAS court, who said a total number of 583 cases had been received with 179 pending cases, added that it has given rulings on 131 cases and delivered judgement on 303 matters. Atoki also said that decisions had been passed on 21 cases, adding that 54 out of the pending cases are from Nigeria. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
