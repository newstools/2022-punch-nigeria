THE Speaker, Abia State House of Assembly, Chinedum Orji, was forced to wind down the activities of the House on Tuesday following an attempt to impeach some principal officers. Those who escaped sack included the Deputy Speaker and member representing Ohafia South State Constituency, Ifeanyi Uchendu and the Majority Leader and member representing Obingwa East State Constituency, Solomon Akpulonu, both of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party. This followed a motion for the immediate removal or suspension of the duo, moved by the Deputy Majority Leader, Paul Taribo, the member representing Ukwa East State Constituency and seconded by the Minority leader, Chijioke Chukwu representing Bende North State Constituency. Taribo said the motion was due to the inability of the two to perform their statutory functions creditably as principal officers of the House “especially as it concerns the welfare of members.” According to the motion, “the two members  have under-performed and have lost the confidence of the house.” However, the motion threw the House into a rowdy session with the Speaker arguing that their reasons were lame. He, therefore, adjourned the plenary session indefinitely following a motion by the member representing Umunneochi State Constituency, Okey Igwe, that the House should be adjourned for the matter to be entertained at the executive session.
