Guinea Insurance has launched a self-service motor insurance e-portal that allows customers to purchase motor insurance products in less than two minutes. The company disclosed this in a statement titled ‘Guinea insurance launches a motor insurance self-service portal; Purchasing process takes less than two minutes.’ The Managing Director, Guinea Insurance, Ademola Abidogun, said that the motor insurance portal was launched to provide the insuring public with unlimited access to make real-time purchases from anywhere and whenever they needed to. Speaking during the launch in Lagos, Ademola said the portal would give customers the freedom to buy authentic and reliable motor insurance policies without any geographical barrier, if the vehicle is within the Nigerian land borders. He said, “As it stands today, consumer behaviour is undeniably shifting and favouring effortlessness more than before, whether by simply engaging with a business quickly and conveniently or by easily accessing the most relevant information to meet their individual needs. “Our customers nationwide would be able to choose and make informed decisions to purchase motor insurance products that best suit their insurance needs.” “Our digital transformation is driven with these key concepts in mind. By updating and improving upon the portal, we aim to provide policyholders with all the information and tools they need to self-serve at any time, creating a seamless experience and better meeting their needs.” The Group Lead, ICT, Damilare Bakare, said innovation was fundamental to any insurance company during this era of fast-growing technology.
