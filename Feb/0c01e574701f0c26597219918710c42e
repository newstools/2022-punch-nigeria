THE Osun State All Progressives Congress faction supported by the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, on Sunday said the purported dismissal of the petition filed by its candidate, Moshood Adeoti, in the recently held governorship primary of the party, was a rumour. A statement signed by the Publicity Secretary of the faction, Abiodun Agboola, obtained in Osogbo, said the group has not been informed that the Appeal Committee that would treat Adeoti’s petition had been set up by the national leadership of the APC. Adeoti had petitioned the APC Appeal panel challenging the outcome of the election after Governor Adegbesola Oyetola, was declared the winner of the governorship primary. But Agboola in his statement said, “In line with the guideline and timetable of the primary, Alhaji Adeoti filed a petition to the Osun APC governorship primary election Appeal Committee on Tuesday, February 22. “His lawyers were at the National Secretariat of the APC on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday with the aim of knowing and meeting the Appeal Committee. “They were told that the National Secretariat was yet to constitute the committee and up till now, we are not aware of any Appeal Committee on the Osun APC governorship primary. We are, however, surprised to read the junk, or better put, rumour on social media that the Appeal Committee had sat and dismissed Alhaji Adeoti’s petition. We urge the general public to disregard such a rumour.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
