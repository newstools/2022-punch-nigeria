Leky Mills, an agro-allied food processing company, says it has launched its new yam products into the Nigerian market. The company said it aimed to provide quality and affordable processed yam products to consumers and bridge the gap between local production and household consumption in domestic and foreign markets within the short to medium term. According to a statement, yam sticks and yam chips are available in different product sizes and packaging of 600g and 2.5kg. The company said it unveiled a Nigerian singer, Teniola Akpata, popularly known as Teni, as its brand ambassador at a press briefing in Lagos. Speaking during the unveiling, the Chief Executive Officer/Co-founder Leky Mills, Derinsola Adebayo, said, “Our choice of an ambassador is informed by her long history and deep commitment to commercial collaborations. We believe she has a strong personality, and with a proven track record, she engages with our target audience at a massive scale. “We also want to share to the world this new innovative product that we came up with – a solution, and not just any solution, but a Nigerian and African solution to a problem that we all face. We believe Leky Mills offers those solutions by providing quality and affordable processed yam products to consumers.’’ The Chief Marketing Officer/Co-founder, Kola Lawal, added, “Our distribution will expand as we have now designed a robust distribution network and made it easy to onboard distributors into a scheme that’s profitable for all stakeholders.”
