A group, 2019 Forum of Governorship Candidates in Rivers State, has called on a former chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state, Felix Obuah, to contest for governor in 2023. The leader of the group, Pastor Samuel Ihunwo, told newsmen in Port Harcourt that the call became necessary after due consultations with relevant stakeholders. Ihunwo described Obuah, who is currently the Sole Administrator of the Rivers State Waste Management Agency, as a detribalised leader. He further said Obuah has the capacity and vision to sustain the legacies of Governor Nyesom Wike in line with the new Rivers State vision, and take the state to another level. He described Obuah as a selfless and generous leader who puts the interests of others above personal interests. The forum’s leader said during Obuah’s tenure as the PDP chairman, the party won over 90 per cent of all elective positions during the 2015 and 2019 general elections, as well as the local government elections. He, therefore, called on the people and residents of the state to join their voices in persuading Obuah to yield to the call. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
