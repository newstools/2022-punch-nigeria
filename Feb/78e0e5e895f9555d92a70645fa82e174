A public health physician and sex educator, Dr. Yemi Adeyemi said using Vaseline as a lubricant during sexual intercourse increases the risk of yeast infection and vagina irritation. Dr. Adeyemi also cautioned that Vaseline is not safe for the vagina health, adding that using it increases the risk of getting a sexually transmitted infection and unintended pregnancy. According to her, Vaseline is oil-based and can destroy latex-made condoms and cause condom failure. Speaking in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise, Adeyemi said “Vaseline is oil-based, which makes it unsafe as a lubricant. Oil-based lubricants destroy latex-made condoms which can lead to an increased risk of getting a sexually transmitted infection and unintended pregnancy. “Using Vaseline as a sexual lubricant would also affect vagina health, cause a yeast infection, vagina irritation, among others.” The physician said the lubricant individuals should opt for should be non-scented water-based lubricants. “Water-based lubricants are the most common and come in two varieties. There is one that comes with glycerin and another without glycerin. “Water-based lubricants are cost-effective, easy to find, safe to use with condoms and less likely to cause vagina irritation (glycerin free) and have a longer shelf-life. “However, lubricants with glycerin may cause yeast infections; glycerin-free lubricants can taste bitter, it may not be the best option if you like to switch things up between oral and penetrative sex,” Adeyemi said. A study published in Obstetrics & Gyneacology shows that intravaginal insertion of over-the-counter products is associated with an increased risk of bacterial vaginosis. Copyright PUNCH.
