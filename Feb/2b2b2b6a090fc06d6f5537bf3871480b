Kevin De Bruyne and Joao Cancelo returned to the Manchester City starting line-up for Tuesday’s Champions League last 16 first leg at Sporting Lisbon. City boss Pep Guardiola made five changes from the team that thrashed Norwich 4-0 in the Premier League on Saturday. Belgium midfielder De Bruyne and Portugal defender Cancelo were the most notable switches. Cancelo looked set to operate at left-back, with City centre-back John Stones once again playing out of position at right-back. Stones, Cancelo and Aymeric Laporte came into City’s defence, in place of Kyle Walker, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Nathan Ake. De Bruyne and Rodri replaced Ilkay Gundogan and Fernandinho in City’s midfield three. Sporting made three changes from their 2-2 draw with Porto as top scorer Pedro Goncalves, who has netted 13 times this term, was recalled in place of Nuno Santos. Pedro Porro took over for Zouhair Feddal at right wing-back and Joao Palhinha was selected instead of Manuel Ugarte in midfield.
