Thousands of youths, on Saturday, in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, marched across major streets to declare their support for the presidential ambition of Dr Bukola Saraki, the immediate past Senate President. The youth, under the aegis of the Grow Nigeria Youth Movement, converged on the Kwara State Stadium as early as 7am and marched through Taiwo, Unity, Challenge and Post Office areas before stopping at the GRA residence of the former state governor. Addressing the gathering on behalf of Saraki, the state Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party and former Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Babatunde Mohammed, said the action of the youth was in line with the agitation in the North-Central region to produce the President and the consensus on Saraki. Mohammed urged other presidential aspirants in the party to support Saraki, who “has the best credentials and background to unite the country, especially at this time that we are viciously divided.” “Saraki has been trusted and tested, and he has demonstrated capacity with requisite legislative and executive experiences that can return Nigeria to the path of economic prosperity and religious and ethnic unity,” he added. Mohammed said the North-Central remained the only region yet to rule the country and called on other geopolitical zones to rally behind it and Saraki in the spirit of fairness and equity. On his part, the state Coordinator of the Grow Nigeria Youth Network and convener of the rally, AbdulHamid Mohammed, said the movement held town hall meetings with youth across the country as part of its consultation. He said Saraki had the right family, religious and cosmopolitan backgrounds to advance the country’s unity. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
