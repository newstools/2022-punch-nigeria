He stressed “ If all of us cooperate, we shall jointly win in the current efforts at tackling crimes in the state. It is because of this that I implore residents of the state to always avail us with intelligence about criminals in their communities. Together, we shall win the war against crimes in the state.” Dabban paid tributes to his predecessor in office, AIG Sanusi Buba, describing him as “a brother, colleague, and friend we are all proud of, because of his commitment to work and his display of professionalism”.
