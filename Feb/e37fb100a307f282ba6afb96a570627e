Six ‘BBoys’ and six ‘Lockers’ emerged regional finalists in the third episode of the Glo Battle of the Year Nigeria reality TV show aired on GloTV on Saturday. According to a statement on Tuesday, with their victory, the regional winners will head to Lagos where they will take part in the semi-finals and finals of the competition. The statement partly read, “The show opened with mild drama in Abuja as BBoy Off, was almost sent off the competition after he had a fainting fit just before his battle with Bboy Vic. Medics wanted him sent home but an emotional Off had assured them that he could go ahead. Alas, his difficulty breathing and the toll from his fainting spell cost him the prize leaving Lil Vic to proudly announce that “I came, I saw, I conquered. “Bboy Whirlz made easy work of BBoy Jerry as they battled for the top position in Benin. For Whirlz, who dedicated his victory to his mother, his win was proof perfect that he is qualified to lead the Dance Guild of Nigeria as president. “If you have seen the movie 12 years a Slave, then you will understand why BBoy SixGod was ecstatic after he humbled Prym to take the prize in Enugu. After seven years as a dancer, the dark-skinned and well-toned dancer could finally brag that he is not just a dancer but an award-winning one. The Six lockers emerged across the cities and will also be making their way to Lagos for the finals. A stand-out locker was Christiana Gift who emerged winner in Port Harcourt.” Copyright PUNCH.
