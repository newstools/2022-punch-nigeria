The North-East Forum of Secretaries of State Government has expressed worry over the 2018 statistics from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Narcotics which placed the region at a 13.6 per cent drug prevalence rate. Its Chairman and Secretary to Gombe State Government, Prof Ibrahim Njodi, in his presentation, expressed sadness over the figures, stressing that it may have increased due to the number of years since the survey was conducted. Njodi said, “The statistics are glaring for Nigeria and the region. A United Nations Office on Drugs and Narcotics Nigeria Drug Use survey in 2018 revealed that one in four drug users is a woman;one in seven persons aged 15 to 64 years had used drugs other than tobacco and alcohol. “Highest levels of drug use is among those aged 25 to 39 years; one in five persons who had used drugs is suffering from drug use disorder. “In the North, the North-East has the highest prevalence rate of 13.6 per cent (over three million people) which is disturbing and we have to note that this is in 2018. It is not in doubt that the figure may have increased significantly.” Njodi, however, said he the forum would present deliberations of the forum to governors in the region. Copyright PUNCH.
