As part of the global celebration of International Mother Language Day, Jehovah’s Witnesses in Nigeria have highlighted their contribution to the growth of Nigerian languages. The International Mother Language Day was first announced by UNESCO on 17 November 1999 but was formally recognised by the United Nations General Assembly in 2002 with February 21 set as the day to commemorate languages across the world. According to a statement by the group’s spokesperson in Nigeria, Olusegun Eroyemi, Jehovah’s Witnesses noted that “there are over 600,000 video and audio materials that are provided in a variety of languages on subjects like: How to Break Free From Drug Addiction; Maintaining Commitment in Your Marriage; Am I Ready to Date? Is This Person Right for Me? The Best Help for Those Who Grieve; Is Life Worth Living When Disaster Strikes? Coping with Pandemic Anxiety, and many more.” The group stated that it had translated a number of its publications into 31 Nigerian languages, while its official website www.jw.org has been translated into 22 Nigerian languages, without excluding the Nigerian Sign Language. Apart from the commonly spoken languages, the groups added that its publications are available for download for free in other Nigerian languages such as Berom, Como Karim, Ebira, Ejagham, Fulfulde (Nigerian), Igala, Kamwe, Tarok, and Yala. The statement also noted that Jehovah’s Witnesses appreciate the need to reach people’s hearts using their mother tongue, especially regarding their message of hope for the future. The group added that its website is the most translated website in the world with resources available in about 1,052 languages. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
