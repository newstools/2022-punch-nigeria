Those rescued include a 14-year-old boy who was sent on an errand to buy food for workers on site. It was learnt that the boy escaped death by a whisker when he returned to deliver the food. The other survivor was said to be a man sitting at the entrance of the collapsed building. He was rescued following the swift response of the emergency responders.
