Twenty-four hours after the All Progressives Congress inaugurated states’ chairmen of the party including Ogun State, the former governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, has calmed the nerves of his loyalists. Amosun on Friday broke his silence on the crisis rocking the APC in the state, saying victory was certain and that he remained in the APC. Amosun’s statement came following the inauguration of Yemi Sanusi as the Chairman of the APC in Ogun State, as against Derin Adebiyi who is his candidate for the chairmanship seat. Sanusi is backed by Governor Dapo Abiodun who is at loggerheads with Amosun over the party’s structure. The Governor Mai Bala Buni-led APC caretaker committee had on Thursday inaugurated the Chairmen of the APC across the States of the Federation. At the inauguration, the national leadership recognised the Sanusi faction loyal to Abiodun. Both Abiodun and Amosun factions had on October 16 conducted parallel state congresses to elect party officials. While Sanusi emerged winner for the Abiodun group, Adebiyi was elected by Amosun loyalists. Contrary to the expectation of some of his loyalists that Amosun would announce his defection, the former governor said he remains in the APC. Amosun, in a terse message on Friday morning, appreciated his followers for their steadfastness. Amosun informed them that the journey continues, adding that victory is certain by God’s grace. He stated “To all our party faithfuls, thank you for your steadfastness. We are APC. APC is ours. The journey continues. Victory is certain by God’s grace. On APC we stand. Thank you and well done to all of you.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
