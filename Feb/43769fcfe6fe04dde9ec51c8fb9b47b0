The Lagos State Government has collaborated with the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency in its efforts to combat incessant flooding in the state. The Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, said this in a statement on Sunday. Bello, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Office of Drainage Services, Mr Lekan Shodeinde, said this during a stakeholders’ meeting held in Ikeja. He said, “The meeting was significant as it addressed the major challenge of the data gap in the water resources sector through baseline data collection and study of flood-prone areas which remain vital to efficient planning and service delivery. “Such information is becoming the benchmark for rain-sensitive states like ours. We also vigorously publicise our activities in flood abatement and mitigation as well as Seasonal Climate Prediction.” The Director-General of NIHSA, Mr Clement Nze, said the agency had commenced plans to mitigate flooding across the country. “To this end, NIHSA commissioned Mecon Geology and Engineering Service Limited to carry out detailed hydrogeological and hydrological studies, as well as flow regimes of major rivers across the country, to mitigate the effects of flooding,” he said.
