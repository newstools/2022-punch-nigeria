The Lagos State Water Regulatory Commission in collaboration with WaterAid Nigeria has unveiled its plans to improve water supply and management of wastewater in the state. The Executive Secretary of LASWARCO, Mrs Funke Adepoju, disclosed this in a statement on Monday, adding that the agency has embarked on a study tour of the National Water Supply and Sanitation Council in Zambia. She said, “The ever-increasing population of Lagos State has undoubtedly put intense pressure on the institutions providing basic social services in the state. However, the state government is sparing no effort in providing affordable and equitable access to clean and safe drinking water for all residents by the administration of Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu. “The visit to Zambia is essentially to study and understand the basic factors responsible for the rapid progress achieved in regulating the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene sector of the country in recent times, especially how the country responded to its WASH crisis, the steps taken to turn around their water supply and sanitation crisis, the models applied, sources of funding, challenges faced and lessons learnt.” The Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Office of Drainage and Water Resources, Mr Lekan Shodeinde, commended the level of dedication from the enforcement arm adding that regulation will positively impact service delivery in the state.
