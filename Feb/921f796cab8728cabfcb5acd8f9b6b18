Ned Nwoko, husband to Nollywood actress, Regina Daniels, has broken the silence over his rumoured marriage to new wife. In an Instagram post on Sunday, the billionaire noted that the rumour was fake news as he called on the general public to stop spreading such stories. He noted that if he wanted to get married, it would not be done in secrecy. “Ned Nwoko marries another wife; this is fake news and you shouldn’t help to propagate it. lf I want to marry,it will not be done in secrecy,” Nwoko said. The former member of the House of Representatives also threatened legal action against using his name to gain followership and spread false news. Nwoko said, “There is a particular group of little minded faceless individuals who believe they can gain followership in the social media by using my name to create sensational news every week. “I will keep being law abiding and reporting the miscreants to the police for appropriate actions. “When such misguided individuals are arrested, don’t accuse me of using the law against them.” Copyright PUNCH.
