Immediate past chairman of the All Progressives Congress in Plateau State, Letep Dabang, on Tuesday formally left the party to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party. Dabang, who was removed as the APC chairman under controversial circumstances in June last year, left the party with over 12,000 other members and supporters including a former Assistant State Secretary of the APC, Binkur N. The defectors were received by the PDP leaders at a rally organised for them at the Langtang North Township stadium on Tuesday. Speaking at the rally, Dabang said he and other defectors decided to leave the APC in order to rescue the state from the poor performance of the ruling APC administration. Dabang said, “APC is not a quality party. I want to call on all right thinking persons of Plateau state who are still in APC to return to the PDP for good. PDP will take over the state in 2023. “I have full assurance that PDP will win, because I don’t have any doubts in my mind. The two forthcoming by-elections, PDP will win them. Plateau people will say bye bye to APC”. The State Chairman of the PDP, Christopher Hassan, applauded members of the group for taking the bold step to return to the PDP which he described as the mother political party in the state. Hassan assured that the party would always welcome such persons with open arms. He added that in the next few weeks, there will be another rally in Jos where the national leadership of the party will receive all those who defected from APC to PDP. Hassan then charged the new defectors to remain loyal, steadfast and contribute their ideas and quota towards repositioning the PDP in the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
