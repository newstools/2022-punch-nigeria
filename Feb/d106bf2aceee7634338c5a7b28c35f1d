Announcing her birthday in the early hours of the day, she wrote on Instagram, “I had wanted to write a very long caption, but I decided to make it brief and straight to the point. “Thank you Chukwu Abiama (God Almighty) for making me see this day in sound health. Thank you for the gift of life dear Jesus. Thank you for giving me a supportive and strong FAN_MILLY (sic) that loves me with all of me, a man that loves me with all his heart and lastly, a family that appreciates the little I do for them. “I do not take this unending show of love for granted. It is my birthday, you guys.” Sharing a video of the actress on his Instagram page, Falegan wrote, “Happy birthday my goddess, my hope, my joy, and my happiness. Please be with me forever, my love. My unending love for you is my vision, my hope, my goal, and my soul. Together forever.” In the comment session, his wife replied, “My property is my property. It’s forever daddy. Use love to choke me this night.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
