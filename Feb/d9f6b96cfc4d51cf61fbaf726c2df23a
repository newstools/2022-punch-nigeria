The Bayelsa State Government has returned to Ibom Air, nine months after pulling out of a Memorandum of Understanding it signed with the Akwa State Government for the airline to start commercial flight services at the Bayelsa International Airport. Speaking at the airport, Governor Douye Diri said he was delighted that Ibom Air had started a commercial flight operation at the airport. He said Ibom Air would complement the operations of UNA at the airport, noting that the services of the two airlines would strengthen economic cooperation between states in the South-South of the country. Diri, in a statement on Wednesday, said the UNA as the only airline at the Bayelsa airport, was already being overwhelmed by the patronage of passengers that are increasing daily. The governor hailed the administration of his Akwa Ibom State counterpart, Udom Emmanuel, who he described as a worthy leader that has shown capacity as exemplified by the coming on board of Ibom Air. He said, “It gives me great joy to welcome an airline from the South-South state of Akwa Ibom. The South-South has been in the discourse for years in terms of development and resource control. But our story is changing. “Today, we do not have only one international airport as it used to be. Now we have an airport in all the south-south states. What we are doing here is historic. Last year, we were here in large numbers to welcome the first commercial flight in Bayelsa and this airport was ecstatic.” The Chief Operating Officer, Ibom Air, George Uriesi, said it was a new vista in the relationship between Bayelsa and Akwa Ibom and promised that the carrier would continue to deliver the top-class services the airline is known for.
