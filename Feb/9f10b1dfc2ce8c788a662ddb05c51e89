Mason Greenwood has been removed from FIFA 22 in an update today. After a database update for all platforms including Xbox, PlayStation and PC, the Manchester United striker no longer features in the popular computer game for offline modes. But his FIFA 22 Ultimate Team item is still active and can be swapped on the game’s FUT 22 transfer market, the Manchester Evening News reports. Greenwood, 20, had been arrested on suspicion of rape and assault on Sunday afternoon, having been accused of violence towards an 18-year-old student. Greater Manchester Police were yesterday given more time to question him. It came as United’s most high-profile players, including David de Gea, Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Pogba have appeared to unfollow Greenwood on Instagram, despite following other squad members. Marcus Rashford, Edinson Cavani, Fred and Jesse Lingard are also among those not following the rising star, while club captain Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes are in a group of 18 squad members who, so far, are continuing to do so. Greenwood was detained after distressing pictures and audio circulated on social media alleging he attacked the woman. The images appeared to show her bloodied and bruised. Another post included a voice recording of a conversation between a man and a woman, dated October last year, which purportedly chronicled the woman being attacked. In the wake of the allegations, Nike – the world-famous sportswear giant – released a statement stating that they were ‘deeply concerned’. It was also revealed their connection with Greenwood has been put on hold. A statement read, ‘We have suspended our relationship with Mason Greenwood. We are deeply concerned by the disturbing allegations and will continue to closely monitor the situation.’
