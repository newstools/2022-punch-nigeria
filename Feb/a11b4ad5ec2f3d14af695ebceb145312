Borno State Governor, Prof Babagana Zulum, on Thursday, described as “very scary” some findings submitted to him by a committee he constituted and tasked with conducting basic literacy and numeracy competency assessment of 17,229 local education authority teachers across the 27 local government areas of the state. The state Commissioner for Education, Lawan Wakilbe, presented the committee’s report to Zulum at the Government House in Maiduguri. The committee had engaged academics in the state before and during assessment tests conducted in January 2022, across the local governments. The report revealed that out of 17,229 teachers across the 27 LGAs, only 5,439, representing 31.6% proved competent to teach, while 3, 815 teachers, representing 22.1% are not competent to teach and are not trainable. The report however revealed that 7,975 teachers, representing 46.3% were found not fully competent but trainable. The report also revealed that 2, 389 teachers, representing 13.9% have been teaching without any formal qualification from any institution. A breakdown of the report’s findings across the 27 local government areas showed, from the worst indices, that out of 224 teachers in Abadam Local Government Area in northern Borno, only 14 are competent to teach, as 74 are not trainable while 136 can be trained. The report further said out of Kala-Balge’s 272 teachers, only 21 are competent to teach with 118 not trainable and 133 trainable. The report also showed indices for other local government areas from which Maiduguri Metropolitan Council has the highest number of 396 teachers not trainable, followed by Askira-Uba with 281, not trainable teachers, Chibok-268, not trainable teachers, Bama-246 not trainable teachers and Biu also with 219 teachers who cannot teach.
