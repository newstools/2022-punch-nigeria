The convener of Arise Women, non-governmental Organization, Mrs Siju Iluyomade, has oragnised free COVID-19 vaccination for people around Lagos and environs. Iluyomade, in a statement on Sunday, said the exercise would hold on Wednesday at the Arise vaccination clinic on Victoria Island, Lagos. “The exercise which will be for those that already took the first dose weeks back will also be opened to those that will administer the first dose. The most effective vaccines from Astrazeneca, Moderna and Pfizer are already in place along with the booster shot for people in a very serene environment. “This is another great initiative of the convener, Arise Women, to make sure the effort of the government to address the shortfall in the designation of locations for people to get vaccinated against COVID-19 which has ravaged the world for almost two years. “It will be recalled that the international NGO which has intervened in so many areas to increase the standard of living of Nigerians in terms of support for social amenities and many more, held the last vaccination exercise on December 16, 2021. To make the place conducive and friendly, the Arise team has made provision for food for everyone who comes around to be vaccinated on the day,” the statement read.  Copyright PUNCH.
