The National Youth Service Corps has said it would continue to prioritise the welfare of corps members, saying it remained its cardinal policy thrust. The organisation was reacting to a report that corps members suffer poor healthcare and bear the cost of their treatment. NYSC Deputy Director)Press and Public Relations), Emeka Mgbemena, said, “An inquiry at the NYSC Lagos State Seçretariat or the NYSC National Directorate Headquarters, Abuja would have put the issues raised in the story in proper perspective. “It is pertinent to state that, the scheme always feels empty and saddened whenever a corps member is lost or maimed. It is for that particular reason that the welfare of corps members remains topnotch, and a cardinal policy thrust of the NYSC. “It is apt to put on record that corps members get medical refunds for sums expended on a health challenge. This scenario usually arises when the scheme has not been apprised of a corps member’s medical issue and he goes ahead to spend out of his pocket. “As soon as the corps member applies and it’s verified, he gets paid. For the reinforcement of this policy, and towards ensuring a more holistic and quicker medical intervention, all corps members have been enrolled under the nation’s National Health Insurance Scheme. “The flag-off of this insurance scheme is slated for Friday, February 11, 2022. “The NYSC shall never shirk its responsibility of seeing to the welfare of corps members. The NYSC is always open to inquiries whenever the need arises.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
