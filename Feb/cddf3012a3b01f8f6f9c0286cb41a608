A Kano Chief Magistrate Court sitting at Malam Aminu Kano International Airport, on Monday sentenced a Kannywood actress, Sadiya Haruna, to six months in prison without an option of fine for defaming a colleague, Isa Isa. The actress was charged with defaming Isa in a video which she posted on her social media handles. The Chief Magistrate, Muntari Dandago, said he found the actress guilty on all counts against her. The actress had, in a viral video, accused Isa of being a “homosexual, a bastard and an unrepentant womaniser.” She also alleged that the actor demanded anal sex from her in the viral Instagram post. The chief magistrate further ruled that in case Haruna continues to defame Isa, she would be sentenced to three years in prison. He said the actress had up to three months to appeal the judgment.
