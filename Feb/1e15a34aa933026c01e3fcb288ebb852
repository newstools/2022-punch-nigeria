Forty-eight hours to the bye-election in Ondo State, the Independent National Electoral Commission has distributed the sensitive materials for the election. The bye-election in Akure North/Akure South Federal Constituency in Ondo State would be held on Saturday with six political parties participating in the exercise. The Resident Electoral Commissioner, Rufus Akeju, signed the results sheets for the 408 polling units at the state headquarters of the commission on Thursday, in Akure. The REC explained that he appended his signature on the results sheets to authenticate them and prevent unscrupulous people from reproducing them. He called on the residents of the two local governments, where the election would be held, to go out and exercise their civic duties by voting for the candidate of their choice. The Head of Operations, INEC Headquarters, Yusuf Abdul-Razaak, said the development was to ensure the results of the election from each polling unit was foolproof. Abdul-Razak explained that the REC would “append his signature on the right top corner of the Form EC 8B(II) for uniformity”, noting that “any result sheet from any polling unit that has no signature of the REC would not be accepted.” Speaking on the ballot materials, INEC Head of Operations, Ondo State, Tope Aina, explained that the materials to be used in Akure North Local Government were different from those going to Akure South Local Government.
