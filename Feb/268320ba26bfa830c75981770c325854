THE Managing Director of Edo State Traffic Control and Management Agency, Mr Dennis Oloriegbe, said the agency had sent 52 drivers apprehended for various traffic offences in the state for psychiatric evaluation, and four of them were found to be depressed. Oloriegbe disclosed this during an inspection tour of the agency’s facilities by Governor Godwin Obaseki and members of the state Executive Council in Benin City, the state capital. He said the agency’s Drivers Training Academy had trained over 1,200 drivers, comprising drivers apprehended for serious traffic offences and those within the civil service. Obaseki, during the tour, said the state invested heavily in the agency because of the need to ease traffic management in the state. He said, “Traffic is a major issue for us in the city. We are working very hard with experts on what to do to ease traffic congestion in the state. The leading causes of traffic congestion are practices among drivers, particularly commercial drivers, and people refusing to obey traffic signs. “I am here to make sure that we put facilities in place to train and apprehend defaulters; to see how well equipped the traffic agency is and also understand their challenges.” Obaseki further noted, “In the next few weeks, apart from amending a few bye-laws, we are going to be taking measures to curb recklessness among drivers in the city.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
