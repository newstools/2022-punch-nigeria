In commemoration of his 80th birthday, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, and his wife, Pastor Folu, will commission a dialysis centre at the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Teaching Hospital, Bauchi. The inauguration of the Enoch and Folu Adeboye Dialysis Centre, ATBU Bauchi, would hold on Friday, February 18, 2022. One of the sons of the clerics, Leke, made this known in a Facebook post on Thursday. The centre for the treatment of kidney-related ailments was built by His Love Foundation, the charity arm of the church. The centre has dialysis machines, a 30KVA generator, medical water reverse osmosis purification system, amongst others. The foundation had in the past established the Enoch and Folu Adeboye Dialysis Centre at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu, Ogun State. In 2017, Adeboye commissioned the first intensive care unit at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, while a second facility was commissioned in May 2019 at the Plateau State Specialist Hospital, Jos. The foundation also has an intensive care unit at the Redeemer’s Health Centre Mowe, Ogun State; amongst others.
