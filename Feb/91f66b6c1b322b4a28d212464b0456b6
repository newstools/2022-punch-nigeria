After two consecutive games on the road, Enyimba return to Aba, where they’ll entertain newcomers Niger Tornadoes in a Nigeria Professional Football League match-day 12 fixture on Saturday (today). The People’s Elephant are back in form after winning three of their last four league games, the latest, a 1-0 away win at Sunshine Stars last Sunday. On paper, eight-time champions Enyimba will be expected to run over their 16th-place opponents. The NPFL giants have won three of their last five meetings and have never lost at home to Tornadoes in the league but captain Austin Oladapo says despite their respect for the visitors, their desire is to claim the maximum points. “In football, you need to respect your opponents, but our aim is to continue where we stopped in our last game and get the maximum points on Saturday,” Oladapo told PUNCH Sports Extra. “They (Tornadoes) won their last game, so they will be high in confidence, but all we need to do is show up as well. We also want to make our fans happy by giving them the three points at home.” Tornadoes are coming into the game on the back of a 2-1 win over Katsina United and are also unbeaten in February, having held Lobi Stars 1-1 in Makurdi February 2. Both sides last met in May 2019, with Enyimba emerging 2-0 winners. Currently fourth on the league table, a win for Enyimba will be their seventh of the season and will also elevate them to third on the league table. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
