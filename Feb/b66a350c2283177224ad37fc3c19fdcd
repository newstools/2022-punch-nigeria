Actress, Juliet Ibrahim, has revealed that the reason most guys are trapped with pregnancy is because they propose to women only when they are pregnant. Ibrahim, who explained that the situation was offensive, lamented why it usually never occurred to most guys to propose to their lovers until they got pregnant. She said, “I find it quite confusing and offensive that most guys nowadays will only propose and think of proposing to a woman “only” when she says she’s pregnant. “So, you will be chopping somebody’s daughter for months/years and it won’t click you that she’s a wife material all those months/years but only when she says I’m pregnant you’ll now remember she’s fit to be a wife? “No wonder many guys are getting trapped with pregnancy unandan by these girls that understand men with such a mindset. It is like everyone is playing a game everywhere I turn now. What is happening to this generation? Anyway, what do I know.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
