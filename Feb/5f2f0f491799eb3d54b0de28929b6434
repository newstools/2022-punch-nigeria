The father of the winner of the 2021 NLNG Prize for Nigerian Literature, Professor Isaiah Onyemelukwe, has been killed by gunmen His daughter, Prof Cheluchi, who confirmed the incident to Sunday PUNCH on Saturday, said, “My heart is heavy. It is the hardest thing that Nigeria happed to my father. We don’t even know where we are headed in this country, but I’m glad he lived an exemplary and lesson-filled life will try to put up something tomorrow.” It was learnt that Onyemelukwe, an 88-year-old retired professor of Economics at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, on Friday in Oko, in the Orumba South Local Government Area of Anambra State. Multiple sources said the gunmen blocked vehicles coming from Umunze, Ufunma into Oko, and murdered the professor in cold blood. It was gathered that the operation lasted for more than an hour unhindered. The assailants were also said to have abducted two other individuals whose whereabouts have remained unknown. A Facebook user with the name, moniker Onyi, who shared the news in a post on Nairaland, wrote, “South-East is absolutely going down. My godfather was recently murdered by the marauding killers wreaking havoc on the South-East’s ecosystem. “He was returning to Nanka with his wife from Enugu and decided to follow the Oji-Ufuma-Amaokpala-Oko axis instead of traveling through Awka when he was attacked by the hoodlums. “The previous Bishop of Niger, Bishop J. A. Onyemelukwe, is his cousin. May his soul rest in peace. Amen!” The late professor was a permanent secretary in the old Anambra.
