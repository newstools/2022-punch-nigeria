The Governor of Adamawa State, Ahmadu Fintiri, has presented the state’s National Youth Service Corps Merit Award to four corps members for their outstanding performances during the service year. Fintiri made the presentation at the Passing Out Parade of the 2021 Batch ‘A’ Stream 1 corps members, on Thursday in Yola. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the awardees, Mark Ozugbo, Aliu Oyindamola, Yunusa Ikoh and Olorun Shola, received the award for their outstanding community development services. Fintiri who was represented by the Commissioner of Youth, Aloysius Babadoke, said the service year had exposed the corps members to the realities of life and equipped them adequately for the future. He congratulated the outgoing corps members and urged them to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors in the area of skills acquisition to be self-employed and job creators. “On behalf of the good people of Adamawa, I deeply appreciate your contributions to the overall development of the state, particularly in the areas of education, healthcare, agriculture and infrastructure. “As well as selfless spirit and uncommon patriotism exhibited in the discharge of your responsibilities in your respective places of primary assignment and host communities,” the governor said. The NYSC Coordinator in Adamawa, Ibrahim Tukur, implored the outgoing corps members to remain good ambassadors of the scheme and responsible role models to other youths. He urged them to avoid all forms of social vices, especially the get-rich-quick syndrome which has landed so many in prison. “I must hasten to add here that you have got to work hard, put your trust in God, and He shall surely bless and crown your efforts with success,” he said. Tukur commended the state government and all stakeholders for their contributions to the success of the scheme in the state. (NAN)
