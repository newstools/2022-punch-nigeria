The Federal Government on Friday arraigned the Chairman of Human and Environmental Development Agenda, Olanrewaju Suraju, for allegedly cyberstalking a former Attorney General of the Federation, Mohammed Adoke. Suraju was arraigned on amended two counts before Justice Binta Nyako at the Federal High Court Abuja. In count one of the charge marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/370/2021, Suraju was accused of intentionally circulating the audio record of a telephone interview between one Ms. Carlamaria Rumur, a reporter with RIAReporter in Italy and Mohammed Adoke via his Twitter handle @HEDAagenda. The prosecution claimed that Suraju knew that the audio record was false and he circulated for the alleged purpose of causing insult to Adoke. The prosecution alleged that the HEDA Chairman acted contrary to Section 24 of the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention ETC) Act 2015 and was liable to be punished under the same section of the Act. In the second count, the defendant was accused of similarly circulating the same audio record via the Facebook handle @HEDAResourcecentre. While Salihu Bagudu from the Office of the AGF announced appearance for the prosecution, Muiz Banire (SAN) appeared for the defendant. When the charges were read to him, Suraju pleaded not guilty. Following an application by his lawyer, Justice Nyako admitted him to bail in the sum of N7m. The judge said a cheque for the sum should be deposited with the court’s registrar, being the highest fine for the offence. The matter was adjourned till May 10, for hearing.
