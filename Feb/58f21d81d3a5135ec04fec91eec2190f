Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, has set up a seven-member committee to investigate the circumstances that led to the recent violence on the wearing of Hijab at Oyun Baptist High School Ijagbo in Oyun local government area of the state. The violence which allegedly occurred at the gate of the school between Muslim and Christian adherents reportedly led to the death of one person while 11 others sustained various degree of injury. A statement signed by Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Rafiu Ajakaye, said that the chairman of the committee is the pioneer Provost of Kwara State College of Health Technology and currently a Director at the National Open University of Nigeria, Shehu Omoniyi, while the co-chairman of the panel is the Secretary General of Ijagbo Descendants Progressive Union, Emmanuel Fatola. Other members of the panel include Christian and Islam patriarchs and matriarchs. The statement charged the panel to establish the roles of every person involved, and recommend to the state government what steps to be taken to avoid a reoccurrence in the future. “The panel will invite and listen to all the parties (including leadership of the school), establish the truth of what happened and the roles of various persons involved, and make recommendations to the government on how to prevent such unfortunate situation in the future,” the statement said. It added, “The committee has three weeks (counting from the first day of sitting) to submit its report to the government.” The government urged the people of the community and every party involved in the Hijab issue to cooperate with the committee and give peace a chance.
