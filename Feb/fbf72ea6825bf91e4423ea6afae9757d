Hundreds of students of the Adekunle Ajasin University Akungba Akoko, Ondo State trooped out of their campus to protest against the incessant road accidents in the town, involving trucks. The protest was ignited by the death of one of their colleagues, who was simply identified as Michael on Thursday evening by a trailer. It was gathered that after killing the deceased, the driver of the truck attempted to run away but was arrested and handed over to the police in the community. The protesters gathered in front of the school gate, barricading the Owo-Ikare Akoko expressway, chanting various solidarity songs. At the time of filing the report, the protest was ongoing while the security men were around trying to make the road free for the motorists. Details later… Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
