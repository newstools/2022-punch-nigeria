With a little over three weeks until the All Progressives Congress National Convention, the Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee has swung into last-minute efforts to resolve the ongoing crisis in its Kano Chapter. Earlier, The PUNCH reported that some party stakeholders led by former Kano State Governor Ibrahim Shekarau have locked horns with another faction loyal to the incumbent governor, Abdullahi Ganduje. The Director General, Press and Public Affairs to the Caretaker Committee Chairman, Mamman Mohammed, disclosed details of the latest efforts in a statement he signed late Tuesday titled ‘APC Kano reconciliation meeting progresses’. According to him, “Stakeholders of APC in Kano state today met at the Yobe Governor’s Lodge in Abuja in continuation of the reconciliation of differing interests in the state. “The meeting was chaired by the Chairman Caretaker Committee and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni. Senators Ibrahim Shekarau, Barau Jibrin, Kabiru Gaya, Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Hon. Alhassan Ado Doguwa and some state government representatives were in attendance. “Participants expressed satisfaction with the approach and remained optimistic that all differences would be settled.” Copyright PUNCH.
