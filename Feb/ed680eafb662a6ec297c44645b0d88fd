And we are back with our news review show, So This Happened. In this episode, we couldn’t help but talk about the spate of ritual killings in the country. The Ondo State Amotekun arrested one suspect, Timothy Odeniyi with body parts. While Odeniyi denied killing the deceased, he claimed that he merely decapacitated the body for the parts a former boss of his requested. Now, this is where it gets interesting. While some are being killed for their body parts, the Majority Leader in the House of Representatives, Alhassan Ado Doguwa is focused on having 30 children before the 2023 general elections. That’s next year. With four wives, think he can achieve it? Moving on to the story of Tallest, a suspected bully, said to be terrorising students of the Federal University of Technology, Akure. He literally met his waterloo during the week and the students gave him a taste of his own medicine, before handing him over to security operatives. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
