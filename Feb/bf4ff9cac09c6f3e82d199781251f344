The Federal Government is expected to pay off five promissory notes worth N311.73bn, which will all mature in 2022. While payment for three promissory notes will be made to state governments, the remaining two will be made to judgement creditors. This is according to a document titled, ‘Schedule of promissory notes issued by category as of December 2021’, which is available on the website of the Debt Management Office. According to Investopedia.com, a promissory note is a debt instrument that contains a written promise by one party (the note’s issuer or maker) to pay another party (the note’s payee) a definite sum of money, either on-demand or at a specified future date. The first promissory note to mature this year is worth N277.90bn. It was issued to state governments on April 1, 2019, and will mature on April 1, 2022. The second is worth N8.78bn, and was issued to state governments on May 24, 2019. It is expected to mature on May 24, 2022. The third is worth N 6.04bn, and was issued to state governments on December 23, 2019; it will mature on December 23, 2022. While the first three are naira-denominated, the remaining two are dollar-denominated. Our correspondent used the official exchange rate of the Central Bank of Nigeria as of February 2, 2022, (N416.04/$) for the dollar-denominated debt. The fourth promissory note to mature this year is worth $3.79m (N1.58bn). It was issued to judgement creditors on August 11, 2021, and will mature on August 11, 2022. The fifth is worth $41.90m (N17.43bn). It was issued to judgement creditors on September 27, 2021, and will mature on October 15, 2022. A total of 43 promissory notes were issued between 2018 and 2021, with 12 issued in 2021 to only judgement creditors. Sixteen promissory notes have matured while only five will mature this year. The document further showed that N1.36tn promissory notes have been issued, with an outstanding  N762.54bn for naira denominated notes; $449.22m promissory notes have been issued and are still outstanding for dollar-denominated notes; and £133.76m promissory notes have been issued and are still outstanding for Euro-denominated notes. A different document titled, ‘Federal Government domestic debt stock by instrument as of September 30th, 2021’ on the DMO’s website shows the total promissory notes debt of N795.27bn. The Federal Executive Council had reportedly approved the establishment of a Promissory Note Programme for the settlement of an estimated N3.4tn local and contractual debt obligations inherited by the government. The debts include outstanding pension liabilities (N400bn); unpaid salaries and third-party deductions (N24.95bn); staff claims (N270bn); part of contractors claims (N45.36bn) and fuel supply accrued interest and foreign exchange differential for petroleum products marketers (N514.29bn). Others include part payment of state governments claims (N487.85bn); outsourced liabilities for the Federal Ministry of Health (N9.04bn); major contractors (N596.51bn); Export Expansion Grant Scheme (N350.12bn); judgement debt (N112.96bn) and those for the electricity distribution companies (N26.71bn), and their generation counterparts (N495.67bn). In December 2018, the National Assembly approved the issuance of promissory notes to two categories of creditors. They include the refund of N488.74bn to 21 state governments for projects executed on behalf of the Federal Government. The refund excluded four states – Bauchi, Delta, Kogi, and Taraba, which were not approved. The other was payment to N348bn to 74 oil marketing companies for fuel supply accrued interest and foreign exchange differentials. Section 4 of the Government Promissory Notes Act states that government promissory notes are paid from the general revenue and assets of the federation. It read in part, “The principal sums and interest represented or secured by any Government promissory notes are hereby charged upon and shall be payable out of the general revenue and assets of the Federation.”  Copyright PUNCH.
