The abductors of a nursing mother, Khadija Audu-Ardo, and her baby have contacted her family and demanded N1.5 million as ransom before releasing them. They were kidnapped at Tsamiya village of Boi, Bogoro Local Government Area of Bauchi State on Monday night. The Chairman, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, Bogoro LGA branch, Idi Wakili confirmed the development to journalists on Friday night. He said, “Yes we have been in touch with the kidnappers. They initially demanded N20 million before releasing them. However, we bargained and they agreed to release the woman and her baby after the sum of N1.5 million is paid.” On the safety of the woman, Wakili said “so far the kidnappers have assured us that the woman and her baby are in their custody and that they are all doing fine. I want to appeal to members of the public to pray for the safe return of the woman.” Wakili called on the Fulani community in the area to be more security conscious and report any stranger to the appropriate authorities.
