Parents of the pupils at the Wuiwui Community Primary School in Gombe State have threatened to boycott the 2023 general elections over the government’s neglect of the school for many years. The school which was established in 2000 with over 150 pupils has no classrooms, toilets or library. Pupils now learn under trees and in the open field. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
