The Asaba Community has called on Governor Ifeanyi Okowa to respect their king, the Asagba of Asaba, Prof. Chike Edozien. The protesters carried placards with various inscriptions such as ‘Respect Asagba of Asaba’, ‘Don’t insult Africa’s oldest living Professor of Medicine’, ‘Our King, our land is our heritage’, and ‘Please, Delta leave our land’ among others. Speaking on behalf of the protesters, the Chairman Agu-Na-Ugboma Land Committee, Mr. Chukwumeka Nwosa, called on the Okowa-led government to respect Asagba of Asaba. He said, “We are here with two issues, one is to tell the governor that we are aware of the issue between the government and our king, Asagba of Asaba. “We want to urge that our monarch should be respected. We don’t have two kings in Asaba, only one who is Asagba of Asaba and no other. “The second issue is to tell the governor to leave our land for us to enable our generation have a place of theirs.” One of the cabinet members of the Asagba of Asaba, Obi Amuwah Obajanma, said the community had ceded about 90 per cent family land to the government over the years. He frowned at the manner the government brought Chinese companies to “illegally and forcefully” acquire over 7, 000 hectares of land belonging to the Agu-Na-Ugboma family. Addressing the protesters, the Chief of Staff, Government House, Mr. Festus Agas, commended the peaceful manner of protest. He said, “I want to assure you that Asagba of Asaba is one of the respected king and Okowa will not do anything to undermine the revered monarch.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
