A group in the ruling All Progressives Congress has canvassed support for a former Governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Tanko Al-Makura, to be the National Chairman of the party. The group under the auspices of the National Committees of APC Support Groups for Senator Umaru Tanko Al-Makura described the former governor as a unifier in the party who would deliver the mandate of APC at the general elections. Speaking in Akure, the Ondo State capital, the Coordinator of the group in the South-West, Princess Bukky Oluderu, said Al-Makura had over the years exemplified remarkable leadership roles needed to lead the party. She added that the senator was the best option to lead the party. She said, “Our decision to adopt Senator Tanko Al-Makura as the next APC National Chairman was not far-fetched; it was based on his track records, credibility, love for his people, and integrity possessed by the person of Senator Umaru Tanko Al-Makura. “He has over the years exemplified remarkable leadership roles devoid of tribalism, religious sentiment, and bias. Hence, part of our resolve is to give him the required support, canvass for votes, and ensure that he emerges as the APC National Chairman. “Our party, APC deserves a leader that has human feelings and is passionate about transformation and development of our beloved country, Nigeria.” Copyright PUNCH.
