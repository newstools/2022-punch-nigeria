A Presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, Sam Ohuabunwa on Sunday said he wants to be President to get the country working for everybody, especially the youths and children yet unborn. Ohuabunwa stated this when he visited the Taraba State chapter of the PDP in Jalingo as part of his nationwide consultations ahead of the 2023 presidential elections. The former president of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria lamented the low life expectancy, poverty, corruption, and the bad image of Nigeria before the international community and pledged to get the country back on track and make life better for everyone if given the chance. He said, “I enjoyed the benefits of this country growing up. We were on scholarships, we were giving car loans. Young people were choosing jobs to do. But today, the country is not working for everybody, especially the youths. “This was not the country my father left for me. It was a better Nigeria, so it makes me wonder what will happen to my grandchildren. Everything has turned very bad under this administration,” he lamented. Responding, the state Chairman of the party, Col. Kefas Agbu (retd.), represented by the Secretary, Mr Tafarki Kuriya, said the aspirant possessed the credentials to be Nigeria’s next President. “We have never seen a presidential aspirant with an inbuilt knowledge and analysis about Nigeria and how to build a better nation like Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa. “You stand a better chance to save this country and we want to assure you that we will work with you,” he assured.
