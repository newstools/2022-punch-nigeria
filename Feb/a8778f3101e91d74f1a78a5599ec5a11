Egyptian defender Mohamed Abdelmonem says Cameroon legend Samuel Eto’o’s remarks prior to their Africa Cup of Nations semi-final clash against the hosts spurred the Pharaohs to victory on Thursday, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Egypt are aiming for a record eighth AFCON title after defeating Cameroon 3-1 on penalties after full and extra time ended goalless. Eto’o, who was elected President of the Cameroonian Football Federation last December, while delivering a speech to his players after their quarter-final win over The Gambia in the dressing likened their semi-final clash with Egypt to ‘war’. “We were so tired during the game, but we all did what we had to do,” Abdelmonem said during the post-match conference. “God willing, we will do everything we have to do in the final match against Senegal to win. “We were playing the hosts and going into extra time was very difficult. Samuel Eto’o’s words before the game motivating Cameroon in the dressing room was a positive for us. “We have the best player in the world, Mohamed Salah, and he always gives us advice, tells us what to do, advises us to take the pressure off our shoulders.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
