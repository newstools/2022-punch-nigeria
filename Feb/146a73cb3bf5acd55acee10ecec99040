Aminu Bello, the younger brother of the Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello, alongside other popular politicians have defected from the All Progressive Congress to People’s Democratic Party. Those who defected from the APC have been welcomed into the PDP while obtaining the party membership cards by their ward party chairman. The ward chairman of Kontagora Central, Umar Hassan, who presented their party membership cards to them said people were bound to leave the APC as a result of their unremarkable performance. He said,“ It is only a matter of time for those in the APC to realize the non performance of the government and start to move to the PDP. “The incompetence, cluelessness and ineptitude of the APC is enough reason for their members to leave the party.” In his remarks, the PDP Zonal Chairman of Niger North, Yahaya Abdullahi, welcomed the governor’s brother and his followers into the party, charging them to work towards the PDP’s development and success. “You are welcome, we also welcome all of you who have decided to join the PDP. Make sure you study the party’s constitution and work hard for the development of the party,” Abdullahi said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
