The Chartered Institute of Administration says it has elected a new President/Chairman of Council. According to a statement by the professional body, the election held in line with the provisions of the institute’s enabling law, which sees a new president take over the baton of leadership of the institute triennially. The statement said the new President, Dr Festus Oshoba, was sworn in at an investiture ceremony in Lagos, recently.  The ceremony was held alongside the institute’s Annual General Meeting, and the induction of 170 new members. In his speech, the outgoing President, Mr Samson Olopade, congratulated the inductees for joining the league of professional administrators and urged them to adhere strictly to the institute’s code of ethics while carrying out their duties as professionals. Reacting to his investiture, Oshoba thanked the governing council and members of the institute for the honour bestowed on him, and for the rare opportunity to serve. He promised to carry members along in all his endeavours as president/chairman of council of the institute. He sought their cooperation in the advancement of professional administration, for the good of the society, the country and the world at large. According to the statement, Oshoba is a practising medical doctor and ophthalmologist with over 45 years’ experience in the medical profession. He is a retired chief consultant ophthalmologist with the Lagos State Government, and a former registrar, Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
