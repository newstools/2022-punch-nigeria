Fishermen in Ini-Ikwe, a fishing settlement in Onna Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, on Tuesday raised the alarm over incessant attacks by gunmen. They alleged that armed men cut off a fisherman’s hand and stole seven outboard engines within one week in the area. The group’s spokesman, Mr Ernest Charlie, stated this while complaining to the local government’s chairman, Iniabasi Ekanem, on Tuesday. “Last week, gunmen collected six outboard engines from us and even cut off our friend’s hand during the attack. “Just yesterday, one out board engine was stolen again in our community. We need the government to help us beef up security in this area to stop gunmen from further attacking us,” Charlie said. He lamented that outboard engines cost about a million naira each. “Our source of business in the community is dying because of insecurity in our waterways; the state government should please come to our rescue. “Gunmen are terrorising us on our waterways and our safety is not guaranteed,” he said. He appealed to the state governor, Udom Emmanuel; and the local government chairman to deploy surveillance boats to curtail the gunmen’s attacks. “We no longer go out for fishing again as a result of the attacks,” he concluded. Responding, the local government chairman, who was represented by the council’s Dean of Supervisors, Mr Phillip Ambrose, sympathised with the fishermen. He said the council was collaborating with security agencies to improve security situation in the area. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
