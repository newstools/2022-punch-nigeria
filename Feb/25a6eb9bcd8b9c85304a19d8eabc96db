Three suspected kidnappers have been shot dead by security operatives comprising the police, military and vigilantes at Okwo road, Ehor community, in the Uhunmwode Local Government Area of Edo State. The suspects had reportedly taken over the busy highway on Tuesday, but were driven into the forest by security operatives, who engaged them in a gun battle. Three of the hoodlums, however, met their Waterloo when they dared the operatives on Wednesday. The gunmen were said to have laid ambush for travellers plying the road, but were overrun by the operatives. Travellers plying the road were held for several hours, while the operatives engaged the hoodlums in a shootout. PUNCH Metro gathered that an unidentified young man, who was driving a Lexus SUV, was hit by a stray bullet in the shoulder. The state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Kontongs Bello, confirmed the incident to our correspondent in a telephone interview. He said, “It happened yesterday (Tuesday) at 06.20am, at Okwo in Ehor area. But the combined team of the police and the military foiled the attempt. Nobody was kidnapped; one person, a young man driving a Lexus 350, was hit in his car in his shoulder. “Meanwhile, today (Wednesday), the hoodlums came out again and three of them were gunned down by a combined team of the police, military and vigilantes.”  Copyright PUNCH.
