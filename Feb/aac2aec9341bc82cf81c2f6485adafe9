Foremost human rights group and civil society organisation, Amnesty International, had demanded for the rescue of Leah Sharibu, who has been held in Boko Haram for four years. On Saturday, which marked exactly four years (1377 days) after Leah was being held captive in Boko Haram captivity, the CSO urged the Federal Government to use all lawful means to rescue abducted persons. Today it is exactly four years since Leah Sharibu and over 100 school girls were abducted from their school in Dapchi, Yobe state, Nigeria. In a statement titled, ‘Leah Sharibu: Four years in Boko Haram Captivity,’ Amnesty stated that the military has failed in its rescue efforts. The statement read, “Leah Sharibu and her schoolmates were abducted because Nigerian security forces failed to act on advance warnings that a convoy of Boko Haram fighters was heading towards Dapchi. “Amnesty International’s investigation shows that the military failed to respond while Boko Haram conducted an armed raid on the Government Girls Science and Technical College in Dapchi, Yobe state, on 19 February 2018 in an assault with chilling echoes of the infamous Chibok girls’ abduction of 2014. “As a greater priority, the government must use all lawful means at its disposal to ensure that Leah Sharibu and all persons abducted by Boko Haram are rescued.” Copyright PUNCH.
