The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has congratulated the Republic of Senegal on its victory at the just-concluded African Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Buhari spoke on Thursday when he received the Ambassador of Senegal, Babacar Ndiaye, in a farewell audience at the State House, Abuja, asking him to convey the congratulations of Nigeria to President Macky Sall, on the resounding victory of the Teranga Lions at the AFCON tournament. Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, disclosed this in a statement he signed on Thursday titled, ‘President Buhari bids Senegal Ambassador goodbye, congratulates country on AFCON victory’. “I’m sending the congratulations reluctantly because our own country got beaten in the tournament,” the President jocularly told the diplomat. He lauded Ndiaye for a successful tour of duty in Nigeria, which lasted almost four years, and observed that “our relationship is very strong. I congratulate your President for keeping the country together. Please, extend my best wishes to him.” Buhari also wished the outgoing Ambassador success in his next tour of duty. On his part, the outgoing Ambassador said Nigeria was like a second home to him, having first served in the consular section of his Embassy before he returned as Ambassador for almost four years. “Thanks for the success of my term. I will always have good memories of Nigeria,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
