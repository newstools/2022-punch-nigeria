The Senate has called on the Federal Government to declare a state of emergency on federal roads as a matter of urgency. Also, the Senate urged the government to immediately offset its indebtedness to the Federal Roads Maintenance Agency in order to enable the agency to carry out its primary responsibility of rehabilitating federal roads, especially with the recent hike in airfares. These resolutions were based on a point of order raised by Senator Gershom Bassey to draw the attention of the Senate to the recent increase in airfare and its implications for Nigerian roads. Bassey decried that airfares for local flights in Nigeria had risen by 63 per cent in response to a spike in the price of aviation fuel and the attendant costs of operation. According to the lawmaker, economy class tickets on local airlines now go for about N80,000 for a one-hour, one-way flight. He expressed worry that the increase in airfares would increase the pressure on the neglected and dilapidated Nigerian roads and further worsen their state. Bassey noted that FERMA has a budgetary approval of just 20 per cent of the funds the agency requires for the rehabilitation of about 35,000km of federal roads in 2022. He added that about N850bn that was to accrue to FERMA by virtue of the five per cent user charge on the pump price of petrol, diesel, and international vehicle transit charges provided for in Section 14 of FERMA (Amendment) Act No.18 of 2007, was still being owed the agency by the Federal Government. “The humongous debt owed to FERMA by the Federal Government has hampered the effective discharge of FERMA’s primary responsibility of road maintenance and rehabilitation”, he said.
