The Coalition of Concerned Northern Forum has raised the alarm over the plot by some disgruntled elements to hijack its planned mass action over the lingering scarcity of Premium Motor Spirit, also known as petrol, across the country. The group said it was in possession of incontrovertible evidence that the genuine concern by them over the fuel scarcity could lead to the breakdown of law and order. The group, comprising 25 civil society organisations, said it decided to shelve the planned revolt even as the Federal Government failed to meet their demands. The coalition had handed down a 72-hour ultimatum to the Federal Government to sack the management staff of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company over the fuel scarcity. It also demanded that the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, and the Chief Executive Officer of Nigeria Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, Farouk Ahmed, resign with immediate effect. But in a statement on Monday, jointly signed by its Chairman, Ibrahim Bature, and spokesman, Abdulsalam Kazeem, the group said its call for the removal of the top management staff of the NNPC had been misunderstood by those profiteering from the crisis. The group said it was in full support of the probe of the importers of the adulterated fuel responsible for the current fuel scarcity as ordered by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.).
