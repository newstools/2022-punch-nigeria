The management of the Ikeja Electric on Monday donated medical equipment to the General Hospital, Ifako-Ijaiye, Lagos State. The Chief Executive Officer of the power distribution company, Folake Soetan, said the donation was to put a smile on the faces of sick children and their mothers, adding that the equipment donated would help improve the lives of patients in the hospital. She said, “I am very happy to be here. Today is Valentine’s Day, the season of love and a time to share love. These children are here, they are ill and their mothers are depressed or sad and we thought to just come and put a smile on their faces. “As a caring organisation that takes CSR very seriously, we decided to come and gift the children and also give the hospital equipment that can help improve the lives of these children.” The equipment donated included jaundice treatment lamp with cot and mattress; cotton wool; methylated spirit; examination gloves; surgical glove; kids facemasks and surgical facemasks, among others. The Medical Director of the general hospital, Bamidele Mustapha, while expressing gratitude for the kind gesture, urged members of the public to do more for the hospital. He said, “I am very happy with this donation; yesterday, we also received an ambulance and incubator and we made calls today for people to support us because the government cannot do it alone. “Many patients come into the hospital without money and we cannot watch them die. So, we give them the necessary support. We are always happy with interventions like this; we welcome them and we are looking forward to more of this in the nearest future.” Copyright PUNCH.
