A governorship hopeful, Jamilu Gwamna, has resigned his membership of the All Progressives Congress in Gombe State. Gwamna contested the 2019 election primary in Peoples Democratic Party before defecting to the APC where he joined forces with the Muhammadu Yahaya’s team to win the state’s number one seat. Recall that recently, a House of Representatives member, Yaya Tongo, and 11,000 APC members were said to have dumped the governing party in Funakaye Local Government Area of Gombe State. In a letter dated 1st February 2022, which was addressed to his ward chairman in Jekadafari, Gwamna said he arrived at this decision after consultations with family, friends and associates. Confirming the viral notice, through telephone interview, Gwamna’s media consultant, Dahiru Kera, said the letter was authentic. The letter partly read, “I write with all sense of humility and respect to notify you of my decision to resign from the ruling All Progressives Congress. “I took the decision after wide consultations with my family, political associates and my supporters. “I appreciate all the privileges I enjoyed in the party.” However, Gwamna’s keep mute on his next political move, but there are indications that he may be returning to the PDP.
