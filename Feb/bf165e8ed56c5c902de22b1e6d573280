A man identified as Bright Ekwueme has been arrested by the police for allegedly defiling a five-year-old girl in Rumuekini in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State. The mother of the minor told newsmen in Port Harcourt that she needed protection following a threat to her life. She alleged that thugs were hired to beat her up for reporting the matter to the police, but insisted that she wants justice for her daughter. The child’s mother called on the Government and human rights groups to come to her aid. “I need help from the government. People should help me. Somebody raped my daughter. “The person’s name is Bright Ekwueme. He is in police custody. I have gone to the hospital for examination. I am waiting for the result. “That is why I am calling on the government to help me. I don’t have anybody to help me.” Speaking on the matter, the Chairman for the committee for defense of human rights in Rivers State, Paul Amadi called on the police not to compromise the investigation. “While we are looking forward to the medical report of the abused child, we appeal to the Choba Divisional Police to transfer the matter to the State Criminal and Investigation Department where it will be officially treated,” Amadi stated. When contacted, the acting spokesperson of the state police command, Grace Iringe-Koko, said she has yet to get the report but promised to find out and get back to our correspondent. Copyright PUNCH.
