The Kwara State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps has arrested a 41-year-old fake soldier, Bolaji AbdulKadir, and two others for a series of burglaries in Lakele community, Oro, in the Irepodun Local Government Area of the state. The other suspects are Olalekan Adeniyi (32) and Dare Ajiboye (31). Adeniyi allegedly ran a shop where stolen items were displayed and sold as second-hand or Tokunbo items, while Ajiboye, who claimed to be a disc jockey, also worked as a sales boy at Adeniyi’s shop. The NSCDC spokesman in the state, Babawale Afolabi, said the three suspects and others at large were responsible for numerous cases of burglary and theft in Lakele. He said, “For the past few months, there have been reported cases of burglary and theft in the Lakele area, and the community, in collaboration with NSCDC officers in the area, decided to track down those behind the nefarious acts.” Afolabi said efforts of the community and the NSCDC paid off when some of the stolen items were found at a shop in the community as further investigations revealed that stolen items were being sold at the shop. According to him, items recovered from the shop included Plasma televisions, play stations, CCTV cameras, among others. He said the state Commandant of the NSCDC, Makinde Ayinla, had ordered a discreet investigation into the case, while a manhunt had been launched for other members of the gang. Afolabi said the suspects would be charged to court at the conclusion of the investigation by the command.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
