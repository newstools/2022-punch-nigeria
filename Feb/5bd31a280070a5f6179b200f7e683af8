The Provost of the Nigerian Institute of Journalism, Ogba, Lagos, Mr Gbenga Adefaye, has urged Nigerian youths to run for political positions in the 2023 elections. Adefaye said this in a statement on Thursday. He was quoted to have spoken when a student of the school, Olufemi Ajadi, visited him for a declaration of his presidential ambition in the 2023 election. He said, “I have not encouraged or wished you well because I am the provost of your school, but I have done so as I would do for any patriotic candidate who displayed courage like yours. “Former President of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo, left office as the Head of State at the age of 42; Ajadi’s presidential ambition is a welcome idea which every other youth need to emulate.” The Deputy Provost of NIJ, Dele Omojuyigbe, in the statement, said Ajadi had displayed courage and confidence by declaring his will to run for the position of president in the 2023 election. “There is power in will and Nigeria is going to a level where someone without a popular platform will emerge as the winner of an election. So, it doesn’t matter if people started laughing at you, just be sincerely focused,” Omojuyigbe said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
