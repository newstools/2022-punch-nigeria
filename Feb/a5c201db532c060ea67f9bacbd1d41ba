Ossai Success, an aide to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, has said singer Ikuforiji Olaitan Abdulrahman, popularly known as Oxlade, should apologise over a sextape allegedly involving him. The sextape which has gone viral on social media had many Nigerians hailing Oxlade for the sexual prowess displayed by the male figure believed to be the singer. However, there were some comments criticising the singer who is yet to address the sextape as of the time of filing this report. Reacting, Success, in a post on his Facebook page, said those hailing Oxlade over the video are a corrupt set of people. This is as he cited a sextape involving singer Tiwa Savage which was widely condemned by many Nigerians. He wrote, “Stop praising Oxlade, he should apologise to us. “Praising Oxlade when you condemned Tiwa Savage’s video is abnormal. “You can’t praise Oxlade and condemn Tiwa Savage knowing fully well that Oxlade’s video is not different from Tiwa’s video. “The youths who are hailing Oxlade over that video are a corrupt set of people. “This is the major problem we are having in this country. We love praising wrong things instead of condemning them. “Oxlade’s video is condemnable and he should apologise to us. He is going in a negative direction and it might end up affecting his career. “Condemning a female hmmm video and praising a male hmmm video is totally abnormal. “Let’s learn to condemn genuinely not sentimentally.” Copyright PUNCH.
