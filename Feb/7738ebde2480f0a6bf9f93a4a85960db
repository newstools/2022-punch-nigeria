A former Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Bolaji Abdullahi, has declared his intention to contest the Kwara Central senatorial seat come 2023. Abdullahi made this known at the secretariat of the Peoples Democratic Party in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, on Monday. Presenting his letter of intent to the party’s state chairman, Hon. Babatunde Mohammed, Abdullahi stated that 2023 was an opportunity for leaders who would take the country out of its current problems to emerge. He added that he joined the race to help solve issues such as unemployment and insecurity. Abdullahi said, “Nigeria is, at the moment, faced with numerous problems. Insecurity has assumed an alarming proportion. Nigerians are losing their lives in thousands daily. Most Nigerians are unable to feed themselves, do not have access to healthcare and education. “Nigerian youths have become destabilising force because of our inability to provide jobs for them. Therefore, we need leaders that will take Nigeria out of these problems. “2023 provides us with the opportunity to move the nation out of the doldrums. This is the time for patriotic Nigerians to offer themselves for service. It is in the light of this that I have offered myself for service to our fatherland,” the former Kwara State Commissioner for Education said. Abdullahi served as the Minister of Youth Development under the President Goodluck Jonathan administration. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
