A businessman, Abubakar Barkindo, has admitted to defiling two underage boys in Yola, the Adamawa State capital. The defendant, who had earlier denied the allegation upon his arraignment before a Chief Magistrate’s Court sitting in Yola, on Wednesday, admitted to committing the act, contrary to Section 263 of the Penal Code Law. The court subsequently ordered his remand in a custodial centre. Barkindo, who sold engine oil at a filling station in the state capital, claimed that he recently discovered that his manhood was no longer functional, adding that he complained to his mother about the problem. He said he collected some herbs with a view to treating the sickness and later decided to test if he was OK by asking the boys to play with his private parts. The police prosecutor, Sergeant Sawe Nicholas, in a first information report filed in court, said the defendant committed the offence on February 8, 2022. Sawe told Chief Magistrate Abdullahi Digil that the victims’ father reported the matter to the police. He explained that the defendant lured the boys into his room where he removed his clothes and sexually assaulted the victims, including ejaculating in their mouths. The court adjourned the matter till March 7, 2022, and ordered the police to complete investigation and forward the case file to the Directorate of Public Prosecutions. Copyright PUNCH.
