Rosy Meurer, Nollywood actress and wife to actress Tonto Dikeh’s ex-husband, Olakunle Churchill, has reacted to criticisms following her Instagram birthday post for step-son. On Thursday, the Gambian-born actress drew the attention of critics who slammed her for wishing her husband’s son, Andre, a happy birthday, even while she had no good rapport with his mother, Dikeh. Rosy took to her Instagram page on Sunday and defended herself, stating that her intentions were pure. “At the end of the day, I know that I am a good person,” she wrote in the caption. “I am far from perfect, but my intentions are good; my heart is pure, and I love with everything I have. “Because of these things, I am worth it. Always have been, always will be.” While Dikeh herself has made no comments on the post, her ex-husband came to Rosy’s defence on Friday, saying, “She only made a goodwill post,” adding that critics should “let her breathe.” Tonto and Churchill parted ways in 2017, after two years of marriage and a son together. During the divorce process, Tonto had accused Rosy Meurer of having an affair with her ex-husband, an allegation which she(Rosy Meurer) denied at the time. To the shock of many, Churchill and Meurer tied the knot in 2021, and welcomed a son later in the year. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
