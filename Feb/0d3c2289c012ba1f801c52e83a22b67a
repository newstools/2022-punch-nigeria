In their bid to support the move to address the housing deficit in Nigeria, experts in the real estate industry have urged investors on the need to co-own prime assets through Blockchain technology. According to a statement by Ellamidiate, a recently launched real estate company that leverages Blockchain, the technology offers fractions of verified assets to investors around the world to co-own real estate assets in the United States, United Kingdom, Dubai and Nigeria. The Chief Executive Officer of the company, Damilola Parkinson, was quoted as saying, “In the platform, a regular bank staff, a businessman, and a civil servant can co-own fractions of a prime real estate asset without breaking the bank. Handful investors have used this opportunity to co-own real estate assets in places like Dubai and the UK. Such assets would not disappear, in a market that is stable, and that has constantly performed above the inflation rates.” On how the organisation intends to address issues of bad actors with fake titles, the Ellamediate boss said; “On the platform, a person can purchase real estate assets without fear of bad title, being swindled or having to deal with middlemen or third parties usually associated with the traditional real estate transactions. “This is all made possible through the presence of strategic partners that play a key role in ensuring the safety of transactions, the safety of title, and safety of assets via our platform.”  Copyright PUNCH.
