A civil society organisation, Enough is Enough Nigeria, has launched an awareness campaign ahead of the 2023 general elections. This was announced in its press release on Tuesday titled, ‘2023 Elections: EiE Nigeria Rolls Out #MakeNaijaWork Campaign.’ According to the statement, the 13-month campaign themed #MakeNaijaWork, would serve as a “clarion call to Nigerians to seize the golden opportunity to decide and elect credible leaders by registering to vote and selecting candidates based on defined criteria – courage, compassion, competence, capacity, and character.” The multilayered campaign kicked off on February 2, 2022, with several media engagements, including a Twitter Spaces conversation. Speaking on the core objective of the campaign, the organisation’s Executive Director, ‘Yemi Adamolekun stated, “We spend so much time asking why we are yet to make socio-political progress but the answer is clear: We are yet to strategically occupy our Office of the Citizen. “We are yet to understand that this is the highest office in Nigeria because elected and appointed public servants serve us. They are called public servants for a reason – to serve the public! Elections provide an opportunity to determine our servants!” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
