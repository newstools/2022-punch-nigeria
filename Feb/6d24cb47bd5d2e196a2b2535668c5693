THE Segun Oni Movement on Sunday debunked insinuations that a former Ekiti State Governor, Chief Segun Oni, joined the All Progressives Grand Alliance after he defected from the Peoples Democratic Party some days ago. Oni, who contested for the PDP ticket in the January 26 primary election, dumped the party for a yet- to-be disclosed party on February 5 after alleging that his former party disenfranchised his supporters during the exercise. SOM Director of Media and Publicity, Jackson Adebayo, said the rumours that Oni had again moved out of APGA to another party to contest the June 18 Ekiti governorship election was unfounded, saying such was “part of the orchestrated blackmail put together by those who are being haunted by the aspiration of the former governor.” Adebayo, in a statement in Ado Ekiti titled, ‘Oni never joined APGA – SOM’, said, the former governor was waiting for Ekiti people’s decision on the new platform, adding, “The only person that the people could trust with the governance of the state is Engr Segun Oni as evidently displayed at all nooks and crannies of the state.” Although he did not disclose the platform on which Oni would contest in the election, the SOM spokesperson said, “Many political parties approached the former governor to fly their flag in June 18 election, but he didn’t agree to join any due to the ongoing wide consultations. “Some stakeholders in Ekiti project did approach to convince Oni on reasons he should agree to contest on APGA’s platform, but he declined. Oni’s position is that the people of Ekiti State would come up with a party they love before the close of the window,” the statement clarified.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
