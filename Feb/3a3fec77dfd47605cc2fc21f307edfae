Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, on Saturday described the death at age 79 years of the retired Bishop of Lagos West Anglican Diocese, Dr Peter Adebiyi, as a colossal loss. Fayemi said the death of Bishop Adebiyi, an indigene of Osi Ekiti in Ido Osi Local Government Area of Ekiti State, was “shocking and unexpected”, saying, “He was one of Ekiti’s finest, a worthy Ekiti ambassador and a man of honour”. The governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, titled, ‘Fayemi mourns scholar-priest, Bishop Peter Adebiyi’, said, “He was a man of integrity who distinguished himself as a clergyman and an academic. He did not limit himself to the church, he had a second address”. The governor said, “The late scholar-priest was an admirable personality who lived a life of service worthy of emulation. The late Adebiyi’s life was a testimony of a young church organist who many people never expected could become a great clergyman. He was a humble giant through who God did many wonders”. While noting that Adebiyi was a man of integrity and  impeccable character, Fayemi asserted that “the late clergyman jealously guarded that which was entrusted to him by God and the church; leading to the growth of the Anglican Diocese of Lagos West which has no fewer than 270 new churches.
