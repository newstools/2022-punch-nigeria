Nigerian basketball players have urged the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, to resolve the lingering leadership crisis rocking the Nigeria Basketball Federation. The players stormed the office of the sports minister on Tuesday to register their displeasure over the state of basketball in the country. Speaking to journalists, former players’ representatives under the Musa Ahmadu-Kida-led board Ejike Ugboaja urged the minister to be bold and address the issue without sentiments. “The two elections were concluded two weeks ago, and we don’t know the stand of the minister. I served under the Ahmadu-Kida board and I have played the game for more than 12 years, we have never experienced this type of problem before. “I think by today, we ought to have our president and not the ministry running the show. We want the minister to come out and tell us what is going on, we want him to address us, we want the minister as the father of the game to tell us his position.” In his reaction, the present players representative on the board of the NBBF, Stanely Gumut, said basketball players home and abroad had thrown their weight behind factional president Igoche Mark. “We don’t want to repeat the mistake we made four years ago. Our fight is about players’ welfare. The truth of the matter is that we the players have thrown our weight behind Igoche Mark.”
