The Senator representing Osun Central in the Senate, Ajibola Basiru, on Monday declared support for the re-election of Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State. Basiru, while speaking with newsmen in his office in Osogbo, said Oyetola has done enough to be re-elected for another term. He promised to work with other stakeholders and ensure that Oyetola secures APC’s ticket for another term. He challenged anyone interested in APC governorship ticket to come for the party’s primary. “I have my own aspirant who is Governor Gboyega Oyetola and he will succeed during the primary,” Basiru said. He expressed support for the bill against the proliferation and illegal possession of firearms, adding that the bill would be passed without delay. He said, “I am in full support of the bill and if passed, it will assist the country to reduce and possibly put a stop to criminal activities in the country.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
