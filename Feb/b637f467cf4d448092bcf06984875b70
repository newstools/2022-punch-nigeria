President of the Nigeria Football Federation, Amaju Pinnick, has exclusively told PUNCH Sports Extra that the addition of Leicester City forward, Ademola Lookman, to the Super Eagles will offer the team more attacking options ahead of next month’s World Cup play-off clash against archrivals Ghana. On Thursday, the Nigeria Football Federation received the decision of world football-governing body, FIFA, detailing that Lookman could now represent Nigeria at the international level after winning the U-20 World Cup with England. Speaking on Lookman’s switch, Pinnick told PUNCH Sports Extra, “Lookman will bring more purposefulness to the team and more attacking options.” In a general message on Twitter, the NFF boss stated, “Lookman was part of England’s title win at the 2017 U-20 World Cup and brings a winning mentality to our team. I can’t wait to see him make our Super Eagles that more formidable.” Nigeria and Ghana will meet at the Cape Coast stadium on March 24 for the first leg of the World Cup play-offs with the reverse fixture billed for the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja three days later. The Eagles will hope to get Lookman involved in the clash as they look to qualify for this year’s World Cup in Qatar. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
