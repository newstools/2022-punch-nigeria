The United States of America has commenced the construction of support facilities for the recently purchased Super Tucano fighter jets. This is as the US expressed its readiness to assist Nigeria in its efforts to create a more peaceful, prosperous nation. These were contained in a statement on Wednesday by the US Embassy. The ground breaking of the facilities, according to the statement, signalled the final phase of the $38 million construction project for the A-29 Super Tucanos’ support facilities and was performed at Kainji Air Force Base on Wednesday. The statement read, “On February 15, Ambassador Mary Leonard and Brigadier General Thomas Tickner visited Kainji Air Force Base to break ground on the final phase of the $38 million construction project for the A-29 Super Tucanos’ support facilities. “They were joined by the Deputy Director for the Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation Directorate Ronald Taylor and senior Nigerian Air Force officials. “The construction site will be the location of several critical facilities including sunshades to house the A-29 Super Tucanos, munitions assembly and storage areas, and an annex for the A-29 flight simulator. “The US Army Corps of Engineers North Atlantic Division is overseeing the construction of this necessary infrastructure for the operation and maintenance of the A-29 Super Tucanos and their accompanying munitions.”  Copyright PUNCH.
