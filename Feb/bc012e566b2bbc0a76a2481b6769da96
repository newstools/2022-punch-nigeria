SUPER EAGLES goalkeeper Maduka Okoye is in line to make his 50th appearance for the first team of his Dutch Eredivisie club Sparta Rotterdam when they host PSV in Sunday’s (today) clash, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The 22-year-old goalie will also be aiming to keep his 15th clean sheet for Sparta Rotterdam who occupy one of the two automatic relegation places, with two points separating them from the relegation playoff spot, while they are four points adrift of safety. The Nigeria international has made 49 appearances conceding 65 goals and keeping 14 clean sheets for Sparta Rotterdam since he joined the club Fortuna Dusseldorf in 2020. The hosts have won five league games all season, with two of those victories coming against Willem II, who they edged out in their last outing. Sparta holds the worst goalscoring record in the Eredivisie so far this season having scored only 17 goals prior to Sunday’s (today) fixture but will be banking on Younes Namli to help them secure their sixth win of the season. Barring any last injury concerns, Okoye is expected to be named in Nigeria’s squad to face Ghana in next month’s Qatar 2022 World Cup play-off clash. The Black Stars will host the first leg at the Cape Coast stadium on March 25 with the second leg billed for Moshood Abiola stadium in Abuja four days later. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
