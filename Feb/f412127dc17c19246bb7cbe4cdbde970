A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party in Zamfara State, Aminu Umar, has challenged Governor Bello Matawalle to explain to the public how he spent over N31bn allocation he collected in 31 months. Umar insisted that the governor needed to give a detailed explanation on how he utilised the huge amount of money he received as security vote and allocation to his office in 31 months. Umar, who is the Principal Private Secretary to the embattled Deputy Governor of the state, explained that in 31 months of Matawalle’s administration he collected N600m as security vote; N350m as cash allocation for his office; N30m for the office of his PPS and another N30m as cash allocation to the Government House. Umar said, “If the amount is multiplied by 31 months, it will be equal to N31.3bn.” He added, “In the education sector, the governor refused to settle WASSCE and NECO fees, thereby leaving the teaming youths in a state of uncertainty.” But an aide of the governor, who asked not to be named, told Saturday PUNCH that Umar was merely regurgitating baseless old allegations.
