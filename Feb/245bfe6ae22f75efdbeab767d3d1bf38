The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offices Commission has said it uncovered fresh 3,309 employment in 26 ministries, departments and agencies. The commission added that the recruitments were uncovered amidst denials by the respective MDAs. The ICPC stated that it uncovered the state of employment when it sent an inquiry to the Office of the Head of Service of the Federation, Dr Folashade Yemi-Esan, on October 8, 2021. The commission disclosed this in its ethics and integrity scorecard which it made available to our correspondent in Abuja. The report partly reads, “Although all MDAs visited said there was no employment in 2020, responses to request on recruitment from the Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation vide letter ref: HCSF/2031/VOL11 dated 8th October, 2021 revealed that 14 MDAs out of the 26 MDAs that obtained waivers from the office of the Head of Civil Service of Federation to carry out recruitment exercise in 2020 were captured in the deployment exercise. “This reflects a total of 1959 out of 3,309 recruitments approved. However in this survey, all MDAs assessed denied employing staff during the period under review. “Though personnel of these agencies are regularly exiting the system through retirements, resignations, terminations, dismissals, deaths etc, yet the number of personnel keep rising and the wage bill of the government keeps increasing.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
