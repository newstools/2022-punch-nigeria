Operatives of the Umuahia Railway Police Divisional Headquarters, Abia State, have arrested three members of a syndicate, who allegedly specialised in vandalising railway tracks. They were identified as Kelechi Ononiwu, Kalu Egbe, and one Stanley. It was gathered that the men and two others at large vandalised the tracks along the Ameka/Mbom line by removing the rail sleepers and loading them into a black Toyota Hiace bus. Our correspondent learnt that upon the receipt of the information, the Commissioner of Police, Railway Command, Yetunde Longe, deployed policemen in the scene as the five suspects reportedly engaged the operatives in a gun battle. A police source, who confirmed the incident, said one of the suspects sustained gunshot injuries while two others escaped. He said, “Following strong resistance from the police team, three vandals were arrested; one of them sustained gunshot injuries. “The injured suspect is receiving treatment at the Federal Medical Centre, Umuahia, while a search is still on for other fleeing members of the gang.” Longe urged members of the public to partner the police by providing useful information that could curb the menace of vandalism of rail tracks.
