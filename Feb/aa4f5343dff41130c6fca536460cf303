The Publicity Secretary of Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa’s faction of the All Progressive Congress, Bello Bakyasuwa, has called on the security agents to protect their lives against persistent attacks by political thugs loyal to Governor Bello Mattawale. Bakyasuwa, who spoke to newsmen after a session at the Zamfara State High Court in Gusau, lamented how their lawyer and himself were attacked by Matawalle political thugs within the court premises. Explaining that nobody was arrested, he called on security agents to live up to their responsibility. He said the Kabiru Marafa’s faction would henceforth defend themselves if the security agents did not come to their rescue. “I wish to call the attention of the Nigerian security agencies that henceforth, if we are attacked again like this or attempted to be attacked, we will have no choice than to defend ourselves so long the authorities cannot defend us. “We are equally urging the police to as a matter of urgency fish out those behind this attack because we believe they know them,” Bakyasuwa added. Reacting to Bakyasuwa’s claim, the state APC Publicity Secretary, Yusuf Idris, said it was a great lie. Idris described as unfortunate that somebody like Bakyasuwa could be telling lies, stressing that he was in the court and sat side by side with Bakyasuwa and nobody was attacked.
