Bundesliga and second division clubs will have a minute of silence to indicate peace and sympathy with Ukraine ahead of weekend matches, the league (DFL) said on Thursday. “We condemn the attack on Ukraine — and thus on the lives and homes of innocent people,” the DFL said in a second statement, hours after condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms.” “War in any form is unacceptable —- and incompatible with our values of sport,” the DFL said on Twitter. The DFL said it was in contact with other national and international federations. Similar sentiments have been expressed by the German Olympic Sports Confederation (DOSB). (dpa/NAN)
