A consultant Urologist at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, Dr. Oluwaseun Akinola, has said age and urinary symptoms are some of the risk factors for prostate enlargement. In an interview with our correspondent, Akinola said the exact reason for prostate enlargement remained unclear. He said, “There has not been any particular thing that has been identified to cause it. We do know that it runs sometimes in families, so there is some genetic component. We also know that it happens to a lot of men as they grow older. It can go to a point where it starts causing problems, when there is some degree of blockage. Initially, the bladder might compensate for all the blockage; the inner lining starts getting a little more sensitive. “People without a family history can also get it. We believe there are some degrees of imbalance of hormones, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. “The older a man grows the more likely he can have prostate enlargement. The normal prostate is about 25 grammes or the size of a walnut. But over time, it can grow big, up to 200 grammes. In some people it never changes. “Men must know that when they develop urinary symptoms, when they start to urinate more often than before, waking up multiple times at night to urinate, having difficulty while urinating, intermittency in the flow of the urine; those are all symptoms that suggest that something is going wrong with the prostate. Most times it is an enlargement but it is also important to check because sometimes cancer can also present in a similar way. Early detection will save a lot.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
