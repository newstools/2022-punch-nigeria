Nigeria international Wilfred Ndidi could make his 160th Premier League appearance when Leicester City travel to Afield to face Liverpool on match-day 24 of the English Premier League on Thursday. The former Genk midfielder joined the Foxes in the 2016/17 season as a replacement for Ngolo Kante, who joined Chelsea following a stellar performance for Claudio Ranieri’s men, when he guided them to a Premier League title, and the Nigerian has done a perfect job, becoming one of the most sought after midfielders in Europe. The 25-year-old made 17 appearances on his debut season and scored two goals, and became a mainstay in the Leicester team as he missed just five league games the following season. In the 2018/19 season, the midfielder played all 38 league matches for the Foxes, starting all games, except one, where he came up as a substitute. In the 2019/20 season, he appeared in 35 matches but had injuries limit his appearances in 2020/21 to just 27 games in the league. So far this season, the hardworking midfielder has played 13 games, starting all of them. From the 159 league games he had featured in, the midfielder scored seven goals and provided nine assists. Ndidi was part of the Leicester side that won the Emirates FA Cup last season following a 1-0 win over Chelsea at the Wembley Stadium.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
