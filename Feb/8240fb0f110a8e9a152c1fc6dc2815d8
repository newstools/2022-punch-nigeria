The Council of Imams and Alfas in Epe Division has rejected the decision of the Lagos State Government to appoint Sheikh Sadallah Aliru as the Grand–Chief Imam and President General of the Council of Imams and Alfas in the division. The council, in a statement on Monday, said the Chief Imam, Epe Central Mosque, Ita-Opo, Sheikh Abdullateef Oladapo. remained their choice. The President, League of Imams and Alfas, Lekki Local Council Development Authority, Alhaji Mondiu Opeloyeru, in the statement, said Oladapo was unanimously chosen and turbaned as the Grand-Chief Imam and President General, Council of Imams and Alfas, Epe Division at the general meeting of the council which took place at Epe Central Mosque, on February 2, 2022. The statement read, “Chief Imam Abdullateef Oladapo is our Grand -Chief Imam in Epe Division. He was turbaned at the residence of the late Grand – Chief Imam, Sheikh Kolawole Sanni, on May 15, 2020, and we sent letters of this development to all the appropriate quarters in Epe and Lagos State. “But, after six months, we were told by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Lagos State Government that what we did was illegal installation. Afterward, we had a meeting with the Ministry of Home Affairs and we made our position known. It surprised us when they called us to Epe Local Government secretariat a few weeks ago and read out the official letter on the appointment of Sadallah as our new Grand – Chief Imam. “When did the government start intervening in the selection of Grand–Chief Imam? It is our responsibility as the League to choose our President General. When the Grand-Chief Imams of Ikorodu, Badagry and Lagos Island died, the government did not intervene. So, why now? We are not going to work with Sadallah, instead of that, we will rather be on our own and whatever they want to do with Sadallah, they should go ahead.”
