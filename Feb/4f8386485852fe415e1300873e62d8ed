A key battle in the race for a place in the top half of the Nigeria Professional Football League after match-day 15 is scheduled for Monday (today) in Lafia, as Nasarawa United and Niger Tornadoes face off, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Tornadoes are 12th in the NPFL standings with a point adrift 11th place Nasarawa, who have 17 points, to set up a tight top half battle today in Lafia. The Minna-based outfit are on a four-game unbeaten run with two wins and two draws and earning eight points from a possible 12, but Nasarawa are without a win in their last three games, after two draws and a defeat. But they will be banking on their impressive home form to return to winning against the Miners. Bala Nikyu’s side are yet to lose a game at home this season, scooping four wins and two draws of their six league home fixtures in Lafia this term. In fact, Nasarawa are on a 21-game unbeaten home run, with their last home defeat (2-1) on February 3, 2021, against Enyimba. “We did not get a good result in our last game against Enugu Rangers, where we lost 1-0 in Nnewi but we are prepared for this match against Tornadoes,” Nikyu said. “Playing at home in front of our fans will give us more confidence and hopefully with our vociferous fans we will triumph again. They are truly the 12th player. I believe we will win at home.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
