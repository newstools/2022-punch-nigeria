Gunmen have kidnapped a 40-year old woman, Khadija Ardo, of Tsamiya village, Boi, in the Bogoro Local Government Area of Bauchi State. The joint security task force in the LGA, in a statement on Tuesday, said the woman was whisked away with her baby to an undisclosed destination on Monday night. The statement read, “Around 12 noon, villagers reported to our office a kidnap case involving one Khadija Ardo by armed gunmen. “We quickly mobilised our personnel and moved to the community. We are doing everything possible to secure the lives of the woman and her baby.” A resident of Tsamiya village said, “We have been living in fear since the incident happened yesterday (Monday). The gunmen came late in the night and took away Khadija and her baby.” Khadija’s husband, Audu Ardo, said he went to see his cows in one of the nearby villages and decided to sleep there. “I was not at home when they came. I want to appeal to the kidnappers to release my wife and my baby; they are innocent,” he added. The village head of Boi, Bala Likita, described the incident as shocking. He said, “I am shocked that for the first time kidnappers gained access to my domain. May God protect us.” The Chairman of Bogoro LGA, Iliya Habila, said security agents had intensified efforts to ensure the safe release of the woman and her baby. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
