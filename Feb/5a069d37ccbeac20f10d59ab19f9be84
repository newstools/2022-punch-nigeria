The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Sunday, got a comprehensive briefing on the coup attempt to oust President Umaru Sissoco Embalo of Guinea-Bissau, but which was aborted by loyalist forces. This was on the sidelines of the ongoing African Union Summit of Heads of State and Government in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday. According to Adesina, Buhari met with Senior Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Guinea-Bissau, Suzi Barbosa, who gave graphic presentation of the attempt to overthrow the constitutional order in her country. “They attempted to kill President Embalo. They destroyed the presidential palace with bazookas, killed 11 young people. It took about five hours to restore order. It was a nightmare,” she said. Adesina said Buhari pledged to consult with other leaders of the Economic Community of West African States on how full normalcy could be restored to the embattled country at the shortest possible time.
