A fertility expert and chief executive officer of EEK Fertility clinic, Dr Ekinyi Ochete, has said the high intake of alcohol, sugar and unhealthy foods are responsible for low sperm count in men. This is as she advised Nigerians to use alternative medicine and treatment to take care of fertility issues. Ochete gave the charge during an interview with selected journalists in Abuja. She said, “Most men suffer from sperm count issues. This is high in this part of the world because of high intake of alcohol, sugar, unhealthy foods and lack of adequate rest. “For the female, the major challenge is blockage of the fallopian tube, which is caused by underlying infections. Sometimes, it is also a case of personal or medical carelessness. “It is not all conditions that require medicine. There are cases that require eating right and proper detoxification of the system. When people come to me for treatment, the first thing I tell them is to eat right, have good health habits, and rest properly. “Many women conceive while in the detoxification process without treatment. A lot of conventional medicines have been modified, and that is why so many people are suffering. But when we bring in the natural side and give it to them in the raw form, they get results.’’ Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
