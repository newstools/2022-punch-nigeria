THE Ijaw Young Council has condemned the killing of an Okomu Oil worker by gunmen and the destruction of 20 hectares of the company’s rubber plantation in the Ovia South West Local Government Area of Edo. In a statement on Friday, the Western Zonal Secretary of IYC, Mr Olu Derimon, noted that the action of the gunmen was not only barbaric but capable of destroying several families’ livelihoods. The IYC called for a thorough investigation into the incident and asked the security agencies to bring those responsible for the dastardly act. He said, “While we condemn the barbaric act as no man has the right to take the life of another just like that, we want to urge the state government and the security agencies to thoroughly investigate the matter and bring to justice those behind the act. “On the premise of investigation, we want to appeal to security agencies not to harass or intimidate the host communities around Okomu and environs who are lawfully going about their normal businesses. The IYC scribe called for cooperation between the host communities and the security agencies to unravel the identities of those behind the attack on Okomu Oil.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
