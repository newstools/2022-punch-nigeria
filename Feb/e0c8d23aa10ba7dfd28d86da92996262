As the 2023 election approaches and continues to gain momentum in Nigeria, Charles Onyeabor has joined a host of celebrities urging the Nigerian youth to get involved in the process of electing new leaders that are capable of effecting true change to move the country forward. Charles, who is a respected musician resident in Italy and son of Nigerian legendary singer, William Onyeabor, said, “We all want a better Nigeria that works for everyone and the only way to do this is by collectively electing capable leaders. “The election will not hold on social media so it’s important we encourage ourselves to get our voter’s card and this time, be active and deliberate about our choice.” According to the Independent National Electoral Commission, the Continuous Voters Registration exercise resumed the registration of voters on Monday, June 28, 2021, and will be on until September 2022. Nigerians who are 18 years old and above are eligible to register to vote. Onyeabor added, “All over the world, youths play an active role in the election process and I don’t think it should be different when it comes to Nigeria. It’s a good time to be alive and active to our civic roles in the election process.”
