SUPER EAGLES winger Samuel Kalu missed Watford’s draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday due to a hamstring injury, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The 24-year-old joined the Hornets from Ligue 1 outfit, FC Girondins de Bordeaux, last month in a deal until June 2025 following three-and-a-half successful years in France’s top tier, where he scored nine goals. The Nigeria international is yet to make his debut for Watford since his arrival though he has been in the club’s matchday squad by Roy Hodgson twice. “In terms of injuries, (Samuel) Kalu, is suffering from a slight ankle injury,” Hodgson said. The Nigerian could however have to wait for another week before making his first appearance for the London club. Kalu who made his debut for the Eagles in September 2018 has been capped 17 times by Nigeria. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
