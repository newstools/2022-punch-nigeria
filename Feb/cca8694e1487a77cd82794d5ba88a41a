Terrorists were said to have killed and kidnapped scores in Shiroro and Munya Local Government Areas of Niger State. The attacks were said to have been carried out by the terrorists in Galadinma Kolgo, Erena, Chukuba, Allawa, Guni, Zagzaga and Dazza communities in the early hours of Saturday. The President, Lakpma Youth Association, Jibril Allawa, told our correspondent on Monday in Minna that the terrorists are demanding a ransom N60 million for the release of the abducted persons. He said the villages have been deserted, adding that the villagers have taken refuge in an Internally Displaced Persons camp. “Almost all the affected communities in the two local government areas are now ghost towns as the villagers have taken refuge at the IDP camp in Central Primary School, Gwada,” he said. A youth from the area, Abubakar Kokki, said, the gunmen stormed the communities and held residents captive for hours while they wrecked havoc. He said, “These villagers can no longer harvest their farm produces because the gunmen have warned them to stay away from their farms. “Yet the government has failed in its responsibility of protecting lives and property of the citizens. We are calling on the relevant security agencies to live up to their duty by protecting the people from the attacks on them by the armed bandits.” The Police Public Relations Officer, Wasiu Abiodun, did not take his calls as of the time of filing this report.
