German President, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, will begin a three-day visit to Senegal on Monday, with Senegalese President, Macky Sall, due to welcome him with military honours in Dakar on Monday morning. The two presidents are then scheduled to hold talks before participating in an economic conference. Steinmeier is accompanied on his visit by a delegation of German business representatives. The focus of Steinmeier’s visit, which will last until Wednesday, will be the establishment of facilities to produce COVID-19 vaccines in Africa, according to the president’s office in Berlin. Just a few days ago, German pharmaceutical giant BioNTech unveiled plans to build vaccine plants in Senegal, Rwanda and South Africa. Meanwhile, a further important topic will be the security situation in the Sahel region, where multiple European military missions to combat Islamist terrorism is ongoing. Senegal borders Mali, where the continued presence of European troops, including those deployed by the German Bundeswehr, is under scrutiny following a military coup. France, among others, has already announced an end to its military mission in the country. (dpa/NAN)
