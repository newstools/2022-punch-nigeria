A fire from a petrol tanker has razed a part of a filling station in Ogidi town, near Onitsha, Anambra State. It was gathered that the fire started  at about 11am on Friday while the  tanker was discharging its content at the filling station . The incident caused pandemonium around the area as residents and passers-by scampered for safety. It took the intervention of men of the Anambra Fire Service some hours to put off the fire and prevented it from escalating. However, no life was lost but the cause of the fire could not be immediately ascertained as of the time of filing this report. An eyewitness, who did not give his name said, “There was pandemonium in the entire area in Ogidi. The petrol tanker was discharging fuel at the filling station, when a small spark of fire was noticed, and before it could be extinguished, the tanker was already in flames, burning down the filling station.” The Anambra State Fire Service chief, Mr Martin Agbili, who confirmed the incident, said that his men had successfully put out the fire. He said, “At about 9:53am of today (Friday), we received a distress call of a fire outbreak at a petrol filling station at 7th Mile, Ogidi. “Our fire trucks and firefighters were deployed in the scene, both state and federal fire service, were there to fight the fire. The fire had been completely controlled and extinguished now. “There was no loss of life while the filling station was saved. The fire affected the tanker. The cause of the fire outbreak was as a result of a spark from the pumping ground during their trans-loading process.’’ Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
