The Anambra State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has promised to purchase the nomination form of the party for a former governor of the state, Dr Peter Obi. The party in a statement on their resolutions at the expanded State Executive Committee meeting released on Friday urged the former governor to “take a shot at the presidential race” in the 2023 general elections, adding that members would purchase the nomination form for him. The statement by the state chapter of the PDP read in part, “This decision of the party became expedient following a motion moved by Chief Ken Emeakayi and supported by Chief Okey Muo Aroh. “The decision to go ahead with the congresses as scheduled was occasioned by a rare show of leadership ability displayed by the former governor of Anambra State and leader of the party in the state, Mr Peter Obi, who created room for members to vote for or against the scheduled date.”  Copyright PUNCH.
