The Catholic Bishops of the Lagos Ecclesiastical Province have urged the Muhammadu Buhari-led regime to use all the resources at their disposal to put an end to the killings and violence across the country before they Nigerians. The Province made up of the Archbishop of Lagos, the Diocese of Ijebu-Ode and the Diocese of Abeokuta made this call at their first meeting for the year held in Lagos. In a communiqué jointly signed by the Chairman of the board, Revd Alfred Martins and Secretary, Rev Francis Adesina, they (bishops) wondered why despite the outcry and condemnation over the “continuous senseless killings of innocent people and violence across the country”, it was far from being abated. Sighting the many killings that dotted various aspects of Nigeria’s recent history, they said, “In the wake of the 2022 New Year, a priest of the Diocese of Abeokuta, Rev. Fr. Luke Adeleke, was killed by gunmen while carrying out his priestly activities. “Very recently, it was reported that in Taraba State, a Catholic Church was razed to the ground for no reason. These and numerous other cases of violence have been the hallmark of our nation. How long would these be allowed to continue?” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
