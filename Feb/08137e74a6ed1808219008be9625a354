The Nigerian Military School Ex-Boys Association on Saturday said its members would join the ongoing war and advocacy campaigns against illicit drug trafficking and abuse among Nigerian youths. The association made this known during a courtesy visit to the Chairman/CEO of the Agency, Brig. Gen. Mohammed Buba Marwa (retd.) on Saturday. The President of the group, Femi Ikuponiyi said they were on the visit to identify with Marwa’s accomplishment and vision for the NDLEA as an ex-boy and pride of the ex-boys family. Ikuponiyi said the association would support the advocacy campaigns of the agency in areas of intelligence gathering and reportage to eradicate the menace among the citizens. In his response, Marwa thanked the NMS ex-boys for the visit and their offer to support the drug war, as an indication that the key message of the War Against Drug Abuse, launched by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), last June was fast achieving its target of mobilising every citizen to take ownership of the battle against the drug scourge.
