A father, Mr Udo Ayanime, has been sentenced to death by a High Court sitting in Akamkpa, Cross River State, for killing his twin daughters, Mfoniso and Emediong. The convict was said to have accused the 11-year-old victims of witchcraft. Justice Agnes Onyebueke, who delivered judgement in the matter with suit number HK/6C/2018, said, “Udo’s action is satanic, demonic and beyond human comprehension.” The judge ruled that the convict “wilfully and gruesomely” murdered his daughters in 2017 after calling them witches. When cross-examined, the middle-aged man could not defend his action. He was said to have given the girls a malt drink mixed with acid. PUNCH Metro gathered that one of the twins died on the spot on January 10, 2017, while the second crawled to the road where a kind-hearted resident picked and took her to a hospital, where she died the following day. A child rights activist, Mr James Ibor, whose organisation, Basic Rights Counsel Initiative, started the case, said the incident was first reported in February 2017. Ibor said Udo was arrested by the police after investigation. “The police ensured that necessary medical examinations and autopsies were done on the deceased children, which aided the judgement. “This judgement is justice for the victims and the government of Cross River State,” he added.
