A former Senate Deputy Majority Leader, Silas Zwingina, has said political meanings should not be read into the decision to turban the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, as the Dan Amanar Daura or ‘Trusted Son of Daura’. According to him, it could have been political if there was no cogent reason for it, adding that the minister merited the honour. He said this in an interview with journalists in Abuja on Monday. Zwingina stated, “There’s nothing wrong about the timing. Nobody should read anything unusual meaning into the decision to turban him. At the time Orji Kalu and Rochas Okorocha were turbaned, politics was in the air as well. I think this is a community that has learnt to show appreciation. “It could have been political if there was no cogent reason for it, but in his own (Amaechi’s) case, there is, which is the existence of projects. Let us assume that they are doing it in order to help boost his image, what is wrong with that? People do good things and are honoured. “If the President is interested in making him the President, he does not have to go through the back door to go and meet Daura people; our President is not the type, who will go and ask his emir to do that for him. “Nobody can read the mind of the President but I think if he has that in mind, he would not go that cheap; the project being executed by Amaechi deserves that he should be turbaned.” Copyright PUNCH.
