Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency have intercepted 40,250 kilogrammes of codeine worth over N2bn imported in two 40-foot containers from India. The drug bust comes on the heels of a similar seizure of 14,080kg codeine syrup and 4,352.43kg cold caps used to conceal the former in a 40-foot container imported from India, on February 2, 2022, at the Apapa Seaport. The spokesperson for the NDLEA, Femi Babafemi, confirmed the development in a statement on Thursday. He said both seizures followed intelligence reports from foreign partners and cooperation of other port stakeholders such as the Nigeria Customs Service, Department of State Services, Nigerian Navy, among others. Babafemi explained that the latest consignments, intercepted on February 8, were brought into the country in two containers marked HLBU 2239792, with 1,125 cartons of the drug, and HLBU 1067338, with 1,751 cartons, with a market value of N2,012,500,000. He said, “The consignments were seized at the Port Express Bonded Terminal, Berger-Apapa, after they were discovered concealed behind cartons of hypergra 200mg and deluxe chilly cutters, after which the agency’s sniffer dogs were brought in to identify the illegal substance.” Copyright PUNCH.
