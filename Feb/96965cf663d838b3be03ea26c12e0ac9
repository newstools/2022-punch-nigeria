Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, on Sunday admitted that he and his predecessor, Senator Rabi’u Kwankwaso, are responsible for the face-lifting being witnessed in the state. Ganduje spoke at a stakeholder meeting he had at the Coronation Hall, Government House, Kano, with leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress in the state and from all the 44 local governments. The meeting afforded the governor the opportunity to brief the stakeholders about the recent judgment of the Court of Appeal on the leadership of the party at wards and local governments. Describing how people were amazed at the level of development in the state, particularly those who were not in the state for a long time, the governor said, “Those responsible for the new face of the state are Kwankwaso and Ganduje.” He assured them that his administration will continue to sustain developmental projects and policies for the development of the state at all levels of government. “The two governors (Kwankwaso and Ganduje) did their best in face-lifting the state. I will continue to maintain this as a governor of Kano state,” he said. After thanking the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and the chairman of the party’s Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Mai Mala Buni, and members of his team, for their concern over resolving the internal dispute of the party in the state, Ganduje invited those who lost in the Court of Appeal to come back and join hands with his faction to make the party stronger.
