The Enugu State Government on Friday banned the operations of tricycles, motorcycles and trucks in all the communities in Nkanu East and Nkanu West local government areas of the state. The ban also extended to the neighbouring communities of Amechi Uno, Amechi Awkunanaw, Amechi Uwani, Obeagu Main, Obeagu Uno, Centenary City/Obunagu, Obeagu,  One Day, Garki, Akwuke, Ugwuaji, Ndiagu Onunyo, Maryland and Ikiriki, all in Enugu South Local Government Area. Saturday PUNCH gathered that the ban was sequel to the emergency security meeting with chairmen and major stakeholders, including traditional rulers and presidents-general of the communities in five local government areas of Enugu South, Enugu East, Enugu North, Nkanu East and Nkanu West LGAs. A statement by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Simon Ortuanya, titled ‘Public service announcement’, indicated that the ban was the outcome of an emergency Security Council meeting held at the Government House on Thursday, February 24, 2022 following the upsurge of insecurity in the state capital and its environs since this year. The statement partly read, “Following an emergency Security Council meeting held in Enugu State Government House today, Thursday, 24th February 2022 on the heels of the recent spike in insecurity in parts of the State and Executive Order No.1: 2022 dated 24th February 2022, the operation of tricycle popularly called Keke, motorcycles otherwise known as okada, and tipper truck have been banned forthwith.”  Copyright PUNCH.
