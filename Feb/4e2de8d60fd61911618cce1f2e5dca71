ESPERANCE Tunis winger Anayo Iwuala is disappointed being left out of the Super Eagles squad to the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The former Enyimba man has five caps and made his debut in the AFCON qualifier against Benin in March 2021 under former Eagles gaffer Gernot Rohr. Speaking with PUNCH Sports Extra, Iwuala said he was pained not to be part of the team that went to Cameroon, but added he was hopeful of getting a call up for the World Cup playoffs. “It was so painful I couldn’t help my teammates at the AFCON because I really would have loved to be there,” the player said. “Every player wants to play competitive games for their national team and not being invited was a bit disappointing, but I have to move on and work harder and be prepared to take my chances when they come. “I’m hopeful of making a return to the Eagles and playing at the World Cup because that’s the dream of every footballer to play for the national team at the highest level. It will be a great honour for me to represent my country at the World Cup.” The 22-year-old added, “We have a lot of talents and that’s a clear indication that every invited player has what it takes to play for the country.” Copyright PUNCH.
