The Chairman of the Cross River State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, Venatius Ikem, has decried the alleged deployment of the military for election duties. Ikem spoke in Calabar on Thursday, ahead of the Ogoja/Yala Federal Constituency and the Akpabuyo State Constituency bye-election scheduled for Saturday. He described the action as illegal, stating that only the Army High Command had the powers for such deployment, alleging that the governor requested the deployment even when there was no imminent threat to peace. “They are trying to use underhand tactics. We will not allow any underhand tactics to hijack an election that we know we are poised to win. While we advise our members to remain vigilant, we will resist every attempt to hijack the election. We will use all legitimate means to insist on our rights and to ensure the right things are done,” he said. Ikem continued, “Specialised security units in the governor’s office are not supposed to be deployed for the election. “They know we will win overwhelmingly. That is why we are working hard to ensure nobody defeats us using the back door.” The chieftain further said the party had alerted the Inspector-General of Police and heads of other security agencies about the development. In his reaction, the state Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, Erasmus Ekpang, denied the allegation that the APC was deploying the military for the poll, describing it as just a rumour. According to him, “From February 15 to date, we have been in Ogoja/Yala and Akpabuyo, we have not sat anywhere to think of the deployment of the military or any force but have been doing the work for the people to vote who they really want.”
