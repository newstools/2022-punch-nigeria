The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has signed into law three bills which were earlier passed by the state House of Assembly. Sanwo-Olu disclosed this on Monday while also swearing-in two advisers during the weekly State Executive Council meeting at the Lagos House, Ikeja. The governor signed the law to regulate real estate transactions in Lagos State; the law to provide for the registration of cooperative societies in the state as well as the law to regulate ownership, licensing and sales of pets and to prohibit and restrict people from having in custody dangerous animals in public places. He said, “The law to regulate the real estate transactions in Lagos State will help to protect the citizens who fall prey to many real estate professionals and it will also help players in the real estate sector to know what is expected of them and for the government to be able to track who is doing what in the sector. “The law to provide for the registration of cooperative societies in Lagos State will make it easy to regulate the operations of thousands of cooperative societies in the state for harmonious cooperation. “The law regulating the ownership, licensing and sales of pets, prohibiting and restricting people from having in custody dangerous animals in public places, will further strengthen all the deliverables in the Ministry of Agriculture, especially issues that have to do with pets and animals.” Sanwo-Olu also inaugurated the Special Adviser on Public-Private Partnerships, Mr Ope George, and Special Adviser on Agriculture (Rice Mill Initiative), Dr Oluwarotimi Fashola.
