There was heavy security presence on the premises of an Osogbo Federal High Court as Justice Nathaniel Ayo-Emmanuel rules on jurisdiction and other objections to the case filed by aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress against the last ward congress of the party in Osun state. Four Hilux vans filled with armed and unarmed policemen were stationed in front of the court premises. Apart from the large presence of police operatives, members of ex-governor Rauf Aregbesola’s faction and those of the incumbent governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, who spoke to our correspondent on the premises of the court, expressed hope of getting favourable judgment. As of the time of filing this report, the court is in session. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
