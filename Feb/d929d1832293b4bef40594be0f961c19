The National Consultative Front has said the political movement will go into the 2023 elections with everything to sweep the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party out from power. One of the leaders of the NCFront, Wale Okunniyi, said this
called on members of the group to begin to sensitise Nigerians on the need to come together and form a strong force to dislodge the two leading political parties from power during the elections. He said this on Thursday in Ibadan while addressing leaders of NCFront at the South-West Zonal General Assembly of NCFront. According to him, NCFront is an amalgam of leaders of conscience who are desirous of credible change in the country. Okunniyi said, “We are yet to adopt any political party but we are looking at some political parties such as People’s Redemption Party; National Rescue Movent, African Democratic Congress, and Zenith Labour Party. “Our alliance will lead to the formation of a mega party. Our mission is to rescue Nigeria from the misrule of the APC and PDP “What we are doing today is history and we must count ourselves lucky to be part of this history. We have to move from door to door to get people registered. “We have come from the National Secretariat and by March 8 or thereabouts there will be the launch of the mega party for the coalescing forces “We will go to the ballots with all our strength and sweep away the broom. And the umbrella with all their forces.” The NCFront leader from Osun State, Lanre Fadahunsi, also urged members to begin an aggriesive membership drive to make the masses know that the group was ready to wipe away their years of many years.
