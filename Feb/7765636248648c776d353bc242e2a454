Nollywood actor, Samuel Ajibola, on Wednesday admitted that being a father has changed his life completely. The actor, who was popular for his role as Spiff in family drama The Johnsons, used the opportunity to also appreciate parents. Ajibola, who welcomed his first child two months ago, shared a video of himself and his child on his Instagram page. In the caption, the new dad revealed how he changed his daily schedule since the coming of his son. He wrote, “My Life has completely changed since I had my first kid. I mean, is this what parents go through? I now partake in daily night vigils and sleep with him during the day so I can run my shift with him at night. “Before you get him to sleep, you’ll carry him till your arms are weak. You’ll sing, stand, dance and even pray for his eyes to close but the moment you are convinced that he has started sleeping and you try to lay him down so you can rest, boom! his eyes are wide open and he is crying all over again!! “I have now come to appreciate all parents more and give special kudos to those who have twins. #diaryofanewdad.” Corroborating his claims, the actor’s wife, Sandra, also shared her own experience with her two-month old son. Sharing a video of herself and her child on her Instagram page, she wrote, “You give me joy, you give me happiness, and you give me peace of mind; joy of motherhood which includes sleepless nights.” Copyright PUNCH.
