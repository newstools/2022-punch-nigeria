Robert Whittaker has regretted his defeat to Israel Adesanya in their UFC 271 encounter. Whittaker came into the challenge to regain the middleweight championship he lost to Adesanya in 2019. But he came up short as Adesanya retained the title via unanimous decision in the highly competitive fight. Adesanya’s jabs and heavy leg kicks piled up points as he took the decision by scores of 48-47, 48-47, and 49-46. The win over Whittaker was Adesanya’s fourth defense of the middleweight championship since winning the belt in the first meeting with Whittaker. For Whittaker, who had a three-fight winning streak snapped, the loss was a tough pill to swallow. “Yeah, I did [think I won the fight],” Whittaker said. “I know I started off rocky in the first round but I felt like I took everyone after that. It is what it is. As they say, don’t leave it in the hands of the judges. I’m gutted. I’m gutted. I thought I did enough.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
