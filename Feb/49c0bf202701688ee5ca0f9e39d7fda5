D’Tigress will know their 2022 FIBA Women’s World Cup group opponents on March 3, in a ceremony billed to take place in Sydney, Australia. Nigeria booked a place at the World Cup, thanks to wins over France and Mali at the recent qualifying tournament in Serbia, despite losing their first game to China. They join hosts Australia, defending champions the United States as well as Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, China, France, Japan, Korea, Russia and Serbia to slug it out for the best women’s basketball team in the world. The FIBA Women’s Basketball World Cup 2022 will feature the world’s top 12 women’s national teams, with 38 games to be played across 10 days from September 22 to October 1, in Sydney. This will be Australia’s second time hosting the event, with the last time being in 1994. D’Tigress will be hoping to surpass their 2018 output in Spain, where they became the first African country to reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup. In 2018, despite losing their opening game to Australia, they bounced back with wins over Turkey and Argentina, before beating Greece in the quarter-final qualifying round. They lost 71-40 to the United States in the quarter-finals. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
