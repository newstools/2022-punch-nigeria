Sale Ahmadu, a Special Adviser to Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba State, on Thursday, resigned his appointment, saying the government has lost focus. Ahmadu’s resignation comes less than a month after the resignation of another Special Assistant, Usman Sa’adu, and two others who resigned their appointments citing personal reasons. The resignation letter addressed to the Governor through the Office of the Secretary to the State Government, Anthony Jellason, read, “The past two years or so have been most challenging in my life and faith. “I was paid salaries without any responsibility which is against my faith particularly in a government and party that has lost focus. “Like the children of Israel in the wilderness, the present administration under Governor Ishaku is moving in a circle without any progress. “I, therefore, want to be counted among those that have heard the voice of God to move forward.” Reacting to the resignation, State Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Hon. Andeta’rang Irammae, debunked the claim that the government of Ishaku under PDP has lost focus. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
