Two persons, an adult, and a little child lost their lives when an unidentified driver of an orange Mercedes 911 truck rammed into a filling station in Anambra State. As gathered, the truck with number plate UWZ556XA, rammed into six other vehicles at Ken Maduako’s oil and gas filling station along the Ihialla-Onitsha road area of the state. The accident which occurred on Friday, also had nine persons sustaining varying degrees of injuries while 52 people were rescued unhurt. According to an eyewitness, about 63 people were involved in the crash. The eyewitness said the truck driver, who was on a top speed, while approaching a police checkpoint, lost control and rammed into the vehicles on the queue at the police checkpoint and crashed. The Federal Road Safety Corps rescue team from Ihiallia Unit Command rushed the victims to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Ihiallia, where a male adult and a male child were confirmed dead. The dead victims were deposited at the hospital morgue while the FRSC rescue team on the ground, managed the traffic and ensured obstruction caused by the crash was removed. The Sector Commander, Anambra State, Corps Commander Adeoye Irelewuyi, while commiserating with families of the deceased, warned motorists in the state to avoid overspeeding and ensure they keep to the recommended speed limit. “Speed drills, but kills, check your speed and not your watch. Let us keep our roads safe from crash,” he warned. Our correspondent, who went round the Onitsha-Owerri Road, notorious for police checkpoints and extortions, observed that police had deserted their usual checkpoints at Idemili, Obosi, Oba, for possible fear of being attacked.
