London-based Nigerian Disk Jockey, Florence Otedola, popularly known as DJ Cuppy, has stated that she hated to glamorise her life. The Oxford University student made this known on her Instagram story on Sunday, as she noted that schooling and being a presenter wasn’t an easy task for her. Cuppy had last month revealed that she had started to host a show at BBC1Xtra radio. Sharing some pictures of the moments at the studio where she recorded her show, the singer noted that being a full-time student and part-time presenter wasn’t easy for her. According to her, she really worked hard and hated to glamorise her life. She wrote, “Being a full time student at Oxford University and part time radio presenter at the BBC is not easy. I hate to glamorise my life. I really work hard. There’s no other way to put it.” In a post last week, DJ Cuppy had revealed that she’d be graduating from Oxford University by June. Copyright PUNCH.
