skit maker and actress, Kemi Ikuseedun, popularly known as Mummy wa, the fictional wife of Mr Macaroni, has said she doesn’t pay attention to negative comments. Speaking in an interview with Sunday Scoop, she said, “I don’t pay attention to negative comments. People send me messages on social media. I don’t even read them. I cannot say I am being bullied. As far as I’m concerned, they are only wasting their data.” On the role she won’t play even if offered a huge amount of money, she said, “I won’t play a role that will require me to show myself in a way that I don’t like or portray me in a bad light. No matter the amount (of money), I won’t take such a role.” Speaking on the Valentine’s Day skit she recently shot with Mr Macaroni in which she wore a sexy outfit, she said, “It was nice, I enjoyed myself.” The actress also stated that she gets a lot of funny requests from men, which would have still being the case even if she was not in the public eye. Ikuseedun went on to admit that irrespective of what one does, one could feel frustrated. She said, “No matter what one does, there are times that frustration would come into play. One could get frustrated if one has not got to a certain level or stage one wants to get to.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
