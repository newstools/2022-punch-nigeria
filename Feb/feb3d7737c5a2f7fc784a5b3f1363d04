The Lagos State Government has called on residents of the state to embrace waste policing as a means of creating jobs for youths in communities. The Managing Director of the Lagos Waste Management Authority, Mr Ibrahim Odumboni, made this call while addressing market officials representing community development committees, held in Ikorodu West Local Council Development Area, Owutu. He said, “You need to empower the youths in Ikorodu West LCDA and create jobs for them through waste policing. You have the constitutional backing; use your bylaws to establish what will be beneficial to your community. “LAWMA is ready to train these youths so that they will go into the communities in uniforms to apprehend violators and this would serve as a deterrent to others. These youths can work together with the council’s health officers to enforce the environmental laws of the state. Epe Local Government Area and Ibeju-Lekki LCDA have employed over 70 youths to achieve a healthier environment and it has worked for them, so you can also emulate such an effective strategy.” The Majority Leader, Lagos State House of Assembly, Sanai Agunbiade, who was represented by Temitope Ogunde, said the necessary laws would be instituted to aid waste management in the area. “The necessary legislative requirements would be put in place to reposition waste management in the area and I want to urge residents to cooperate with environmental health officers in their domains to ensure hygienic surroundings,” he said.
