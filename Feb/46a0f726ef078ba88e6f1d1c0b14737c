Justice Binta Nyako of a Federal High Court Abuja, has fixed April 8 for ruling on a preliminary objection filed by the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, challenging the validity of the 15 amended charges filed against him by the Federal Government. Justice Nyako fixed the date after counsel for Kanu, Mike Ozekhome (SAN) as well as prosecution counsel, Shuaibu Labaran, had adopted arguments for and against the defendant’s preliminary objection. In a short adumbration, Ozekhome pleaded with the court to acquit and dismiss all the charges filed against Kanu by the Federal Government. At a resumed trial on Wednesday, Ozekhome argued that the 15-count amended charge was “defective and baseless”. Specifically, he informed the court that his application seeks the “quashing, striking out and dismissing of the 15-count amended charge” against Kanu for being “incompetent and denying the court of jurisdiction” to entertain charge. The application, with 34 grounds, and supported by 36-paragraph affidavit, Ozekhome said, also seeks for an order acquitting and discharging Kanu for want of jurisdiction and defective, baseless and incompetent charges. Ozekhome adopted his application and asked court to quash, strike out and dismiss the entire charges. He asked the court to look at the entire grounds and affidavit, from paragraph 5 to 36, of notice of preliminary objection, etc. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
