Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has said he will announce the new Olubadan of Ibadanland on Monday. Makinde made this known on Saturday at the grand finale of the burial of the late Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji, at the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium, Ibadan. He said all issues hindering the announcement and installation of the new Olubadan had been resolved. “This is another victory for the Ibadan traditional institution; the process and the system were never broken, so we have reverted to the age long system,” Makinde stated. The governor said he had received a letter from the Olubadan-in-Council in respect of the announcement of the new monarch. According to him, Ibadanland has a unique procedural step as regards the enthronement of a new Oba and this has been in existence for ages. Makinde thanked all Ibadan indigenes and well-wishers that came to witness the final burial ceremony. He prayed that Ibadanland would continue to witness more development. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the late Oba Adetunji, who was the 41st Olubadan of Ibadanland, died on January 2, 2022 at the age of 93. In a tribute to the late monarch, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), described Oba Adetunji as a visionary and compassionate leader, who used the spheres of his influence to advance the progress of his people. “We trust that the process of selecting his successor will be guided by wisdom, understanding and good judgment that exemplified the life he lived,” the President said.
