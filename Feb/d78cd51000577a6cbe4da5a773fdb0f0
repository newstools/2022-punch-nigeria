A Coalition of Civil Society Organisations says a new legal framework is required to safeguard the integrity of elections in the country. The Convener of the Coalition, Mrs Ene Obi, said this at a news conference on Friday in Abuja. The News Agency of Nigeria quoted Obi to have said such law was required as the country prepares for off-cycle governorship election in Ekiti and Osun states, and the 2023 general elections. According to her, the Electoral Amendment Act Bill 2022 contains provisions that can address electoral manipulation and poor election logistics. “Furthermore, the bill strengthens INEC’s financial independence, and the commission is empowered to reject falsified election results. “The newly introduced timelines for key electoral activities such as early primaries and submission of list of candidates will facilitate early electoral preparations and promote issue based political engagement,’’ she said. The CSOs were Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room, Yiaga Africa, Partners for Electoral Reform The Albino Foundation, International Press Centre, Institute for Media Society and Centre for Citizens with Disability. Others included Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism, Transition Monitoring Group, CLEEN Foundation, Labour Civil Society Coalition, Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre, Inclusive Friends Association, Enough is Enough and The Electoral Hub.
