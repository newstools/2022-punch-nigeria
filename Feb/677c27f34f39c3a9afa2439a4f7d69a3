The Gombe State Governor, Muhammadu Yahaya, says it is the prayers of clerics such as the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God,  Pastor Enoch Adeboye, and others that have been sustaining Nigeria. The governor said this on Friday during Adeboye’s courtesy visit to him in Gombe. He thanked the pastor for choosing Gombe as one of the states to visit for his reach-out campaign tagged: “Light up eight city crusade,” which was organised as part of activities to mark the cleric’s 80th birthday. Yahaya, who was represented by the Deputy Governor, Dr Manassah Jatau, said,  “With the rate at which Nigeria is filled with misfortunes of insecurity, economic hardships, one can only believe that it is the prayers of the people like Pastor Adeboye that is sustaining the nation. “Prayers can never be enough; we solicit more prayers towards sustainable peace, unity and progress.” Speaking earlier, Adeboye informed his host that he was in Gombe State to honour his spiritual children who organised “Light up Nigeria” to mark his 80th birthday. He added, “I rejoice with you people of Gombe that God is visiting Gombe today. His coming is a sign that all forces of darkness shall vanish in the state and entire Africa.”  Copyright PUNCH.
