Wilfred Ndidi has said the relationship between him and his compatriot, fellow Leicester City player, Kelechi Iheanacho, is very great. This is as he revealed that he had known Iheanacho right from their academy days, adding that it has been amazing having him around. “The relationship between me and [Iheanacho] is very great. It’s amazing because people thought we were just teammates, playing for Leicester and playing for the national team,” Ndidi was quoted by Leicester City website. “But I have known Kelechi since we were in the academy, very young, so it’s not just new. We’ve been very close since we were in [Nigeria] Under-17s together. It’s been amazing having him around. I’m enjoying every moment.” Both players are expected to feature for Leicester City in their clash with Randers in the Europa Conference League at the King Power Stadium on Thursday night. “When the game starts, it doesn’t matter how long you have played,” Iheanacho said ahead of the game. “In football, it’s just about their ability and their love for the game to go for it. It’s not how far you’ve actually trained. People are just physically and mentally ready. “It might be a great opportunity for us as a team and we look forward to these games and just look to take it as it comes. I expect it to be a really tough game because every team playing is worthy of winning the competition. “Seeing videos about the team, they are a really good side and I think we are ready for it. They are very compact, they work together as a team. For us, we have ways to see how we can approach the game.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
