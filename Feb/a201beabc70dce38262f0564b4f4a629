The Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, has revealed that All Progressives Congress governors were initially divided over the convention date of the party. The division, he said, was between some governors who wanted to hold the convention only after resolving the disagreements at the state levels and those who wanted to hold it and resolve the state crises later. El-Rufai said this on Tuesday while briefing State House Correspondents shortly after a meeting with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at Aso Rock Villa, Abuja. The governor, who spoke shortly after the address of the PGF Chairman, Governor Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi State, however, said it was a mere disagreement typical of any group and does not constitute a major “division” in the forum. He revealed that the governors have agreed on March 26 as the convention date and have secured the approval of the President. On zoning, El-Rufai said Northern zones will take the positions Southern zones have occupied in the last eight years. Meanwhile, the PGF chairman said that the party’s next chairman would emerge from consensus. According to Bagudu, the APC has chosen past chairmen such as Bisi Akande, John Oyegun and Adams Oshiomhole based on consensus and it would not be strange to do so this time around. He also said that Buhari has okayed the March 26 National Convention date and agreed to the current timetable as released by the Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee on Monday. Bagudu maintained that the governors are united over these matters and will forge ahead with preparations for the March 26 National Convention. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
