A Kano State High Court presided over by Justice Maryam Sabo on Thursday sentenced a 27-year-old woman, Sadiya Ahmadu, to nine years imprisonment with hard labour, for kidnapping a three-year-old girl. According to the Charge Sheet by the Prosecution Counsel from the Ministry for Justice, Kano State, Ahmadu was arraigned on one count charge of kidnapping. “Sadiya Adamu of Titin Badaru, Gayawa, Qtrs, Kano, on or about 22nd March 2018, at about 1100hrs at Gayawa Qtrs kidnapped one Khadija Nura, a 3-year-old girl from the lawful guardianship of her parents.” The Prosecution informed the court that the defendant requested N1 million ransom from Khadija’s father. To prove his case, the Prosecution Counsel called the parents of the victim who testified how the defendant kidnapped their daughter. Earlier during the trial, the prosecution witnesses stated how Sadiya kidnapped Khadija while she was praying at Gayawa Qtrs in Ungogo LGA, Kano and took her to Karaduwa Village in Matazu LGA of Katsina State. The Defense counsel, Barr. Y. S. Gama, presented Sadiya Ahmadu who defended herself. In her judgement, Justice Maryam Sabo upheld that the Prosecution Counsel, Barrister M. M. Faroukh, proved his case of kidnapping against Sadiya Ahmadu beyond reasonable doubt. She was convicted and accordingly sentenced to 9 years imprisonment with hard labour. Justice Sabo also ordered the convict to pay an additional fine of N200,000 or serve one year in a Correctional Centre in default. She also ordered that the sentence starts from the date of first arrest and detention in the Correctional Center. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
