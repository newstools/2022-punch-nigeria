Nigerian singer, Seyi Shay, has congratulated her Barbadian counterpart, Rihanna Fenty, who set the internet agog on Monday when photos of her baby bump emerged, as she posed with her lover and rapper, A$AP Rocky. Seyi Shay, while congratulating Rihanna on Tuesday, stated that the latter’s pregnancy was the best news she has heard this year. In a tweet, the Nigerian singer also noted that she knew about the pregnancy since last year. The PemPe singer wrote, “Big Congratulations to @rihanna.This is the best news I’ve heard this year (but knew since last year).” This comes days after Seyi Shay, born Oluwaseyi Joshua, opened up on her engagement but declined to comment on her rumoured pregnancy. Asides from Seyi Shay, Rihanna’s father, Ronald Fenty, has also expressed excitement over his daughter’s pregnancy, as he revealed that he only knew about it on Sunday night. The grandfather-to-be had said on Monday, “I just got the news from her last night, and she sent me some photos. I’m just over the moon. She’s beautiful inside and out.” Copyright PUNCH.
