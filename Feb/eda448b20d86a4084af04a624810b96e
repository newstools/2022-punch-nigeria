Globally renowned Barbadian singer, Rihanna, set the internet agog on Monday when photos of her baby bump emerged, as she posed with her lover and rapper, A$AP Rocky. In a statement to Page Six on Monday, Rihanna’s father, Ronald Fenty, expressed his excitement over the news, adding that his daughter informed him about the pregnancy on Sunday night. “I just got the news from her last night, and she sent me some photos. I’m just over the moon. She’s beautiful inside and out,” Ronald said. He added, “I’m ecstatic. I’m so happy that I jumped for joy. I’m still so excited. “Rihanna always said that she wanted children, she loves kids. She always takes care of her cousins’ kids…she’s going to be a good mom.” The singer’s father had met Rocky when Rihanna brought him to their Caribbean home in December and had described the rapper as a “cool guy”, adding, “I like him.” In an interview with GQ magazine in May 2020, the rapper when asked about his relationship with the Barbadian beauty, regarded her as “the love of my life,” and his lady.
