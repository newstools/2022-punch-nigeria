Barifodum, however, raised concerns over the circumstances surrounding the death, as he called on the police to carry out a thorough investigation into the case. “When there is suicide, there are things that are peculiar to such acts, so we are still requesting that the police do an investigation into what really happened,” Barifodum stated. The acting spokesperson for the state police command, Grace Iringe-Koko, also confirmed the incident. “We are aware of the incident and we have started investigation to ascertain what led to it.
