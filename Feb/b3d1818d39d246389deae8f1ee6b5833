The Founder and Chairman, Phillips Consulting, Mr Foluso Phillips, has suggested ways Nigerian government can embark on productive educational programme for the teeming population. Speaking via youtube channel, where he gave his opinion on how to make the education sector attractive to young Nigerians, he said, education could be used to drive the economy, saying, it should be used as anchor for everything. “If we decide that we will be spending the greatest amount of our budget on educating our people, then, that’s a step forward. Educating our people and doing it in a digital manner is the next step and if we are going to do it digitally means that we are going to be investing a massive amount of money in building digital infrastructures in such a way that everybody has a right to digital access. Now, once you do that, you are unleashing such a powerful mechanism for making the economy to grow and it means that everything we do must support education, so if education becomes the anchor, it means industrialisation. “A basic example of how you can use education to drive the whole economy and its a double win, you are educating the people at the same time you are providing a means of livelihood for them in the process of education, it sounds very basic my own position is that if we can go back and focus on education as the anchor for everything.” He added that while investing in education, attention should be paid on educating the youths who are over 50 per cent of the country’s populations.
