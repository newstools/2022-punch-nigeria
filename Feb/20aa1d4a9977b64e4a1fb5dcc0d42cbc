THE President of the Senate, Senator Ahmad Lawan, has said the National Assembly will make a case for official roles for the traditional rules in the ongoing constitutional reviews. He was quoted by his Special Adviser (Media), Ola Awoniyi, to have said this at the Palace of the Emir of Ilorin, Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari while on a courtesy visit. Lawan said, “We believe, in the ninth National Assembly, that our royal fathers must have a role and a better and clearly official role and function in our constitution so that we are able to have an all-inclusive governance structure that will ensure that our Royal Fathers do what they are doing today in a more official manner.” Responding, Sulu-Gambari said, “What we ask for is advisory participation. We are saying that there should be a council of traditional rulers who could be sought to give advice and to take part in bringing sanity to the governance of this country.” Copyright PUNCH.
