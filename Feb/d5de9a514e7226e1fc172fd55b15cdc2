The Chairman of the Transition Implementation Committee in Offa Local Government Area of Kwara State, Hon. Jare Olatundun, has been docked by a Magistrate Court. His appearance in court was in relation to his alleged failure to offset a debt of N5 million which he inherited from past administration in the Council to a contractor, Engr Agboworin Orimadegun. According to the charges before the court, Olatundun inherited the debt but allegedly disobeyed court judgement that ordered that the council tractor be seized over the issue. Counsel to Agboworin, Barr. Ibrahim Sharafadeen, approached the court with an application that Olatundun must be prosecuted for allegedly frustrating order of the court. Barr. B.L Ijaya, who represented the Council chairman, urged the court to dismiss the application. He argued that the council is a government parastatal and that Olatundun cannot be solely prosecuted. But Magistrate Abdullazeez Gamba, who presided over the matter, urged the two parties to adopt an amicable settlement and adjourned the suit to February 14th, 2022. Copyright PUNCH.
