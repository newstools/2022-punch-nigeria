The Italian media has taken a swipe at Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen in the wake of his performance in Napoli’s 1-1 draw at home to reigning Serie A champions Inter Milan on Saturday, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The media outfits: Corriere dello Sport, Corriere della Sera, La Gazzetta dello Sport and Tuttosport, all claimed the 23-year-old was not at his usual best at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. The Partenopei took an early lead in the match, following a Lorenzo Insigne penalty, after Osimhen was fouled in the area, before an Edin Dzeko strike restored parity for the visitors. The Super Eagles striker failed to take advantage of the plethora of chances presented to him on the counter. Despite his contribution in the game, Osimhen’s performance against Inter did not convince the Italian media, with Corriere dello Sport feeling that the Nigerian was ‘never decisive’ in the match, like he had been for the club. Corriere della Sera also echoed similar view, saying, “He (Osimhen) made the whole Nerazzurri defence dance but more cynicism is needed in front of goal.” Napoli had the chance to rise to the top of the league table with a win over Inter Saturday, but the draw left them trailing the Milan club by two points. The Nigerian has scored 10 goals in 18 games this season.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
