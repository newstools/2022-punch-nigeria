Two persons have been reportedly killed by suspected kidnappers in Molege community, Ose Local Government Area of Ondo State and in Ondo town. It was gathered that one of the deceased, a farmer, identified as Zacheus Olotu, was kidnapped and later found dead in the bush in Molege. The deceased hailed from Oka Akoko, Akoko South West Local Government Area of the state. The second victim, Sunday Okeke, was reportedly shot dead last Saturday in Ondo town while on his way to Anambra State. A source said Okeke was travelling alongside two of his friends when they were kidnapped. The deceased was reported to have attempted to flee into a nearby bush when he was shot dead while others were taken away by the kidnappers. The deceased’s widow, Chioma, said she was shocked about the news of her husband’s death, adding, “The police and other security agencies should fish out and prosecute the killers of my husband.” The monarch of Oka Akoko, Oba Yusuf Adeleye, urged the police to get to the root of the matter and arrest the culprits. The Police Public Relations Officer, Ondo State Command, Funmilayo Odunlami, however, denied knowledge of the killings. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
