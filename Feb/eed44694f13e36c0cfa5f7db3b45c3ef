The Akwa Ibom State Commissioner of Lands and Water Resources, Pst Umo Eno, has warned vehicles with number plates bearing the Insignia ” “Umo Eno” to remove them or risk being apprehended by the law enforcement agencies. Eno who was recently anointed by Governor Udom Emmanuel, as his preferred successor for the 2023 governorship race, said it is an offence in Nigeria not to properly display identification number warning that such vehicles would impound and the owners prosecuted in line with the extant laws. This was contained in a statement from the media unit of Umo Eno campaign organisation on Monday titled ” It is illegal to cover your vehicle number plate” made available to our correspondent in Uyo, the state capital. The statement reads in part “The Nigeria Police, Akwa Ibom State Command has drawn our attention to an evolving practice of motorists in Akwa Ibom State covering their number plates with materials bearing the insignia of “UMO ENO” in various forms. “While we deeply appreciate the overwhelming show of endorsement of the “UMO ENO” project, the general public is please enjoined to note that it is an offence not to properly display vehicle identification number on any vehicle plying Nigerian roads, and that such vehicle could be impounded while the drivers\owners will be arrested and prosecuted in line with the extant laws. “Ilegal covering of number plates has both safety and security implication and the act goes against Sections 10 (4) (h) and 10 (4) (s) of the FRSC (Establishment) Act, 2007 as well as sections 36 and 39 of the National Road Traffic Regulations (NRTR) 2012. “Members of the public are please advised to remove all forms of materials with “UMO ENO” insignia covering their vehicle number plates immediately to avoid being apprehended by law enforcement agencies” Copyright PUNCH.
