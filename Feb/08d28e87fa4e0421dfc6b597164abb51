The Coalition of Northern Groups on Thursday announced the suspension of all planned protests against the Federal Government over what it described as “an indiscriminate hike” in tuition fees of Universities in the region. The organisation, however, commended the Senate for swinging into action with a pledge to invite concerned authorities in order to mitigate the consequential effect of the hike in tuition costs. The CNG had two weeks ago condemned the sharp increase in the cost of varsity education across the Northern states, threatening to mobilise students in the region to resist it. But the National Coordinator of CNG (Student Wing), Jamilu Charanchi, while briefing journalists in Abuja, urged the Senate not to renege on its promise to enable students from poor and marginalised families to access tertiary education and break the chain of poverty. Consequently, he appealed “to the students and all other well meaning Nigerians to remain law abiding and not take the law into their hands, as the Senate promises that to address the issue in the most decent and polite way possible. “In line with the above, all zonal rallies and state press conferences should be on hold, pending the outcome from the Senate.” Copyright PUNCH.
