Switzerland’s Beat Feuz scorched to gold in the men’s Olympic downhill on Monday in a dramatic race that pitted skiers against an unforgiving course that was untested before the Games. The Swiss racer clocked 1min 42.69sec, finishing 0.10sec ahead of 41-year-old Frenchman Johan Clarey, while Austrian Matthias Mayer claimed a third Olympic medal in three Games with bronze. AFP
