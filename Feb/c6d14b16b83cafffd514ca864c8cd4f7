Some elders in Ekiti State, on Wednesday, lamented the spate of kidnapping and ritual killings in the state, describing the situation as deplorable and making lives unbearable for the people. The senior citizens, under the aegis of the Ekiti Council of Elders, called on the people to shun those flaunting sudden wealth from unknown sources so as to discourage ritual killers and Internet fraudsters. The council’s Chairman, Prof Joseph Oluwasanmi, and Secretary, Niyi Ajibulu, in a statement also advised religious centres preaching prosperity to deemphasise riches and make the ‘Omoluabi’ attributes their primary focus. The statement also called for communal cooperation and closer family relationships for support and monitoring of individual members. The council called for the deployment of additional security personnel and more effective patrol of the roads and advised on the setting up of closer security checkpoints at identified black spots where hoodlums had struck a number of times. Oluwasanmi and Ajibulu said the issues of concern were central in the agenda for the council’s meeting on Thursday. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
