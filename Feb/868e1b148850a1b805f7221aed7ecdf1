The people of Offa in the Offa Local Government Area of Kwara State on Friday stormed the Government House, Ilorin to protest the seeming delay in the trial of suspects arrested in connection with the April 5, 2018, bank robbery incident which claimed the lives of some residents and policemen in the town. Thirty-three persons including nine policemen were killed by the armed robbers who invaded some commercial banks in Offa four years ago. The suspected armed robbers also reportedly carted away about N10m during the bloody attack. The aggrieved people of Offa, who were at the Government House, Ilorin to urge the state governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, to expedite action on the trial of the suspects with a view to serve the victims and their relations with justice, carried placards with various inscriptions. Some of the messages on the placards include; “Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, don’t fold your hands. Expedite action on the trial of Offa robbery suspects”, “We need justice on Offa robbery incident”, “The blood of Offa 33 victims is crying”, among others. Addressing the protesters on behalf of the governor, the state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Salman Jawondo, said that the case is still pending before a court of competent jurisdiction. Jawondo said that no stone would be left unturned until justice is served on the matter. All the five suspects in the 2018 Offa bank robbery; Ayoade Akinnibosun, Ibikunle Ogunleye, Adeola Abraham, Azeez Salawu and Niyi Ogundiran are all standing trial before Justice Haleema Salman of the Kwara State High Court, Ilorin.
