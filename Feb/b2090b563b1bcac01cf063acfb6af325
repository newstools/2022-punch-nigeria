Rivers United gaffer, Stanley Eguma and Sunshine Stars goalkeeper, Mohammed Lawal, have claimed the first Nigeria Professional Football League Coach and Player of The Month awards for the year. The awards are organised by LBANigeria. Organised since 2009, the monthly award serves as an inspiration for coaches and players, the key performers in the domestic league. Eguma edged his Remo Stars counterpart, Gbenga Ogunbote, to claim the coaches’ award. Also nominated in this category were Plateau United’s Fidelis Ilechukwu and Sunshine Stars’ Deji Ayeni respectively. It was a close race, with all four coaches guiding their teams to pick 12 points respectively. However, Rivers scored thrice when they won at MFM and shared points at Remo Stars for Eguma to claim the gong. Lawal grabbed the Player of The Month award following his five-star outing in the month under review. It’s rare for goalkeepers to pick awards when nominated with other strikers, but five clean sheets against Lobi Stars, Kano Pillars and Gombe United at home, and two on the road at Akwa United and high-flying Rivers United earned the young keeper the award. Amazingly, Lawal, a fresher in the NPFL, edged Rivers United striker, Ishaq Rafiu, Nasarawa United’s Tochukwu Udeh and Plateau United’s Jesse Akila, to the award. Eguma and Lawal will receive their awards this week. All rights reserved.
