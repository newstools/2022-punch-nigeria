Dana Airlines Limited on Wednesday explained that its Lagos-bound flight from the Federal Capital Territory made an air return to Abuja due to bad weather. The airline’s spokesman, Kingsley Ezenwa, in a statement, said the passengers were later asked to disembark from the aircraft. The statement read, “Our flight 9J 336 from Abuja to Lagos on 23rd February 2022 had an air return due to bad weather at destination. “The passengers on the aircraft were advised to disembark and board another of our aircraft on ground, so the aircraft that had the air return could refuel for another flight. “At Dana Air, the safety of our crew and passengers will remain at the centre of everything we do and this commitment won’t change anytime soon.” The Nigerian civil airspace has maintained a relatively safe record in about a decade now which has increased passengers’ confidence in air travel. The last air crash in the country involving a commercial airplane was in June 2012 when a Dana Air MD-83 aircraft from Abuja crashed near the Lagos airport while attempting an emergency landing, killing all 153 souls on board and six on the ground.
