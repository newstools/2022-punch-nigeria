Speaking at the premiere, Akingbade, who plays the lead role in the movie, said, “The film is based on a true-life story mixed with fiction. It is the story of how a working-class lady, Omorewa, battled with life’s challenges and found it tough to find true love, until much later. It is full of intrigues, suspense and a beautiful twist. It is a must-watch for everyone” Popular actress, Ayo Adesanya, who also acted in the movie, described it as a ‘complete package’. She said, “This movie is a complete package. It is an interesting one that would keep viewers glued to their television screens.” From parts of the movie shown at the premiere, Merrymakers gleaned that the title character, Omorewa, was jilted by several men at different times, even as she desperately wanted to get married. Her suitors took advantage of her vulnerability and broke her heart on several occasions. Produced by Akingabade, the movie was written and directed by Babatunde Akorede. Other actors in the movie include Ronke Odusanya and Emmanuel Umoh. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
