The Arewa Consultative Forum has commiserated with the Sokoto State Government and the Sultanate over the death of Magajin Garin Sokoto, Hassan Danbaba, grandson of late Premier of the Northern Region, Sir Ahmadu Bello. The ACF, in a statement on Thursday in Kaduna, said it shared the grief of the state governor, Aminu Tambuwal; the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa`ad Abubakar; and the Sultanate Council over the sudden demise of Danbaba. ACF National Publicity Secretary, Emmanuel Yawe, stated this in the statement which he made available to journalists. Danbaba slumped and died last Saturday in Kaduna. ACF said the late Danbaba was a man who kept a very low profile and tried to disguise his high position in the society with his unusual humility. The statement said, “He died at the youth age of 51 and was completely detribalised. “He mixed freely with all Nigerians, irrespective of religion and cultural background. “We at the Arewa Consultative Forum will miss his good company and the advice and good counsel he often gave us. “May the Almighty Allah bless his soul.”
