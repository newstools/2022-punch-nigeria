A report from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service has revealed that the number of Nigerian students who applied to universities in the United Kingdom has increased by 47%. UCAS on Thursday reported that the number stood at 2,380 from 1,620 in 2021. “Nigeria, a priority country in the International Education Strategy, continues to be an emerging market showing huge growth, 47% up year-on-year at 2,380 from 1,620 in 2021,” the report revealed. The report also disclosed that  China grew by 12.1% to 28,930 applicants while “India grew by 11% year-on-year to 8,660 applicants.” Chief Executive at UCAS, Clare Marchant, said, “The application is just one part of the discovery journey and the focus must now be on ensuring applicants have the best information and advice to transition into successful students or apprentices – whatever is right for them. “The entire education sector will be continuing its high levels of support, particularly as students sit formal exams for the first time in three years. “It will be critical to support students to progress to both full-time undergraduate courses at university and college as well as degree and higher apprenticeship, as we know almost one-fifth of UCAS applicants are pursuing simultaneous applications.” “As we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and see the increased opening up of international travel, this year was always going to be pivotal for the international student market. “ Copyright PUNCH.
