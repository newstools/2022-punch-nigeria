The All Progressives Congress in Lagos State has advised the immediate past Governor of the state, Akinwunmi Ambode, against joining the Peoples Democratic Party. The Publicity Secretary of the APC in Lagos State, Seye Oladejo, said this during a chat with The PUNCH while reacting to claims by the PDP that the former governor was free to join the opposition party. Oladejo said the PDP had made it clear that Olajide Adediran, aka Jandor would be its governorship candidate in the next poll. He said Ambode should therefore not be deceived by the dubious ways of the opposition party. The Lagos APC spokesman stated, “I think the PDP is idle and the PDP is just promising people. How many governorship tickets do they want to give out? Haven’t they promised the ticket to Jandor? So they are now reaching out to Ambode? “One would expect that Mr Akinwunmi Ambode would know better than to dance to the tune of deceit in the PDP. What is the PDP’s record in governorship elections in Lagos State? Anyone who gets a PDP ticket is certain of failure.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
