No fewer than six persons lost their lives when a truck ram into the Ogbor Hill Riverside Market, popularly called Ahia Udele, in Abia State. The 40-foot trailer, which was transporting a container of fabric, was reportedly coming from the steep East Street area when it suffered a brake failure. An eyewitness, who did not want to be identified, said six persons were killed, adding that several tricycles were trapped under the wreckage. “If not that the truck driver manoeuvred the vehicle into a path in the market, it would have killed more people. “The truck was conveying a container coming from the East Street. With the way the driver was speeding, we suspected that the vehicle had brake failure. “Within seconds, the truck rammed into the market, killing Keke riders and other people in the market. More people would have died as this is a busy area,” the witness added. Rescue efforts commenced immediately as sympathisers were seen using axes to break the wreckage from where they brought out six corpses. More victims were reportedly trapped under the truck, as rescue efforts were ongoing as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
