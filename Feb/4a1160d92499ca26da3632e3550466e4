A former skipper of the Ukrainian national football team, Andriy Shevchenko, has taken to Twitter to call the attention of the world to the danger his people are subjected to following Russia’s invasion. The former Chelsea and AC Milan striker lamented that his family and people are in danger. The PUNCH had, on Thursday, reported that the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, had directed troops to invade Ukraine in what he called a “special military operation.” Airports, military bases and cities in Ukraine have been targeted by Russian missiles, tanks and warplanes with air raid sirens also heard in the capital Kyiv. Shevchenko said Ukraine wants peace, not war, as war is not the answer. “In the early hours a full scale war was initiated by Russia. My people and my family are in danger,” he wrote. “Ukraine and its population want peace and territorial integrity,” he said. He called on the world to support his country and ask the Russian government to stop violating international law. “Please I ask you to support our country and call the Russian government to stop their aggression and violation of international law. “We only want peace. War is not the answer,” he wrote. It is the second day since Russia invaded Ukraine, and there are indications that Kyiv, the capital city, is currently under a heavy attack. Copyright PUNCH.
