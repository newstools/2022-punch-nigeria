The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has called on state governors not to neglect investment on firefighting, stressing that it was their responsibility. This was as he called for the review of the law prohibiting bush burning and the mechanism for its enforcement in the country. Aregbesola said the Federal Fire Service was only meant to complement the states’ efforts and not take over their responsibilities. The Minister made this call at the Pull-Out Ceremony of the Retired Controller General of the Federal Fire Service , Dr. Liman Alhaji, in Abuja on Thursday. These were disclosed in a statement by his Media Adviser, Sola Fasure. It read, “I am repeating the call for state governments to invest more in firefighting. It is a critical social service that must not be neglected. The FFS is only complementing state efforts, not to take over their responsibility. “The law prohibiting the lazy practice of bush burning should be reviewed and made more relevant to the time. This should include the mechanism for its enforcement. I strongly believe that it should be included in the mandate of forest rangers. “The economic loss and environmental damage due to this obnoxious practice are huge and incalculable. An end must come to it.” The Minister noted that the biggest challenge of firefighting in Nigeria today was aerial firefighting campaigns for bush fires or industrial fires like what was witnessed in a departmental store in Abuja. He called on the Federal Fire Service to intensify efforts at collaborating with other relevant security agencies. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
