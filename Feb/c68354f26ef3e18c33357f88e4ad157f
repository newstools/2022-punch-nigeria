Candidates willing to participate in the 2022 Senior School Certificate Examinations organised by the National Examination Council will be registered offline and validated via their respective state offices of NECO. The council made this known in the new registration guideline made available to our correspondent in Abuja. Sunday PUNCH reports that in past years, students willing to partake in the internal and external SSCE organised by the council had to purchase scratch cards for the purpose of registration. The cards were provided by the board and made available for tokens at schools and registration centres. But the council stated that this would not be the case for the 2022 SSCE. The guideline read in part, “In order to upload your candidates’ data to the NECO portal and obtain examination numbers, all centres must register candidates offline, validate candidates from NECO state offices, and purchase quota for the number of validated candidates. “Centres must be activated after candidate validation (centre not activated cannot make payment), create/login into their online account, purchase quota for validated candidates (scratch cards are no longer used), and have a minimum of 20 candidates or pay unviable fee.” The council, however, stated that it would announce the date for the commencement of registration and release the timetable for the 2022 examinations soon.
