The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has again assured Nigerians that the trial of some identified terrorism financiers would soon commence. Malami, who spoke during an interview with Channels Television’s ‘Politics Today’ on Monday, monitored by The PUNCH, assured again that those found to have committed the crime would soon be charged. “It has been a work in progress. Prima facie case seems to have been established, but proof of evidence has to be developed and eventually prosecution will take place,” Malami explained after several of such promises to arraign the suspects failed in the past. “So, there is nothing that is hidden as far as prosecution is concerned; it is traditionally a public prosecution,” the AGF said against the backdrop of recent allegations of government compromise in bringing alleged sponsors of terrorism to justice.” He, however, refused to disclose the identities of the suspects. “In a couple of weeks, these people will be charged and arraigned in court. In a number of weeks, you will have something tangible and cogent by way of prosecution,” the minister added.
