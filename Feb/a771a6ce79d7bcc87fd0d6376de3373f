The Diaspora Chairmen Forum of the All Progressives Congress has faulted the proposed amendment of the party’s constitution. The forum’s Secretary, Mr Ayoola Lawal, in a statement on Monday, said members of the party in the Diaspora were not in support of the proposed constitutional amendment by the party. The statement partly read, “We have sighted the recently released proposed amended constitution of our party and as leaders of the party in the Diaspora, we express the deep disappointment of Nigerians in the Diaspora who we represent over this recent attempt to completely obliterate any iota of cohesive and functional participation by Nigerians in the Diaspora as members of our beloved party, the APC. “The treatment by the constitution amendment committee to the diaspora compatriots as members of the APC is quite difficult to understand. We strongly believe allowing such to stay as recommended in the proposed constitution will promote acrimony, instability, and loss of united operational focus and outcomes in the diaspora chapters of the APC. “By way of reminder, we made definite suggestions on the diaspora proper inclusion in the party organs that promotes diaspora Inclusion, and engagement, and a structured reward system for our members to strengthen our party in the Diaspora Nigerian community. “Our contributions to the committee are a true reflection of the agitations of our members for party recognition, and our years of experience managing the affairs of our party since inception as well as members of the legacy parties that gave birth to the APC.” Copyright PUNCH.
