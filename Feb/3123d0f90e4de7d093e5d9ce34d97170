The General Manager, Lagos State Planning and Environmental Monitoring Authority, Mr Daisi Oso, has warned against encroachments on open spaces in some parts of the state. Oso said this in a statement on Monday, adding that the agency will soon take appropriate actions against violators. He said, “First and foremost, we will enlighten the public that the setbacks are not where anyone can just occupy because they are for future expansion. Some of the government utilities and infrastructure pass through such corridors and they are so designed in the regional and other developmental plans with the intent of beautifying urban spaces to enhance Lagos State aesthetics. “It is quite alarming to see our people putting up permanent structures and opening their fences onto these setbacks, especially on Admiralty Way in Lekki Phase I. This will not be allowed. It is totally unacceptable and flagrant infractions on these incidental spaces.” Oso added urged those encroaching on open spaces to move their structures as these places are critical to making Lagos a smart city. “I implore all those that have encroached on the setbacks and incidental open spaces to remove such structures, since the agency grants temporary use of spaces as predetermined and designed to people who are in need of such facility,” he added.
