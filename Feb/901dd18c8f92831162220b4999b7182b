The Divisional Police Officer for Jibiya Local Government Area of Katsina State, DSP Abdullahi Rano, was shot and killed early Wednesday morning by terrorists who invaded Magama-Jibia border town. The Divisional Police Officer was said to have led a reinforcement of the police and the Nigerian Army to engage the terrorists in a fierce shoot-out during which he was shot and killed. The Spokesman for the Katsina Police Command, SP Gambo Isah, did not pick up his calls and was yet to respond to the SMS sent to him inquiring about the incident. The PPRO, however, posted the picture of the late DPO on his WhatsApp platform with a label ‘RIP’ on it. Residents disclosed that a soldier was injured during the attack. A Deputy village head of Mazanya, Abubakar Sani, confirmed the attack which began at 2am. Another opinion leader in Magama-Jibia who pleaded anonymity also confirmed the incident, adding that the situation was already calm in the town as of 9am on Wednesday, with security personnel patrolling the community. It was learnt that the terrorists stormed the town in numbers and started shooting sporadically. Residents further disclosed that the terrorists first visited the house of one Haliru Mai Bakin Mai located at Magama-Jibia and abducted his wife. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
