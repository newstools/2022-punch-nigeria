Globacom has unveiled a special season of its Smartphone Festival designed to ensure that its subscribers have a memorable and delightful Valentine season. According to the statement by the company over the weekend, subscribers will receive up to 36GB of free data which they can share with their loved ones when they purchase two smartphones from Globacom’s retail outlets located in several cities across the country. The offer which was said to have begun on February 10 would end on February 25, 2022, while the data slabs to be enjoyed would be determined by the price of the particular Smartphone purchased by the subscriber, the telecom operator explained. Globacom stated, “The subscriber is rest assured of the genuineness of the phones which come with warranties and after sales support from the manufacturers. The prices at the Gloworld outlets are also the most competitive in the market”. “This offer is our way of adding flavour to our customers’ Valentine Season enjoyment.  We expect that they will be engaged in a lot of online activities before and around February 14, so we decided to make it easier for them to buy genuine devices at affordable prices for themselves and their loved ones”, the company noted.
