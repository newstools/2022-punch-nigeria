The member representing the Ado-Odo Ota Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Jimoh Ojugbele, has called for the creation of the Awori Traditional Council. This, according to him, is long overdue for the development and the unification of the Awori people. The lawmaker, who was represented by his senior legislative aide, Chief Yomi Olojeloju, made this call in a welcome address at the commencement of a three-day retreat organised for Awori obas by the Awori Obas Forum themed, ‘Thinking Awori Nation in the face of security, democracy and COVID-19 pandemic’. Ojugbele stressed that the creation of the traditional council would help the Awori to maintain their identity. He added that the Awori were long overdue to have their own paramount ruler. The lawmaker also described attending of statutory meetings of monarchs from the Ota constituency in the Egba and Yewa traditional councils as “absurd and unthinkable.” Ojugbele stated, “Our clamour and agitation for the Awori Traditional Council has been on from time immemorial. On our part as the political class, it has been a war. “We are never pleased having our Obas operating under the Egba and Yewa traditional councils. It is absurd and unthinkable, having our Obas in the Ota constituency attending statutory meetings in Egba and those in the Ado-Igbesa Constituency having theirs under the Yewa Traditional Council. “This, to me, is very strategic in making us not to have a stronger front.” The Secretary and Legal Adviser of the Awori Obas’ Forum and also the Alagbara of Agbara land, Oba Lukman Agunbiade, said the purpose for the retreat was to foster unity among the monarchs.
