A scholar, Prof. Chris Imumolen, has said strike in universities is an action that is no longer in vogue globally. Imumolen in a statement titled, ’state of the nation on education: ASUU Strike, insecurity and crime economy: fuel scarcity’, maintained that the ongoing Academic Staff Union of Universities strike was an issue that should keep the government on its feet. “Strike is an action that has stopped all over the world. The ASUU strike is a major issue that should keep a sensible government on its feet. “The challenges we are facing is leadership, insecurity, education, and the recent ASUU strike. It is unfortunate we have to go through hardship to survive in this country.” He urged government officials and politicians to patronise Nigerian schools. “Education shouldn’t be seen as an avenue to make money. It is important to make Nigeria competitive with other countries. Nigerians can develop this country. Government officials should patronise Nigerian schools; that way, they will make sure everything goes well,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
