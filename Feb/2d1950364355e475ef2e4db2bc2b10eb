The Lagos State Head of Service, Mr Hakeem Muri-Okunola, has urged members of staff of the Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board to exhibit the highest sense of commitment in their duties. The HoS made this call in a statement on Monday, saying the government was committed to the development of basic education in the state. Muri-Okunola, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Education District II, Mrs Anike Adekanye, was quoted to have said this during an award event to honour outstanding teaching and non-teaching members of staff in Ikeja. He said, “The essence of this gathering is to recognise those who have served the state diligently and conscientiously in the past. I want to congratulate the awardees and urge them not to rest on their oars but continue to exhibit a high sense of responsibility, commitment and unalloyed loyalty in the discharge of their duties. “I highly appreciate Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for his unwavering commitment to the motivation, welfare and well-being of employees and also commend LASUBEB for her giant strides towards the development of basic education in the state.” The Executive Chairman of LASUBEB, Mr Wahab Alawiye-King, explained that the board would continue to upgrade the standard of education by appreciating the efforts of workers in the state. “We are here to recognise, appreciate, commend and encourage these members of staff drawn from the board headquarters, Local Government Education Authority and primary schools and encourage them to continue to do their best,” he said.
