The Lagos State Government has said it is committed to raising awareness on the importance of protecting wetlands amidst increasing population in the state. The state Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, said this in a statement on Sunday. He said, “Wetlands are known to be natural purifiers but the wetlands in Lagos State are facing an unprecedented pressure for housing occasioned by an increasing human population leading to sand-filling and consequential loss of the wetlands. “This calls for the adoption of best practices to protect the ecosystem across the state in addition to making concerted efforts to restore wetlands which is also a good source of fresh water. “Wetlands have been threatened for decades with 35 per cent of it lost since 1970 and another 74 per cent of the planet’s surface altered by human actions and some of the consequences of unsustainable use of wetlands include water scarcity, exposure to flooding and extreme weather conditions, loss of livelihood and food insecurity.” Bello added that the government would tackle wetlands decline through proper monitoring and advocacy. “The state government will continue to address wetland quality decline through wetland restoration plans such as routine monitoring of the identified wetlands and aggressive public awareness/advocacy campaigns,” he said.
