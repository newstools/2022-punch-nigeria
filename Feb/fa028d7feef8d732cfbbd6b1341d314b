An Enugu State Magistrate Court has remanded 49-year-old Remigius Nwaju in Enugu Correctional Centre for allegedly killing his wife, Philomena Nwaju. The accused was said to have committed the offence on November 15, 2021 at No. 7 Ajali Crescent Independence Layout, Enugu. In a court document our correspondent sighted on Sunday, Nwaju was arraigned on two-count charge before Chief Magistrate Ngozi Edeani in charge No CME/15C/2022. The accused could not take his plea when the charge was read to him because the court has no jurisdiction to entertain a murder case. He was subsequently remanded in correctional centre by the chief magistrate who ordered that the case file be transmitted to the Director of Public Prosecution for advice. The case was subsequently adjourned to February 23, 2022 to consider the report from the DPP.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
