The Visa Everywhere Initiative, a global open innovation program, has opened applications for fintechs and payment startups in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa to showcase their products and solutions for a total of $45,000 in prize money. According to the company, finalists will get exposure to key fintech stakeholders across banking, merchant, VC and government sectors. It added that this year’s programme had been expanded to include startups using cryptocurrency and Visa Direct. The Vice President, Visa West Africa, Kemi Okusanya, said, “Fintechs and other payments innovators are transforming the way consumers and businesses make payments, making it easier for more people to access the money they need when they need it – and the pandemic has seen this become more critical than ever.” The company added that its VEI network had helped startups from over 100 countries collectively raise more than $2.5bn in funding and included 8,500 startups from around the world. It said this year’s programme would focus on Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa as its latest edition saw two new editions in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, as well as a global finale in Qatar later in 2022.
