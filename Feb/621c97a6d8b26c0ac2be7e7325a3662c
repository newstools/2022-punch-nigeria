The Federal Ministry of Education has commenced a move to meet one of the demands of the Academic Staff Union of Universities. The ministry disclosed this in a press statement issued by its Director of Press and Media Relations, Ben Goong, on Thursday. The PUNCH observed that the move by the government to inaugurate a white paper drafting panel came almost a year after the visiting panels to tertiary institutions constituted by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari(retd.), submitted the reports of their findings to the education ministry. The visiting panel, which was inaugurated by the President, was to look into the lapses in the administration of universities. One of ASUU’s demands is the release of the White Paper panel report. A press statement from the education ministry titled, ‘Federal Government constitutes white paper drafting panels for tertiary institutions, explained that ten white paper drafting panels have been constituted. The statement read in part, “Following the receipt of reports of Visitation Panels to Tertiary Institutions last year, Education Minister, Adamu Adamu has constituted White Paper Drafting Panels for Tertiary Institutions across the country. “Ten White Paper Drafting Panels have been constituted for 36 Universities, while six Panels have been constituted for 25 Polytechnics with 21 Colleges of Education having 5 Panels. “One Panel is to draft a White Paper for four Inter-university centres. the Panels will be inaugurated in the coming days. “All the Panels have two weeks from the date of inauguration to submit their reports.” The ASUU President, Prof Emmanuel Osodeke, could not be reached for his comments as of the time of filing this report.
