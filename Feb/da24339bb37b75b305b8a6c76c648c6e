Nigerian actress and media personality, Toke Makinwa, has shared her unpleasant experience at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, due to poor ventilation. Makinwa tweeted on Monday that on arrival at the airport, she was met with heat at the arrival section which had no functioning air conditioners. The Big Brother Naija host also lamented about the officers who had to endure the heat on a daily basis. “Touch down Lagos Nigeria and the heat at the airport is insane, why will the A/C at arrivals not work??? The fans blowing hot air and the officers having to work under such circumstances is sad. What a country. “I’m standing at arrivals dripping in sweat and all I can think is the officers in the box who have to endure this daily. “Like we have all just accepted this as normal cos we go into our cars with A/C’s after, but these people who work here under such harsh conditions are human too,” she said. The actress also pointed out that the conditions the officers have to work in could be the reason “they take out their anger and impatience on travellers.” “You enter Nigeria and pick up stress,” she wrote.
