Bayero University Kano is to establish an ultra-modern television station as part of activities marking its 40th anniversary. Briefing journalists on Wednesday at a press conference organised by the Department of Mass Communication, the Alumni Caretaker Committee Chairman, Dr Abubakar Minijibir, said the university had since established a digitalised radio station comparable to the standard of the British Broadcasting Corporation and other international radio stations worldwide. According to him, the 40th anniversary is worth celebrating, adding that the Department of Mass Communication has produced outstanding graduates who are currently occupying top positions in the relevant fields of specialisation. “The first correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria in London is a product of the Bayero University Kano Mass Communication Department, and other establishments, too numerous to mention,” he said. He disclosed that BUK started training in Mass Communication since 1978, adding that the institution was the third among universities to establish the Department of Mass Communication. “It is therefore worthwhile to float an Alumni Association of Mass Communication graduates from BUK. It will serve as an avenue for the reunion of old time school mates to rob minds,” he added.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
