American rapper, Travis Scott, and reality TV star, Kylie Jenner, have welcomed their second child together. Jenner announced the good news as she shared a black and white picture in which the baby’s hand is being held by an older person’s hand. Sharing a blue love emoji, she captioned the picture “2/2/22”, which implied that she welcomed her baby last Wednesday. Her family members and fans took to the comment session to congratulate the new mum on her baby delivery. Kylie’s mum wrote, “Angel Pie” while her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, wrote, “Mother of two life (sic)”. Khloe and Kim Kardashian also congratulated Kylie with blue love emojis. In an emotional video that shows different stages of the pregnancy, Kylie had in September 2021 confirmed that she was expecting another child with Scott, her lover and father of her first child, Stormie. However, the makeup mogul had earlier kept silent about the speculations of a second pregnancy which emerged in August last year. The makeup mogul and the rapper welcomed their first child, Stormie, in 2018. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
