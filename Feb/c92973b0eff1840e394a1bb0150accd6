Members of the Nigeria Association of Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture Business Women Group have been trained on public procurement and business development. The training tagged “Positioning South-West women-owned businesses for public procurement” was facilitated by Nigeria Export Promotion Council through a Federal Government initiative, Export Expansion Facility Programme. The Director-General of Odu’a Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture, Mr. David Awotipe, said the training was aimed at sensitising women drawn from South-West states on how to improve, prepare and participate in public procurement. Awotipe said the organised private sector in South-West recognises the significant contributions of women in business to the economic development of the region, adding that the training would further encourage them to do more. The NAWORG National Chairperson, Hajia Aisha Abubakar, the NAWORG Southwest West Zonal Coordinator, Barrister Oluwayimika Olumilua, the President of ODUACCIMA, Prince Kayode Adeyemi, and the Vice President of NACCIMA, Chief Kola Akosile while speaking during the training lauded the initiative.
