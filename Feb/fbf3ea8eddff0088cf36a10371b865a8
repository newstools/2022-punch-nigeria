The Benue State Government has disclosed that plans are been concluded to access a $3million counterpart fund for immunization programmes across the state. The State Governor, Samuel Ortom, disclosed this on Friday while flagging off the Polio Outbreak Response Vaccination Campaign in Makurdi. The governor was represented by the Commissioner for Health and Human Services, Dr. Joseph Ngbea, at the event. According to him, our administration has already paid the sum of $100,000 counterpart fund to access the fund and it is interesting to note that resources committed to polio eradication in the state were yielding positive results. “The state government is taking most of the programmes of primary healthcare very seriously to actualize the eradication of polio virus and childhood killer diseases in the state. “We have already inaugurated a task-force on immunization and have also gone ahead to pay the counterpart fund of $100,000 so that we can access $3million for immunization. “That was done just last week and we are going to do more when it comes to counterpart fund because its importance cannot be over emphasized and government ensures it is paid as and when due so that we access additional funds for activities in the sector.” Furthermore, the governor urged parents to ensure that children under five years were vaccinated in the round of immunization. He explained that the government was putting modalities in place to recruit needed personnel in Benue’s health sector.
