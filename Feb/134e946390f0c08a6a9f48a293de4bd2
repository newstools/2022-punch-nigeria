The Managing Director of West Africa Container Terminal Nigeria, Naved Zafar, has commended the Nigeria Customs Service for installing a new scanning machine at the Onne Port Complex. A statement on Thursday noted that the new scanning machine was acquired by the Federal Government in September 2021 and inaugurated last week by the Comptroller-General of Customs, Col. Hameed Ali (retd.). Ali was quoted as saying the scanner would facilitate trade, ensure security and drastically reduce the importation of illicit goods by unscrupulous persons. Zafar, who attended the inauguration ceremony at the port, said the scanner would aid manifest verification, Customs tariff collection and the identification of contraband. He said WACT would offer necessary support to NCS to optimise the benefits of the scanning machine. He said, “We are delighted with the commissioning of this scanner. I believe it has the potential of making a lot of difference by facilitating faster and easier delivery of cargo. We have long prepared for this. “As part of our Terminal Upgrade and Expansion project, we have acquired sufficient cargo handling equipment at our terminal to improve the efficiency of the port and the new scanning machine will complement our effort in this regard.” According to Zafar, the upgrade of the terminal is on course.
