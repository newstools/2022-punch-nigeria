Following the killings of nine persons in Abia State at the cattle market, the state government on Monday sent a delegation to condole families of the bereaved in Gombe State. The government also sympatised with the Gombe State Government over the killings of seven northern traders in a recent attack on the Abia cattle market. Kalu Ogbu, the Paramount Ruler of Abriba who represented Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, expressed sadness at the killings. “I’m here to extend our sympathy and condolences of the people and government of Abia State. It was sad and I don’t know how to explain it. There is no word to explain what happened as it was the handiwork of misguided fellows. Thank God our governor has taken up the responsibilities to make sure those behind it are caught to face the wrath of the law,” he said. According to Acting President Cattle Dealers Association of Nigeria, Yahuza Yusuf, no government from the South has shown sympathy to the association like the Abia State governor. “We asked him to pay for our damages he said he can’t pay all our damage but he gave us at least each cow N150,000 but he promised to support affected families survive, promised additional N2 million to families but he is yet to pay,” Yusuf said. Speaking, Deputy Governor of Gombe State, Manassah Jatau, who represented Governor Muhammadu Yahaya, blamed the recent killings on the abandonment of culture and religious tenets. He said, “We are now engaging in so many things that are unexplainable, you can’t explain what is happening. Today, we are witnessing the reverse of things and I will attribute it to the abandonment of culture and possibly our religious leaders must have failed.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
