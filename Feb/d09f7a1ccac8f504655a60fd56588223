The Kano State Government has approved the constitution of a committee to draft a harmonised retirement age for teachers in the state effective January 2022. The state Commissioner for Information, Muhammad Garba, announced this in a statement made available to journalists in Kano on Sunday. Garba said the approval was part of the outcome of the weekly State Executive Council meeting, held at the Africa House, Government House, Kano. He, however, said while the extension would require increase in personnel cost (salaries) and other emolument for teachers which were not provided for in the 2021 budget, there was the need to start the new policy this year. Garba pointed out that the committee had also been mandated to review the scheme and condition of service in the state with a view to accommodating the new retirement age of teachers from 35 years of service and 60 years of age to 40 years of service and 65 years of age respectively. The commissioner added that the council had given approval for the release of N23.3 million for the construction of one block of four classrooms and one block of six-seater VIP toilets at Farawa community in Kumbotso Local Government Area. He also revealed that the council has approved the award of a contract worth N344 million to Harmonise Systems Limited for the procurement of 100 Hyundai 2010 cars under the pilot Kano Bus Mass Transit Project. He said the council approved the recruitment of 704 forest guards/forest range officers on casual basis for the 404 grazing reserves under the state Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources and 300 for the forest estates under the Ministry of Environment.
