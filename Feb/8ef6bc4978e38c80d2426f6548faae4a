Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, on Thursday, condemned the violent clash between the Tiv and Jukun communities in the Makurdi riverside over ownership of fish ponds in the area. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Nathaniel Ikyur, called on the two communities to cease hostilities without delay. Two persons were reportedly inflicted with severe injuries from the violent clash on Wednesday over the battle for the ownership of fish ponds in the Wurukun area of Makurdi. The traditional ruler of the community was said to have fled to an unknown destination after his home was set ablaze by rampaging youths and many houses were burnt during the clash. Ortom, who expressed sadness over the crisis, directed security operatives to take control of the area and do all necessary to arrest the perpetrators of the mayhem. He stated, “The perpetrators of the violent clash that led to the several injuries and property destroyed must be brought to justice. We cannot tolerate a situation where people take the law into their own hands. “No matter the amount of anger in a man’s mind, resorting to violence cannot be a solution. Resorting to self-help can only aggravate the situation. There are many legitimate channels to resolve disputes. No one should take the law into their own hands.” The governor warned that the government would bring the full weight of the law on anybody or community perpetrating violence and disrupting the peace of the land henceforth. He urged the people to be law-abiding just as he assured them that the government would continue to create a conducive atmosphere for everyone to carry out their legitimate business in the state.
