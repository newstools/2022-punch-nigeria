The Indigenous People of Biafra has said that its earlier decision banning the movement and consumption of Fulani cows in the South-East from April 2022 still stands. The group also clarified its stand that the decision was not borne out of hate but to safeguard its land and the people from the “evil agenda of the Fulani.” The group made its position known in a statement on Monday by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful. “Our decision is borne out of the natural desire to preserve our race from being wiped out by the Fulani terrorist herdsmen,” the group said. It said it would no longer tolerate the “criminal” silence and the failure of the Federal Government to protect its territories against attacks. The statement read, “Our patience has been over stretched beyond its elasticity point. We can no longer afford to fold our arms and be waiting for the last man in Biafra land to be killed by those masquerading as herdsmen. “Our people waste huge sums of money up to N3bn every year on cow meat and we will not allow that to continue. We, therefore, encourage those who have the money to start breeding our local cows (Efi Igbo) and other farming; IPOB will support them to boost the farming and animal husbandry business.” While advising those dealing in Fulani cow meat to look for alternative before the April due date, the group said the decision was in the collective interest of the South-East people.
