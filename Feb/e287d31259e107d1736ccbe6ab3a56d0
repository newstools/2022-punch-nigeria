A presidential aspirant of the Africa Democratic Congress, Mr Chukwuka Monye says he is looking forward to a debate with the All Progressives Congress presidential hopeful, Bola Tinubu, Peoples Democratic Party aspirant, Atiku Abubakar, and others in the forthcoming election. Receiving his ADC membership card in Asaba on Friday, Monye maintained that he may not have money to throw around like the other aspirants but stressed that he possessed the solution to Nigeria’s problem. He said, “Prior to announcing my presidential interest January 15, 2022, I consulted both young and old. After analysing all political parties, I find out that ADC has the ideology of restoring the dignity and value of Nigerians. “I may not have money to throw around like our big aspirants in APC and PDP; I want to tell you that throwing money will not solve the problem of Nigeria. Therefore, I am looking forward to a debate with APC and PDP aspirants.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
