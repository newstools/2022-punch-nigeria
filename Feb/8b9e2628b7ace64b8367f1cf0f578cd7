American reality TV star, Kim Kardashian, in fresh court documents, has revealed that Instagram posts of her estranged husband, Kanye West, caused her emotional distress. In the court documents obtained by TMZ, Kardashian reaffirmed her desire to become divorced as she blamed West for failing to keep their separation plans secret as she planned. “I very much desire to be divorced,” Kardashian said. According to her, she had asked Kanye to keep their divorce private, “but he has not done so.” She added, “Kanye has been putting a lot of misinformation regarding our private matters and co-parenting on social media which has created emotional distress.” In now-deleted Instagram posts, Kanye had accused the entrepreneur of kidnapping their daughter, Chicago, and accused her of saying he was trying to kill her. Kanye had also opposed Kardashian’s divorce petition as he wanted them to ensure their assets were safeguarded before she was declared single. Reaffirming her desire to become single again, she said, “While I wish our marriage would have succeeded, I have come to the realisation that there is no way to repair our marriage. Kanye does not agree but at least it appears that he has come to the realisation that I want to end our marriage, even if he does not.” Despite the year-long divorce battle, the duo had moved on with several romantic relationships. Kanye had had a romantic relationship with actress Julia Fox while comedian and show host, Pete Davidson, recently called Kim his girlfriend. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
