Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Tuesday paid a condolence visit to the family of the kidnapped and murdered Kano pupil, Hanifa Abubakar, in Kano State. Osinbajo, who was accompanied by the state governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, and some members of the National Assembly, expressed condolences on behalf of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and himself to the family. According to a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, prayers were also offered for the departed during the visit. The statement noted that the father of the slain schoolgirl, Alhaji Abubakar, expressed gratitude to the President and Osinbajo for the visit. The bereaved father was quoted as saying that, “I am rather speechless, I don’t have enough words to quantify my joy and gratitude over the visit of the Vice President to my family to condole me. “As I told him, it should be the other way round. The Vice President is our father; we are supposed to go and pay him a visit, not him coming to us. “However, I am grateful, I am sincerely honoured. The only thing I will say is to pray for him and the entire nation, that peace will reign.” According to the statement, Osinbajo had earlier attended the 53rd conference of the National Association of Law Teachers, held at Bayero University. Speaking at the event, he emphasised the need to preserve democratic institutions and uphold social justice in Nigeria and other parts of Africa. He also promised that the present regime will continue to ramp up its efforts in social welfare and expanding universal health insurance to ensure that the country’s most vulnerable citizens are not abandoned to the vicissitudes of fate.
