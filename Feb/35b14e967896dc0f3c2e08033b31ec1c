The much anticipated “SNEAKER BALL” organised by Sneakerfest held on Saturday 29th January, 2022 at the Lagos Oriental Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos, Nigeria. The event was aimed at further promoting the Sneaker Culture in Nigeria by making Sneaker Enthusiasts more concious of the Sneaker Lifestyle while celebrating young Nigerians who have shown mastery in the arts. Sneaker Ball featured Rap Battles, Sneakers Giveaways, Dance Contest, spoken word and Sneakers Display, and an electrifying performance from the chart-topping Nigerian artiste and Holy father crooner, Victony.  Highlight of the Event was a Tribute to the late multi-award winning and selling Nigerian Rapper and Singer, Sound Sultan who used his platform to promote Basketball and gave birth to the current Nigerian HipHop. According to Sneaker Collector and Convener, Ikemesit Nkereuwem-Tim, SNEAKER BALL also aims to bridge the GAP between the Nigerian People and The Government to create a better understanding of the youth and their expectations by the Government and vice versa. Hence the event had the Nigerian Military, Brands and Youths seated together celebrating each other under same roof.  The Brands and Relations Manager, Babajide Agboola revealed that Next on the SNEAKERFEST Calendar for 2022 is the SLAM DUNK Contest proposed for Easter 2022.
