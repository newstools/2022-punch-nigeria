The Controller General of the Nigerian Correctional Service, Haliru Nababa, has denied deploying officials of the service for the ongoing All Progressives Congress governorship primary election holding (today) in Osun State. He stated that his personnel has no role to play in the election, adding that the primary duty of the service is to provide security in and around custodial centres across the country. Nababa, however, directed that anyone found in the service’s uniform at the primary election venue or playing any role in the exercise should be arrested. These were contained in a statement on Saturday by the spokesperson of the Service, Francis Enobore. The statement was titled, “Osun Primary Election: NCoS Officials have no Role to Play”. It read, ” The attention of the management of the Nigerian Correctional Service has been drawn to a statement credited to some individuals insinuating that officers of the Correctional Service have been mobilised for the purpose of causing chaos and rig the gubernatorial primary election in Osun State. “This is not true as Corrections officers have no role to play in the said election therefore, no such deployment was ordered by the management. “For the avoidance of doubt, the focus of personnel of the Service remains providing security in and around Custodial Centres, therefore, the Controller-General of Corrections, Haliru Nababa has directed the immediate arrest of anyone found in the Service’s uniform at the primary election venue or playing any role in the exercise.” Copyright PUNCH.
