Retired Clerk to the Senate, Ibrahim el-Ladan, continued official duties at the plenary on Tuesday to the shock and disbelief of members of the chamber. President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, allowed el-Ladan, who was relieved of his job by the National Assembly Service Commission last week, to sit at the table and continue the work of a clerk. The NASC had retired el-Ladan and two permanent secretaries, Anthony Adebanjo and Michael Opara, over alleged forgery of documents and age falsification. The commission had ordered el-Ladan and Adebanjo to proceed on retirement with immediate effect, while Okpara was asked to retire in six months. The NASC had also gone ahead to appoint Mrs Isabella Iloba as acting Clerk to the Senate, to take over from el-Ladan. The Executive Chairman of the NASC, Ahmed Amshi, convey the message in a letter dated February 9, 2022, with Reference Number NASC/PF/69/184, titled ‘Retirement from Service,’ and addressed to el-Ladan, a copy of which our correspondent sighted on Tuesday. It partly read, “The Commission at its 547th meeting held on Wednesday, February 9, 2022, has approved your retirement from service with effect from February 9, 2022. “The commission wishes to acknowledge your immense contribution to the growth and development of the National Assembly Service. “As you proceed on retirement, please hand over your office and other government property in your possession to the Deputy Clerk, Senate (Legislative), Ilobah Ugochi.” However, el-Ladan carried on with official duties in the chamber on Tuesday unhindered. The Director of Information, NASC, Mrs Janet Mambula, could not be reached for comments as of press time on Tuesday. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
