Dr Ademola Bayonle, a 35 -year- old medical doctor, has joined the race for the July 16 Osun governorship election, under the platform of the Young Progressive Party. Bayonle said this when he spoke with newsmen shortly after receiving his nomination form at the YPP’s National Secretariat in Abuja on Saturday. He said that youths were in a better position to change the narrative of Nigerian politics through active participation. “Osun election is giving the youth an opportunity to set the pace for Ekiti election, ahead of the 2023 general elections. “We need to take the bull by the horn to ensure that the older generation leaves behind a good structure, because if we allow them to continue to make decisions for us, thirty years from now when they are gone, we will be the ones to suffer the consequences. “So now is the time to join and make an impact for the future we want for ourselves and for the next generation,” he said. Bayonle urged youths to join the YPP because it’s the party for them. “A mistake often made by youths is believing that taking part in politics involves money to pick tickets to run for offices. “Participation goes beyond running for offices, participation means joining rallies, campaigns, engaging in dialogues, and others. There are so many false perceptions about joining politics or participating in politics. “Politics goes beyond money, some people started the “Not-Too-Young-To-Run” campaign and that is participation. “Some people start conversations on social media and people listen to them and learn they learn one or two things and that is also participation. “So, I encourage youths to join vibrant political parties like the YPP and to be in positions where even if you are not contesting and picking a form as I am doing today, but you are engaging with other youths on politics,” he said.
