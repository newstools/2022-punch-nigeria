The National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party, on Friday, postponed its North-West Zonal Congress earlier scheduled for Saturday, February 12, 2022. This is according to a statement signed by the party’s National Organising Secretary, Umar Bature, titled, ‘Postponement of North-West Zonal Congress’. Bature said, “The National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party wishes to announce the postponement of our scheduled North-West Zonal Congress earlier slated for Saturday, February 12, 2022. “A new date will be communicated in due course. “INEC, all aspirants, delegates, and critical stakeholders are to note accordingly, please.” Although the party did not expressly state the reasons for the abrupt postponement, it might not be unconnected to the 2022 Federal Capital Territory Area Council Elections, which hold on the same date.
