Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State said on Friday that his intention of having a united and strong party is still on. Ganduje stated this while addressing party supporters shortly after returning from Abuja, where a Court of Appeal confirmed Abdullahi Abbas as the party chairman. “What recently transpired between party members was purely internal party wrangling. “We are assuring you that our intention of a united and strong party is still on. “APC is solid in Kano State, it is the strongest party in Kano State. “And we assure you that APC is still one, what happened is mere controversy among children of the same parents. “We invite those who took us to court to come together so that we will continue to build a solid political party. “I want to assure everyone that our doors are still open, we embrace democracy, we embrace unity. “Our great party, APC, is still one in Kano. All controversies are over as the Court of Appeal has confirmed the leadership of Abdullahi Abbas,” he said. The governor said that they would sit with all party leaders across the 44 local governments to discuss strategies that would assist to strengthen party structures. Ganduje also revealed that members are ready for the forthcoming party National Convention. In his remarks, the State Chairman of the APC, Alhaji Abdullahi Abbas, assured that he will carry all party members along and run an open-door policy. He thanked members for their continuous support, urging them to keep up the good efforts. (NAN)
