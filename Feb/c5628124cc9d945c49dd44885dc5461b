The Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, has revealed that he and two of his children have tested positive for COVID-19. Trudeau disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday, reminding all Canadians to get vaccinated as the pandemic is not yet over. He said, “I know it is frustrating that after two years, the battle against COVID-19 is still dominating so many parts of our lives. Two of my own children have now contracted it, and this morning, I learned that I tested positive for COVID-19 as well. “I am feeling fine and have no symptoms – and I will continue to work remotely this week while following public health guidelines. It’s a big challenge that my family and I are facing, but there’s nothing unusual. It is a challenge too many Canadians and people around the world know all too well – and a chance to remind all Canadians to get vaccinated. This pandemic is not over, and we have to be there for one another.” The Prime Minister also condemned the protests which occurred in Ottawa, describing it as “dishonour” to the memory of the nation’s veterans. He added, “And as we continue to have each other’s backs, I also know you are wondering about what you saw in your capital city this weekend. Over the past few days, Canadians were shocked, and frankly, disgusted, by the behaviour displayed by some people protesting.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
