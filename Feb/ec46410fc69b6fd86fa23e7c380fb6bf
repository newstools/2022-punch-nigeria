The lawmaker representing lseyin/ltesiwaju/ Kajola/lwajowa Federal Constituency in Oyo State at the House of Representatives, Shina Peller, has proposed scrapping of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps. Peller proposed that the Nigeria Police Force to take over the responsibilities of the NSCDC. The lawmaker made the proposal to the House via the National Security And Civil Defence Corps (Repeal and Transition) Bill 2022, which passed first reading on Tuesday. The bill seeks to repeal the National Security and Civil Defence Corps (Amendment) Act 2007, establish a transition management committee to superintend over the NSCDC, develop regulations and implement procedures for the transfer of assets and personnel of the corps to the Nigeria Police Force, and other related matters. In the bill, Peller noted that “fragmentation of security resources across multiple competing agencies is counterproductive.” The lawmakers also noted that the mandate of the NSCDC “has now become a duplication of the Nigeria Police Force,” adding, “this has led to avoidable conflicts.” Peller stated, “Every single function of the NSCDC can be done or is being done by the Nigeria Police Force,” while citing “waste of scarce resources,” stressing that the annual budget of the NSCDC is almost N100bn. “The assets and personnel of the NSCDC will be absorbed by the Nigeria Police. So, no loss of jobs,” he noted. The NSCDC, which was a voluntary organisation, was converted to a national security outfit by the Olusegun Obasanjo administration. The bill came at a time when the National Assembly is considering or has passed bills to establish more security outfits such as the Peace Corps and Vigilante Group of Nigeria. Copyright PUNCH.
