Cameroon and Egypt went into extra time in their Africa Cup of Nations semi-final in Yaounde on Thursday as the game ended 0-0 after 90 minutes. Michael Ngadeu and Samuel Oum Gouet both hit the woodwork for the host nation at the Olembe Stadium, while Egypt skipper Mohamed Salah was denied by Andre Onana after finding himself through with just the goalkeeper to beat. Egypt coach Carlos Queiroz was shown a red card as the match went into stoppage time. FINAL: Egypt won 3-1 on penalties There are no teams that won Africa Cup of Nations titles other than Cameroon and Egypt. Between them, they lifted the Holy Grail of African Football twelve times, seven for the Pharaohs and five for the Indomitable Lions. On Thursday, they are seeking a place in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations final when they lock horns in Yaoundé. The Pharaohs seem to own almost all of AFCON’s historic records, but there’s one that they are desperate to extend, winning their eighth title. After a sluggish group stage campaign, Egypt rose to the expectations to oust Cote d’Ivoire and Morocco and reach the semifinals in style. Now they have to face another tough hurdle in the form of their hosts. The Pharaohs look up again to their star captain Mohamed Salah, who scored twice to the moment, and assisted the winner in the quarterfinals against Morocco but he is yet to sparkle. Cameroon once again rely on the lethal attacking duo of Vincent Abubakar and Karl Toko Ekambi, who has scored all Cameroon 11 goals to the moment, six for Abubakar and one less for Ekambi.
