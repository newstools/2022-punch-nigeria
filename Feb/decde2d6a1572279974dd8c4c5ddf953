Travellers and motorists, on Wednesday, stranded as students of D.S. Adegbenro ICT Polytechnic, Itori in Ogun State, blocked the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway. Many travellers and motorists who plied the road on Wednesday were stranded due to the protest. The angry students blocked the road to protest the alleged abduction of two of their colleagues by suspected gunmen. It was gathered that unknown gunmen attacked a hostel around 1am at Afowowa, Ewekoro Local Government Area of Ogun State. The students said they were angry because the police allegedly refused to respond to distress calls. They lamented that the attack on their colleagues lasted for almost four hours, unhindered. One of the protesting students, who pleaded anonymity, said, “The gunmen attacked a hostel at Afowowa and operated for almost four hours. “They made away with laptops and other belongings of our colleagues. We called the police but there was no response. Later, the police said their vehicle was not in good condition. “When they finally arrived, they said the students should lead in facing the gunmen. One of the students was shot in the leg and others were badly injured. That is why we trooped to the street to protest.” The students, who earlier marched to the police station, barricaded the main road linking Abeokuta with Sango-Ota and Lagos. When contacted, the Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said he had not been fully briefed about the cause of the demonstration. “Yes. I am aware of the protest. The command has not been briefed on the causes of the protest.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
