It was all fun and ‘good vibes’ as popular singer, Tiwa Savage, joined her colleague, Reekado Banks, during his performance at the finale of the Future Face Africa model talent search competition, which held on Victoria Island, Lagos, on Sunday, January 30, 2022. Models, Ana Campos (from Angola) and Nziza Ken (from Rwanda) emerged winners in the female and male categories respectively at the event. The finale had 18 contestants who qualified after a selection process involving physical castings in eight African countries, as well as thousands of digital applications from all over the world. Some of the 18 finalists were flown into Lagos for a photo session and runway competition – turning their modelling aspirations into a reality. The two winners won the title of ‘Africa’s Next Future Face’, and got two-year international modelling contracts with a top international modelling agency and $5,000 cash prize. Speaking at the event, the Head of Marketing and Corporate Communications, Ecobank Nigeria, Babajide Sipe, stated the bank’s decision to sponsor the event was in line with its Pan-African vision of developing potentials and talents on the continent.
