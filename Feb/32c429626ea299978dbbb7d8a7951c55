The deceased, 65, was said to be working on his farm when the gunmen accosted him about 10am and shot him. The commissioner described the attack as unprovoked, describing the deceased as his only surviving sibling. He further described his brother’s killing as painful, adding that the state will not surrender to the caprices of evil men marauding as herders. He explained that after his brother was shot, it took a while before he was helped to a nearby hospital but there was no doctor in the facility. The commissioner added that his brother who had sustained severe gun injury was thereafter moved to another hospital where he died a few minutes after. “Herdsman opened fire on him on his farm in Aku in Agatu.
