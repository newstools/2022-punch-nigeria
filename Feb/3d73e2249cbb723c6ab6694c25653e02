The Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate in Ekiti State, Bisi Kolawole, said on Saturday that his administration would prioritise the execution and implementation of youth-based programmes and projects in a bid to redirect the potential of the young ones to productive ventures. Kolawole, who spoke at his Efon Alaaye Ekiti home town while playing host to youths of the party under the aegis of Victory Advocates of Nigeria, stated that he would support the activities of the group, which he said had been doing a great job in promoting harmony in the PDP. “Considering the place of youths, my administration will place emphasis on them with youth-friendly projects, policies and projects. There is a need to ensure better lives for youths. This will stem the tide of crime and add to the growth of the state and country. I encourage the VAN leadership to continue their good work for the party,” he said. Earlier, the VAN National President, Seyi Ajibola, congratulated Kolawole on his emergence as the PDP flag bearer and charged him not to rest until all aggrieved members were reconciled, saying, “Togetherness will make victory sweeter in the June 18 election”. The Ekiti VAN Coordinator, Dr Seun Olowoyeye, who sought the party’s support for the group’s activities, restated members’ commitment to working for the victory of the PDP in the June 18 election for the state to be able to move forward.
