Barcelona have announced that Chief Executive Officer, Ferran Reverter, has resigned from the position for personal and family reasons. In a statement on Tuesday, the club said the resignation will come into effect as soon as a new CEO is appointed. Reverter had been appointed CEO on July 1, 2021, and had served in the club’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan project. Announcing his resignation, he said, “It is now almost a year since I left Germany to return to Barcelona for family reasons and shortly after I accepted the offer that I received from president Joan Laporta to become CEO of the club. These have been passionate months and I thank the president for his trust and, above all, his enthusiasm and capacity for leadership that mean FC Barcelona now has a first class executive team that is able to reposition Barça as a world leader. Personally, I have put in much effort and dedication during these months, but I now wish to focus on the reason why I returned to Barcelona, which is to spend more time on personal and family projects.” His resignation was accepted by the club, saying, “The president and his Board of Directors wish to publicly express their gratitude to Ferran Reverter for his commitment and good work as head of the FC Barcelona executive during this time.” Copyright PUNCH.
