Tension has again enveloped the Mangu Local Government Area of Plateau State following the kidnap of a traditional ruler, Diket Gupiya, by gunmen. Gupiya is the paramount ruler of Pushit District, the country home of the state deputy governor, Sonny Tyoden. Gupiya’s abduction is coming barely two months after Charles Mato, the Sum Pyem, and paramount ruler in the neighbouring Gindiri District was kidnapped and later released after ransom was reportedly paid. Some residents, who confirmed the latest kidnap incident to The PUNCH in Jos on Friday, said that the monarch was abducted at his palace in Pushit on Thursday night. According to them, the district head was in his palace watching television around 9pm when the gunmen attacked his house and whisked him away to an unknown destination. One of the residents, Philip Moses, said, “The unfortunate has befallen us again. Chief Diket Gupiya, our district head in Pushit was kidnapped on Thursday night.” The Police Public Relations Officer in Plateau State, Ubah Ogaba, said that the command was aware of the incident and had deployed some operatives “for a possible rescue of the traditional ruler “.
