Governorship primary of the All Progressives Congress in Osun state did not commence by 8 am on Saturday as scheduled in many wards across the state. In Osogbo, the state capital, traffic was light, as many residents stayed indoors. There was also heavy security presence around Osun APC secretariat. Although many APC members arrived the venue for the exercise early at Oloki ward 9 in Ede, the exercise did not commence at scheduled time. Officials that would conduct the exercise arrived the venue around 9:30am and pasted membership register for the primary. Also, only an agent of the incumbent governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, was present at the polling centre. At Iremo Ward 3, Saint Peters Anglican Primary School, Ile Ife, the excercise did not commence until 10 am due to late arrival of officials. Agent of Osun state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, was present at the polling centre, but agent of Moshood Adeoti, the aspirant backed by the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, and that of Lasun Yusuf, were, however, not present at the venue. Speaking with our correspondent, Special Adviser to the governor on Education, Jamiu Olawumi, said members have conducted themselves peacefully. He also affirmed that Oyetola would win the ward.
