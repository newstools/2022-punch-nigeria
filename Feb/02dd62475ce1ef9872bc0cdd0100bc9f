The Nigeria Governors’ Wives Forum has declared support for the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency in its ongoing campaign against abuse of and trafficking in illicit drugs. Speaking at meeting between the leadership of the forum and the Chairman/chief executive of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohammed Buba Marwa (retd.), at the agency’s National Headquarters in Abuja on Thursday, the women also sought a formidable partnership that would protect the states and Nigeria from the menace. According to a statement issued on Friday by the spokesperson for the NDLEA, Femi Babafemi, the wife of the Ekiti State governor and Chairperson of NGWF, Erelu Bisi Fayemi, led the delegation, which included her counterparts from Kwara, Olufolake Abdulrasaq; Imo, Chioma Uzodinma, and Yobe, Hajiya Hafsat Buni. Welcoming the governors’ wives, Marwa expressed appreciation for the visit, adding that their interest in the country’s drug problem showed their humanity and commitment to support their husbands to engender a better society devoid of drug-induced criminalities. He said, “Let me put it on record that President Muhammadu Buhari is the number one drug fighter in Nigeria today because of all he has done to ensure the country wins the war against abuse and trafficking of illicit drugs. As such, we count on the states, especially the governors’ wives as the pillars and partners through which citizens across the states, local councils and communities are mobilised to reject this ravaging sub-culture.”  Copyright PUNCH.
