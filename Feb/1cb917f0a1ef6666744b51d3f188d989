The Lagos State Government has confirmed the arrest of the real estate developer of the collapsed building in Yaba. According to a statement by Deputy Director, Public Affairs, Lagos State Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development, Mr Mukaila Sanusi, the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr. Idris Salako, was quoted as saying that preliminary findings indicated that the site had been sealed-off twice by the Lagos State Building Control Agency in 2021 for non-compliance with building regulations. The site, he said, was subsequently abandoned. However, Salako said the developer later allegedly broke government seal, sneaked into the site and re-commenced construction without an official authorisation. “The developer in charge of the site has since been arrested and handed over to the RRS Team, while rescue operation is ongoing,” he said.
