Governor of the Central Bank of Nigerians, Godwin Emefiele, has reacted to calls for him to contest for presidency in the 2023 presidential election. According to him, it is the prerogative of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to map out his succession plan. The CBN governor was quoted as speaking when a ‘group of his friends’, tagged ‘Friends of Godwin Emefiele’, visited him to discuss the controversy over his rumoured presidential ambition in 2023. In a statement issued by the group and obtained by The Cable, Emefiele maintained that he would leave his fate firmly in the hands of God. “Only yesterday, as the speculation became widespread, a group of his friends under the aegis of FRIENDS OF GODWIN EMEFIELE met with him to clarify his position,” a statement signed by the group, reads. “Here is what he told us: That he remains focused on his job and will continue supporting the Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government’s economic recovery drive; that in his career trajectory, right from his days as a young banker, he never asked, nor lobbied for a job, he was invited by the Board of Directors to be the Chief Executive Officer/Group Managing Director of Zenith Bank as he was an integral part of the team, led by founder Jim Ovia, that transformed Zenith Bank from a start-up to one of Africa’s largest banks with subsidiaries in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Gambia, South Africa, Dubai, China and the United Kingdom.”
