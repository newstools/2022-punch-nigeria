A presidential aspirant under the banner of the People’s Redemption Party, Abdulfatah Durojaiye, has promised to introduce free education from primary school up to university level if given the mandate to rule the country come 2023. He made the promise while addressing a news conference in Kano on Thursday. He said every Nigerian child should be able to access free education and healthcare because education and healthcare should not be a privilege but a right. According to him, the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo introduced a free education programme which recorded a huge success. “I am one of the beneficiaries of the free education programme of late Chief Obafemi Awolowo which was implemented effectively,” he said. He noted that no country could achieve greatness without giving its citizens quality education to enable them to contribute their quota towards the development of the country. He said as part of the effort to ensure adequate funding for the education sector, he would reduce the cost of governance. “If given the chance to rule the country, we will cut expenses. Why should we have 10 presidential jets at the detriment of education and other sectors of the economy?” he queried. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
