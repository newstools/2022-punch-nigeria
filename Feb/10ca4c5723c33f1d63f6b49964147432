The Nigeria Police Force has transferred Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari; and four others to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency barely four hours after they were declared wanted by the NDLEA. The Spokesman for the drug enforcement agency, Mr. Femi Babafemi, said this in a statement on Monday titled, ‘Wanted DCP Abba Kyari, four others now in our custody – NDLEA’. Others who were brought to the custody of the NDLEA include ACP Sunday Ubua; ASP Bawa James; Inspector Simon Agirgba and Inspector John Nuhu. The statement read in part, “A few hours after he was declared wanted by the NDLEA over his involvement in a 25kg cocaine deal, the Nigerian Police Force has handed over the suspended DCP Abba Kyari, the erstwhile Commander of Intelligence Response Team at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigerian Police Force, to the anti-narcotic agency. “Five of the wanted suspects namely: DCP Abba Kyari; ACP Sunday J. Ubua; ASP Bawa James; Inspector Simon Agirgba and Inspector John Nuhu were driven into the National Headquarters of NDLEA in Abuja at about 5pm on Monday to formally hand them over for interrogation and further investigation. “The agency wishes to assure (members of the public) that no stone will be left unturned to ensure that all suspects already in custody and those that may still be indicted in the course of investigation will face the full weight of the law at the end of the ongoing probe.” Copyright PUNCH.
