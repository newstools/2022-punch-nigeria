The paternity scandal between actress Ronke Odusanya, and the father of her child, Olanrewaju Saheed Aranmolate, popularly known as Jago, has taken a U-turn. Early last year, the social media space was saturated with the sudden breakup of the actress and Jago. The case has been in court over the custody of their daughter. On the 10th of February, 2021, Jago stood before the court and requested a DNA test of their daughter to determine paternity before carrying on with proceedings. Taking a U-turn, Jago took to his Instagram page on Monday to openly apologise for demanding a DNA test concerning the paternity of his daughter, Fifehunmi, whom the actress welcomed in 2019. Jago said, “I’m using this video to clear the air concerning the DNA request I made at the court. “I’m really sorry about that. I want you guys to know that Oluwafifehunmi Aranmolate is my daughter and I love her so much with all my heart.” He captioned the video, “Oluwafifehunmi is my daughter. I love her so much. @ronkeodusanya.” Watch apology video below:  This apology comes barely five weeks after a court declared him wanted for stalling the court proceedings with his absence. Following the court’s order last year, Jago refused to show up, thereby delaying the court process. At this point, the Court couldn’t wait any longer and first issued a bench warrant on October 13, 2021 which he ignored. However, in a court document made available to The PUNCH and dated December 20, 2021, Jago was declared wanted. Ronke, who used to be in a relationship with Fuji maestro Pasuma, had once stated that the father of her child was Jago in an Instagram post in 2019. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
