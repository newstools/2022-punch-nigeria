The Yoruba Stakeholders Summit Group has urged political parties to zone the presidency to the South East and South South for fairness and equity. The group, at a briefing in Lagos on Wednesday, said the south-eastern part of the country had not been privileged to rule Nigeria since independence. The spokesman of Southern Nigeria Frontier, Olufemi Lawson, at the briefing, said politicians asking that zoning should be jettisoned were committing a great disservice to the country. He said, “Over the time, we have been at the forefront of the call for political parties in the country, to have their presidential ticket zoned to the Southern part of the country. We are also of the strong opinion, and conviction, that some part of southern Nigeria, deserves the presidency more than the southwest, for the sake of equity and justice. “We have observed with serious concern, the open and silent demand and declaration by some politicians in the southwest, jostling to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari, come 2023. Not only did we find this insensitive, but it is also self-serving and unjust.” Also, an activist, Mr Oladosu Rasaq, said there are qualified candidates in all regions of the country but for equity and fairness, a south-westerner should not be made candidates by major political parties.
