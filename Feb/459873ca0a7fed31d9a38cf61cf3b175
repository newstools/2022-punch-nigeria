Some gunmen have invaded the Uli Police Station in Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State late on Friday. It was gathered that the hoodlums engaged the policemen on duty in a gun battle. The police repelled the attacks and forced them to abandon one of their operational vehicles, a Lexus 330/salon car. It was said that the hoodlums hurriedly fled the scene to avoid being apprehended when they saw that they were being overpowered by the security operatives. As of the time of filing this report, the level of casualty could not be ascertained as details of the attack were still sketchy. But an unidentified source said the police station and its environs were calm and had been cordoned by security men. The police spokesman, Tochukwu Ikenga, who confirmed the attack, hailed the gallant efforts of the officers on duty.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
