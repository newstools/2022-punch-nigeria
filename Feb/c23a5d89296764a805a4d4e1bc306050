The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has approved the establishment of the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau to ensure compliance with the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation. This approval followed a request by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Pantami, according to a statement on Friday by the minister’s spokesperson, Uwa Suleiman. It said the bureau would focus mainly on data protection and privacy for the country. The statement said, “The successful implementation of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy for a digital Nigeria has significantly increased the adoption of data platforms and accelerated the datafication of our society. This has increased the importance of having an institution that focuses on data protection and privacy. “Furthermore, the issuance of the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation in January 2019, as subsidiary legislation to the National Information Technology Development Agency Act 2007, has increased awareness about the need for data protection and privacy.” It said the bureau would be responsible for consolidating the gains of the NDPR and supporting the process for the development of a primary legislation for data protection and privacy. Buhari also approved the appointment of Dr Vincent Olatunji, who was the director of the eGovernment Development and Regulations Department at NITDA, to serve as the National Commissioner/Chief Executive Officer of the new bureau.
