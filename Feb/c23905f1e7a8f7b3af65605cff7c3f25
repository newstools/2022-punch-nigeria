The Federal Government has said that it would provide hospitals in the country with modern health equipment so as to discourage Nigerians from seeking medical care abroad. The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd) gave this assurance while commissioning some projects at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital on Wednesday. The President, who pledged more commitments to the pursuit of standard healthcare sector in the nation said the issue of ‘medical tourism’ would be shelved as more modern equipment would be supplied to the needs of major federal health institutions across Nigeria. Speaking through the Board Chairman of University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Olorogun Emerhorso, he said, “Mr President’s commitments to an improved healthcare sector remain sacrosanct. This will boost our chances of being treated here over certain medical challenges.” Emerhor praised the Chief Medical Director of the hospital, A.D. Yussuf, for his exemplary leadership styles just as he gave kudos to all the board members and the management of the hospital for turning the health institution into a model for others. Emerhor is leading the 9th Board of the tertiary health institution. Some of the commissioned projects according to the CMD were bankrolled from Internally Generated Revenue and through collaborations with some private bodies. Some of the projects are; the magnificent Eye Centre, Ultra modern Radiology Unit, Procurement Unit and several internally built roads network of the hospital among others. Copyright PUNCH.
