Security operatives barricaded the Peoples Democratic Party rally venue in Calabar on Saturday. As early as 7am, a team of security personnel numbering about 100, including personnel of the Nigerian Army, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps and the police, stormed the Calabar Sports Club venue of the campaign rally. The leader of the team told the party supporters to vacate the venue or face the consequences, but they resisted the order. Hours later, the PDP supporters forced their way into the venue through the emergency gates, while some were seen erecting banners and pasting posters of their various candidates for the by-election and the governorship primary. The state Commissioner of Police, Aminu Alhassan, confirmed that he deployed his men to the venue of the rally to prevent a breakdown of law and order. “I sent the security men to the venue to prevent a breakdown of law and order in the state. Two big parties cannot hold events the same day so that they won’t cause problems,” he stated. The state Working Committee of the PDP had constituted a campaign committee for the Ogoja/Yala Federal Constituency and the Akpabuyo State Assembly by-election billed for Saturday, February 26, 2022.
