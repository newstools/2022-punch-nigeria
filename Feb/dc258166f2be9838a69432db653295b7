American rapper and business mogul, Kanye West has expressed his disinterest in the new wave of digital Non Fungible Tokens. Ye, as he is legally known, took to his Instagram page on Tuesday, where he told off fans advising him to join the digital wealth creation space. In a handwritten letter posted on his page, the Donda rapper said he was focused on “building real products in the real world, real food, real clothes, real shelter.” In the caption of the post, he wrote in all caps, “Stop asking me to do NFT’s. I’m not finna co-sign. For now, I’m not on that wave. I make music and products in the real world.” NFT’s are units of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, and they can be sold and traded with cryptocurrency. These tokens are uniquely identifiable digital assets that are usually photos, videos and audio. This post comes after the Donda rapper recently announced his 11th studio album Donda 2, in February.
