A coalition of youth groups in Nasarawa State under the aegis of the National Youth Council of Nigeria, have endorsed former Governor and Senator representing Nasarawa South Senatorial District at the National Assembly, Umaru Al-Makura, for the position of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress. Speaking at a Press Briefing on Monday in Lafia, State Chairman of NYCN, Jaafar Loko, explained that they were endorsing Al-Makura because of the giant strides he recorded as Governor of the state from 2011 till 2019. While stating that the youth groups were not affiliated with any political party, Loko further stated that youths across the 13 Local Government Areas of the state decided to endorse Al-Makura for the APC Chairmanship position because of his youth empowerment initiatives over the years. He said, “We have decided to take this position because of Al-Makura’s political accomplishments while serving as a youth leader of the National Party of Nigeria and as Governor of Nasarawa State between 2011 and 2019. “When he was Governor, youths took centre stage in the scheme of affairs in the state and he was able to establish the Nasarawa State Youth Empowerment Scheme, which made many of our youths gainfully employed, among other laudable initiatives. “We have no doubt that Senator Al-Makura possesses the right character and qualification to lead the governing All Progressives Congress at the national level. “We are appealing to all APC members and leaders across the country to support his aspiration so that he can emerge as National Chairman of the party.” Copyright PUNCH.
