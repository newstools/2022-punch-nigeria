A 26-year-old Garba Abubakar from Akko Local Government Area of Gombe State has been arrested by operatives of the Nigeria Police Force for allegedly killing his biological mother. Parading the suspect on Thursday, Commissioner of Police, Ishola Babaita, said Garba allegedly murdered his mother because she always warned him against excessive intake of hard drugs. He stated that the suspect’s act was based on indiscriminate use of outlawed substances, adding that investigation had begun. Babaita said, “The suspect strangled his mother as a result she fell down and became unconscious because she normally advise him to stop taking hard drugs. “The victim was rushed to General Hospital Kumo where she was confirmed dead by a medical doctor. “I am advising parents to pay more attention to the care of their children and make sure they are not into hard drug. Sadly this woman was murdered by her own son, that is the effect of drug.” Also paraded was a 53-year-old Adamu Lawal for allegedly raping a 10 years old daughter of his neighbour, who usually takes animals to him for business. “This suspect took advantage of that and forcefully had carnal knowledge of the little girl. The suspect has confessed to the crime, investigation is ongoing and the case will soon be charged to court for prosecution,” Babaita added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
