Cameroon and Egypt went into penalty shoot-out after they ended extra time 0-0 in their Africa Cup of Nations semi-final in Yaounde on Thursday. Michael Ngadeu and Samuel Oum Gouet both hit the woodwork for the host nation at the Olembe Stadium, while Egypt skipper Mohamed Salah was denied by Andre Onana after finding himself through with just the goalkeeper to beat. Egypt coach Carlos Queiroz was shown a red card as the match went into stoppage time. The winners will play Senegal in Sunday’s final. FINAL: Egypt won 3-1 on penalties Copyright PUNCH.
