The sit-at-home home called by the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, on Wednesday, has grounded commercial activities in Onitsha, Nnewi, Oba, and some parts of Awka in Anambra State. Our correspondent, who went round some major cities, observed that banks, motor parks, filling stations, markets and shops were shut. The roads were also empty as vehicles did not ply, even the numerous police and military checkpoints were empty. See photos below:  Photo credit: Ikenna Obianeri Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
