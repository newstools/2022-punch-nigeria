Terrorists on Tuesday killed no fewer than 13 people and abducted several others, including a village head, identified as Alhaji Umar, during attacks on three communities in Bakori and Funtua local government areas of Katsina State. Residents said the attacks started late Monday in Dukawa, where the gunmen looted shops before they moved to Gidan Kanawa, where they killed three residents. The two communities are in Funtua LGA. PUNCH Metro learnt that the hoodlums later moved to Cuga, in Bakori LGA, where they killed 10 residents and abducted the village head, Alhaji Umar. Our correspondent gathered that the terrorists carried out the Cuga operation early Tuesday after leaving Dukawa and Gidan Kanawa. It was learnt that the gang also looted shops and houses in the three communities. The eldest son of the village head, Abdullahi Umar, said, “When they came, they started shooting sporadically to scare people away. I was in my room because it was after 1am. As I tried coming out, I met my father going towards the village centre where the shooting was coming from. The bandits returned with him into the house and looted the house before they left with him and others.” Sources revealed that the slain victims were buried around 12noon on Tuesday. The Katsina State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Gambo Isah, confirmed the incident, but did not give details. “It is true and security operatives are on top of the situation,” he said.
