Former member of the House of Representatives, Abdulmumin Jibrin, has said 14 governors are supporting the presidential ambition of a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. Jibrin, who is the Director-General of the Bola Tinubu Support Group Council, further said that four more governors are in talks to join Tinubu’s train. He added that 26 APC chairmen across the Federation are already in. Jibrin tweeted: “14 Governors in and 4 in talks. 26 State Chairmen in. We will not attack or stop anybody from contesting. “We are exercising our right of choice by promoting Alhaji Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Do same for yours PLS. We will remain gracious and our doors open now and after the victories.” Tinubu had in January declared interest in running for President when he visited President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House in Abuja.
