Senators belonging to the All Progressive Congress Caucus would be holding a meeting today immediately after plenary. The caucus of the Peoples Democratic Party is also billed to hold an emergency meeting immediately after plenary. The Special Assistant (Press) to President of the Senate, Ezrel Tabiowo, made this known in a press statement on Tuesday – without stating the reason for the meetings. The statement said the notice of meeting was conveyed in two separate letters signed by the Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi and the Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe. “The letters were read by the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege who presided over plenary on Tuesday. Abaribe, in the letter disclosed that the PDP caucus meeting which is scheduled to hold at 2pm is between PDP Senators and members of the PDP Board of Trustees,” the statement added. Copyright PUNCH.
