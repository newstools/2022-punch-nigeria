The All Progressives Congress in Benue State says it will not participate in the May 7 local government election in the state. The State Electoral Commission had fixed May 7, 2022, for the LG election. But the State Chairman of the party, Austin Agada, at a press conference held at the party secretariat in Makurdi on Monday, described the forthcoming LG election as a “selection”. Agada said, “On the forthcoming Benue State local government elections, we have consulted widely and come to the painful conclusion that our party will not field candidates for the selection (election) process owing to the dishonest manner the Benue State Independent Electoral Commission has been conducting their affairs. “We can gauge the end from the beginning that the system would not guarantee an iota of fairness to contestants on the APC platform.” Copyright PUNCH.
