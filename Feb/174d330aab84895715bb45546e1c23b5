The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) Has congratulated Lekan Balogun on his appointment as the 42nd Olubadan of Ibadanland. Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, disclosed this in a statement he signed late Monday titled ‘President Buhari congratulates new Olubadan of Ibadanland.’ Buhari’s congratulatory message comes hours after the Oyo state Governor, Seyi Makinde, approved the appointment of Balogun as the 42nd Olubadan of Ibadanland. The approval follows a recommendation by the Olubadan-in-Council, according to a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Taiwo Adisa. According to Adesina, “The President believes that the dedication of High Chief Balogun, the Otun Olubadan of Ibadanland, in diligently serving his people has rightly earned him the new position. “He trusts that the appointment of the 42nd Olubadan of Ibadanland, which validates the noble and cherished tradition of Ibadan people in selecting a traditional leader, will bring peace and prosperity to the land and continued honour to the crown.” Buhari, therefore, extended best wishes of good health, wisdom and longevity to the new Kabiyesi.
