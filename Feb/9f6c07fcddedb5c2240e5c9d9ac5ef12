Portuguese tactician, Jose Peseiro, has said he snubbed the deal to become the coach of the Super Eagles because of “disagreement regarding contractual clauses and financial matters.” He said this in a post on his official Instagram page. Following the sacking of Gernot Rohr as Super Eagles coach, Peseiro was announced as the German tactician’s replacement. He was to take charge of the team after the just-concluded 2021 African Cup of Nations in Cameroon which saw Augustine Eguavoen lead the Super Eagles on interim basis. However, on February 7, the Nigeria Football Federation retained Eguavoen as Interim Technical Adviser while former Nigeria World Cup star and former U-20 Boys’ Head Coach, Emmanuel Amuneke, was appointed as a Chief Coach and an immediate assistant to Eguavoen.
