Actress, Juliet Ibrahim, has warned men to desist from using saliva as a lubricant when having sexual intercourse with women. In a post on her Instagram page, she wrote, “I cannot believe that in 2022, I am (still) arguing with a friend who sees nothing wrong with these things. Her excuse was that, ‘What if it’s a quickie’? Honestly, guys, please take this from me; a woman’s vagina is very delicate. It is her temple. Help her to keep it clean, safe and healthy. Stop using dirty hands and saliva on it. Brush your teeth and tongue before and after oral sex, and cut your nails before any touching. Germs that cause bacteria are bred on such. Girls, please learn these basic hygiene practices and stay clean.” Ibrahim’s ‘hygiene talk’ is coming weeks after singer, Olaitan Abdulrahman, aka Oxlade, was seen using his saliva as lubricant during sexual intercourse with an unidentified lady in a leaked video that went viral on social media. Meanwhile, medical experts have repeatedly warned that the application of saliva on the vagina for lubrication during sexual intercourse could put women at the risk of being infected with sexually transmitted diseases.
