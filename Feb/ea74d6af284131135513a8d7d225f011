The First Lady of Akwa Ibom state, Martha Emmanuel, has removed Ime Ephraim Inyang-yen as coordinator of her pet project, the Family Empowerment and Youths Reorientation Path Initiative. Mrs Inyang-yen was fired barely twenty hours after Governor Udom Emmanuel fired her husband, Ephraim Inyang-yen, from his position as Chief of Staff. Idorenyin Ekanem, wife of Onna local government Chairman, Iniabasi Ekanem, has been appointed Acting Coordinator of FEYReP. The relationship between Emmanuel and his sacked Chief of Staff had become frosty in recent times due to political differences. These differences, it was gathered, started when some prominent stakeholders in Onna, led by the Member of the House of Representatives from the area, Hon Patrick Ifon, last Sunday issued a communique, describing Ephraim as an embarrassment to his community and advised his immediate resignation. Among his “sins” was a viral video in which the former Commissioner for Works was seen telling some chiefs in his community that he was not guilty of the slow pace of work on any road project in the state. The Governor’s wife was left with no other choice than to relieve Mrs Inyang-eyen of her position as Coordinator of FEYReP, a position she has held since the establishment of the pet project by Udom Emmanuel’s wife. According to government house sources, her sack was conveyed to her hours after her husband was relieved of his post as Chief of Staff. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
