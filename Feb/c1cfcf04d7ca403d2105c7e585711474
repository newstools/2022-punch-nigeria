Activist and social commentator, Deji Adeyanju, has said that former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, is an attractive personality to become Nigeria’s President but can’t win the primary of the Peoples Democratic Party. He made the statement in a series of tweets, on Tuesday, via his Twitter handle @adeyanju, “As attractive as Peter Obis presidential ambition is and I absolutely love it so much but he does not stand any chance in a PDP primary or at the general election against the APC. Nigeria is so unfair and Peter Obi knows this. APC does not believe in elections,” he wrote. While Adeyanju took a swipe at the ruling All Progressives Congress, he also stated that the opposition party has a chance against APC. “The only way PDP can win next election is if APC gives their ticket to a Southerner and PDP goes North. PDP should look towards either Tambuwal or Bala, current governors who are young and will be accepted; not one old expired politician that will be going to the hospital always,” he said. “Only the governors in both parties can stop another expired old man who will spend three years in hospital and one year in office from becoming the next president of Nigeria but I do not see them uniting to do so,” he wrote. “Another person that stands a good chance is Bukola Saraki but how can he win a presidential primary in PDP? Politics is deep!” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
