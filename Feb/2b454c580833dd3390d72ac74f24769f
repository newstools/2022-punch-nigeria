He said, “Last night at about 6.45 pm, my brother in law, Abdulhamid Baba-Saliu, Chairman, IPMAN, Edo State and Chairman, Jattu Union, was violently accosted by armed men at the gates of his country home in Jattu, Etsako West LGA, Edo State. “He lives between Benin, Abuja and Jattu where runs his chain of petrol stations, Baba Petroleum. He was at home over the week for the third-day prayer for his uncle who died last week. “One of his drivers was instantly shot and killed; and the other driver, including his personal security details, was grievously injured in the attack. My brother-in-law was taken away by the kidnappers. No contact, or random demand, has been made as yet. “These are difficult and trying times for us. While we continue to pray for his safe return, I appeal to his abductors and keepers to release him unharmed to his family and community, Jattu, Uzairue, that he has given much love as a father and respected community leader.” When contacted, the Edo State Police Command’s spokesperson, Bello Kontongs, confirmed the incident.
