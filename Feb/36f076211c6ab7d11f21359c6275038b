EMMANUEL Dennis will become the third Super Eagles player to score 10 goals or more in his first season in the English Premier League if he finds the back of the net for Watford in their clash against Crystal Palace on Wednesday (today), PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The Nigerian ended his five-game goals drought, heading in the match winner for the Hornets in the 1-0 win over Aston Villa last Saturday, to hand Roy Hodgson his first win in charge. The duo Osaze Odemwingie and Yakubu Aiyegbeni scored 10 or more goals in their debut season in the EPL for their respective EPL teams in the past. Odemwingie joined West Brom from Locomotive Moscow during the 2010/11 season and scored 15 goals in 32 games for the Baggies. Aiyegbeni also scored 16 goals in 37 games in his debut season during the 2003/2004 season. The Hornets, who are seeking their sixth win of the season, are 18th in the EPL standings with 18 points from 24 games. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
