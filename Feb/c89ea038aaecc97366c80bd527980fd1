A learning platform, Gradely, and an educational institution, Ehizua Hub, Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos have said its vision is to improve the learning outcomes of 20 million students by 2030. A statement by the Gradely said the ‘Top Graders Remedial School’ located in Ajah, Lagos would promote high-quality personalised learning across Africa for as low as N500 per day. Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Gradely, Boye Oshinaga, explained that The Remedial School was a room occupied with 20 internet-enabled computers where children can easily access the Gradely app every day at just N500. Oshinaga said it was specifically for children who had learning difficulties that needed to be remedied as they prepare for entrance exams such as SSCE, Post UTME, and Common Entrance. “It is equally for children that attend low-cost private schools or are homeschooled due to financial struggles and therefore don’t have proper access to quality education. “Gradely is bringing digital learning closer to people’s neighborhoods with our Remedial School. By ensuring that internet access is not an issue, we can impact students who will normally be excluded from digital learning revolution. It is also low-cost and provides a viable alternative to expensive tutorial centres. It is adaptive and personalised, meaning more efficiently in improving weak subject areas.” “We are partnering with innovators, educators, and some educational institutions like Ehizua hub to do it. Our plan is that one school can cater to 100 students and we can do up to 10 per Local Government Areas.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
