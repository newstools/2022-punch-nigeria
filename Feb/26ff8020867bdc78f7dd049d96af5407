Multiple award-winning rapper, Nicki Minaj, has written an open letter to men concerning women’s pleasures. The mother-of-one in a Twitter post on Saturday noted that women do not apply make-up, dress, or do their hair because of men. She also stated that men engage in sexual activities for their own pleasure and not for women’s. The rapper then told men to allow women take care of their personal grooming even as men focus on sexual pleasure. Nicki tweeted, “Dear men, women don’t dress for you, do makeup for you or do their hair for you. “Just like most of you all only f**k for yourselves and not the woman’s pleasure. “This is all for us. This ain’t about you. Now go. Thanks for coming.” See post below:  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
