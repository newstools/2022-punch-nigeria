Traders under the aegis of Onitsha Drug Market Traders, Anambra State, have issued the state governor, Willie Obiano, a 14-day ultimatum to conduct elections in the market before the inauguration of the governor-elect, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo. The traders protested at the state Ministry of Trade, Commerce, Market and Wealth Creation complex, Awka, on Tuesday. The group’s spokesman, Mr Leo Ezievuo, said the market was yearning for new leadership. Ezievuo described those against the conduct of elections in the market as saboteurs and miscreants, sponsored to disrupt the peaceful atmosphere in the market. He said the non-conduct of election created room for the installation of a caretaker committee whose tenure had long expired. He said, “We are tired of caretaker committee leadership. We want to elect our leaders by ourselves. People who are protesting against the election are unknown to the market union and entire traders. They are hired thugs. “We campaigned for the incoming governor of the state, Prof. Charles Soludo, when he visited Bridge-Head Market during the election campaign which he emerged winner with our votes in support. “Now, the coast is clear, the same people who absconded from the market during Soludo’s visit/ campaign tour wanted to reap from where they did not sow by blackmailing everybody in order to tag themselves best and stop the conduct of the long-awaited leadership election in the market.” The ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Ike Chinedu, who spoke on behalf of the Commissioner, Mr Uche Okafor, promised to ensure that election is conducted soon.
