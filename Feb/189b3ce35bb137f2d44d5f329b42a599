The Chairman of Chidicon Medical Research Centre, Owerri, Imo State, Prof. Philip Njemanze has warned against the indiscriminate use of contraceptives as a means of population control. Njemanze, said this in an interview with our correspondent on Tuesday. He said instead of the use of contraceptives, natural family planning should be adopted in schools and public establishments. Njemanze, a neurologist said that the Population Policy was ill-conceived to implement population control with contraceptives, adding that “estrogen derivatives are the main active ingredients that cause cancer, blood clots leading to heart attacks, strokes and deep venous thrombosis. “The MMR in Nigeria is 814 per 100,000 live births. This rate could quadruple with the mass use of contraception in Nigeria. The global MMR was 152 deaths per 100,000 live births much lower than in Nigeria.” He added, “This population policy is the greatest threat to the health of Nigerian women. This could be prevented by implementing Natural Family Planning which is more effective and has no debilitating health effects.” On the overall population control policy, Njemanze, said the strategy was not evidence-based. “Outright, the population reduction is counter-productive to economic development. Population is the main engine driving economic growth worldwide. The most important index is population density,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
