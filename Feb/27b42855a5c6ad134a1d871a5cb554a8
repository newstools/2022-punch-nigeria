A model, beauty therapist, entrepreneur and environmental activist, Favour Philip, is undoubtedly a beautiful woman. It is thus not surprising that many men would give almost anything to have her in their lives. In an interview with Saturday Beats, Philip revealed how a married man once offered her $20,000 and a trip to Maldives to become his third wife. Recounting the experience, she said, “He is a wealthy businessman and I met him on an airplane from Abuja to Lagos. After a short talk with him, we exchanged numbers and what happened afterwards has left me in amazement till today. The man, who is presumed to be very busy, usually called me almost every hour of the day. I did all I could to avoid him until one day, he requested that we should meet at a popular restaurant in Lagos. After the meal, he made a proposition that left me shocked and a bit tempted, to be honest. “He offered to give me a whopping $20,000 (approximately N10m) and a trip to Maldives for my birthday if I agreed to marry him and be his third wife. It was a juicy offer that many ladies would gladly jump at but I stood my ground and did not give in. I can never agree to be anyone’s second wife, talk more of being the third. I was actually under pressure from some friends to accept the offer but I did not budge.” Encouraging women not to be desperate in such situations, she said, “I believe there is nothing a man can give a woman that she cannot provide for herself. We (women) have a lot of potentials and we only need to be hardworking and we will attain whatever heights we set our eyes to. An independent woman is a strong pillar in society.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
