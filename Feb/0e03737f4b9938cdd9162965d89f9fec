Talent manager, Tunji ‘Teebillz’ Balogun, has revealed that he appreciated the mothers of his kids because they make fatherhood an amazing experience for him. Teebillz, who was married to Nigerian singer Tiwa Savage, took to his Instagram page on Sunday to decree God’s blessings upon the women associated with him through children. He shared a screenshot of Tiwa’s son, Jamil Balogun, on a video with his latest child, Zayn. In the caption, the talent manager wrote, “I appreciate the mothers of my kids! May God continue to bless you all for making fatherhood an amazing experience for me. Blessings.” This comes a month after the talent manager revealed that he has welcomed another son named Zayn. It was reported that in his first marriage to Kenea Udoh, Teebillz had two children and his union with Tiwa Savage had produced Jamil. Though the number of children by the talent manager is not certain, Teebillz had last year appreciated his lover for taking care of his five children named Khalil, Gaetano, Jamil, Bisi, and Ona.
