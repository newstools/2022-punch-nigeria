An Engineer Olanrewaju Rosiji, has developed an application to register the details of all rural roads in the country. The application, called ‘rural roads enumerators navigator,’ was designed to help the federal project management unit operators of the Rural Access And Agricultural Marketing Project to “real time gather the origins, features, latitude and longitude of Rural roads in the country and cloud them for use in planning, for aggregate development,” Rosiji said in a statement. RAAMP is a multilateral funded project between the Federal Government (on behalf of participating states), the World Bank and the French Development Agency designed to ensure that rural roads and markets are rehabilitated and modernised, respectively. Making a presentation of the geographic information system tool to members of the World Bank and FPMU at a two-day strategic implementation review meeting for Southern RAAMP States in Abeokuta, at the weekend, Rosiji said that “tactical deployment of the tool will curtail banditry with enough political will.” The Technical Team Lead, World Bank, Kabir Roushan, said the tool “will intelligently guide road enumerators to the origin of all rural roads under RAAMP to conduct accurate, reliable and complete enumeration on Nigerian roads.” The Infrastructure Team Lead, Bukar Abdulazziz, said his understanding of the tool showed that it would ease enumeration exercise, ensure that each road in a local government is captured under Nigeria’s Rural Transport Infrastructure Management System for the purpose of ensuring a secured data transmission.
