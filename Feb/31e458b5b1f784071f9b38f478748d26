MFM will tackle Katsina United in the Nigeria Professional Football League in Lagos on match-day 13 in a battle for survival. Both sides have been struggling, with the Olukoya Boys, who occupy bottom place, without a win in their last six games in the league, while the 17th place Changi Boys have witnessed a turnaround in their recent form, winning two of their last three games. While MFM have won just two out of 12 matches this season, Katsina on their part have won four games but have suffered seven defeats. MFM goalkeeper Jerry Isaac is hopeful of a reversal of fortunes, starting with the clash against Katsina. “It’s still very possible to ensure that we stay in the topflight and I can tell you now that we are stronger mentally and everything has changed, compared to what it was weeks back,” Isaac, told PUNCH Sports Extra. “Our target against Katsina United is to get the three points and there is no doubt about that, I may sound overconfident but that’s the truth. We will win the game with plenty of goals. “We want to work together as a family so that we can get what we want because we are not happy with our current position and we are confident that things will turn around for good very soon.”  All rights reserved.
