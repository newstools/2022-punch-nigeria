A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Tuesday granted the application of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for the final forfeiture of $899,600 (N500m) linked to a former Secretary to the Bauchi State Government, Ibrahim  Dandija. A Federal High Court had in 2019 ordered an interim forfeiture of the said sum following an ex parte application filed by the agency for its seizure. The commission’s Head, Media and Publicity, Wilson Uwujaren, disclosed this in a statement titled, “Court orders final forfeiture of N500m linked to ex-Bauchi SSG.” It read, “The court held that the prosecution had placed sufficient evidence that the said money was proceeds of crime and should be forfeited to the Federal Government of Nigeria as demanded by the Money Laundering Prohibition Act of 2011 as amended in 2012. “Justice Folashade Giwa Ogunbanjo of the Federal High Court, Abuja had on December 4, 2019, ordered the interim forfeiture of the said sum after EFCC, through her counsel, Ekele Iheanacho, filed an ex parte application for its seizure, upon recovery from an apartment at Sigma Apartment, 1 Embu Street, off Aminu Kano Crescent, Wuse 2, Abuja, being suspected proceeds of illegal activities.” Copyright PUNCH.
