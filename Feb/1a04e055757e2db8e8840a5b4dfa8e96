Animal rights group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, has condemned Bayern Munich player, Thomas Muller, and his wife, Lisa, for selling horse semen. The Bundesliga forward and his dressage champion wife were accused of selling the frozen semen of the horses on his farm for €200, per poop, which amounted to N93,923.78, Daily Star UK reported on Sunday. PETA debunked the claim that one of Muller’s horses injured itself in the hoof area recently during the breeding season. The organisation claimed that they had used the animal for “unnatural sexual acts”. PETA spokesman, Jana Hoger said, “It is awful that self-styled horse lovers force the animals in their care into unnatural sex acts in order to make the maximum profit from them. “The injuries that D’Avie suffered under Lisa and Thomas Muller’s supervision were avoidable and unnecessary.” Recently, Animal Rights sympathisers have raised concern over the treatment of animals. English football coach, Chris Kirkland, recently called out French footballer, Kurt Zouma, for abusing his cat. He compared Zouma’s act to racism. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
