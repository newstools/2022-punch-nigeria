It was another tragedy for the dead as a mysterious fire burnt some corpses kept in the morgue at the Agagbe community in Gwer West Local Government Area of Benue State. The incident occurred at about 5:00 pm on Friday at the mortuary said to belong to St. Francis Xavier Parish Agagbe. A local told our correspondent that some of the corpses deposited at the morgue were burnt beyond recognition. “We can not ascertain the number of corpses that were in the morgue so also the cause of the fire is yet unknown, we just discovered that the morgue went up in flames on Friday evening,” the local said. The State Police Command spokesperson, SP Catherine Anene, confirmed the incident at the morgue, stating that six corpses were burnt. “It is true, the DPO is on it, the information we received is that the fire started somewhere and only extended to the morgue. Six corpses were burnt, investigation is ongoing,” Anene said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
