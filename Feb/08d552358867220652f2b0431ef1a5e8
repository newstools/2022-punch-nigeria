The Vice Chancellor of Federal University, Oye Ekiti, Prof. Abayomi Fasina, has said the university is working round the clock to achieve his administration’s vision of ensuring food security in Ekiti State from the yield of its commercial farm. Fasina said the university had procured tractors, ploughing and harrowing machines as well other modern farm implements to achieve the goal of feeding Ekiti State. He spoke on Tuesday at a press conference at Oye Ekiti to herald activities lined up for first year of his appointment. He frowned on the activities of some individuals parading themselves as landowners and slowing down development in the institution. He said that FUOYE had secured full accreditation for the 48 courses being offered by the institution and thus instilled confidence and patronage for admission in the university. According to him, through hard work, timely promotion and brilliant scouting, the university has 74 professors and 51 associate professors, contributing to scholarship and giving it good ranking globally. Fasina said that his administration had built 12 300-seater lecture theatres for improved teaching and learning, saying, “My target is to build 10 of these structures annually to give over 27,000 students the deserved comfort.” He said, “We are going to give the Faculty of Agriculture a marching order to start mass production of food crops, and our target is to spend part of the proposed N400m grant from the Central Bank of Nigeria on farming. “The faculty has all the implements, and we expect that they can start this by feeding the university community and move up to feed the whole of Ekiti.” Copyright PUNCH.
