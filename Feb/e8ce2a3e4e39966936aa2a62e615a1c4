Stakeholders of the Akwa Ibom State chapter of the All Progressives Congress have called on the National Secretary of the party’s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Dr John Akpanudoedehe, to contest the governorship election in the state in 2023. This is according to a communiqué issued on Thursday in Abuja by the stakeholders after a meeting comprising 40 elder statesmen who expressed their support for the National Secretary. The communiqué signed by a leading stakeholder, Atuekong Etiebet, and a former governorship candidate in 2015, Samuel Akpan, said the meeting was meant to summon Akpanudoedehe to join the governorship race because of his track record in public service, political party administration, vast experience in business, local government administration and exposure to national politics as a minister of the Federal Republic. The stakeholders added that his “capacity to interact with the grassroots put him forward as one with the greatest potential that can win the election for the party in Akwa Ibom State.” It read, “After exhaustive deliberation, the motion was overwhelmingly passed with a notation for the resolution taken by a credible collection of Akwa Ibom APC stakeholders.” The stakeholders also commended the APC National Chairman, CECPC, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe state for “the effective manner he has piloted the affairs of the party and fulfilled the core mandate of its assignment which is to convene the national convention now scheduled to hold on February 26, 2022.” Copyright PUNCH.
