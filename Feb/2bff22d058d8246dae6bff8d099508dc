The Awujako of Ijako-Orile, Yewa-North Local Government Area of Ogun State, Oba Mathew Ewedairo, has appealed to the state governor, Dapo Abiodun, to fix the poor Iboro–Ijako–Aga Olowo road in the area council. The monarch also demanded compensation on behalf of the community from the Dangote Group of Company for being a host to its cement factory in the state. Oba Ewedairo stated this at the celebration of his first year on the throne. He said, “Ijako-Orile is the principal host community to Dangote Cement Plc; the land on which Dangote is sighted is Adapele–Ijako (one of our homestead). “We have been trying to forget some horrible past treatments Ijako-Orile has suffered when we are supposed to be in affluence. We implore all concerned to have a rethink and start to treat Ijako accordingly in the interest of fairness, justice, and fear of God. “I implore our dear Governor to help include the road that connects Yewa North and Ewekoro Local Governments; that is Iboro–Ijako–Aga Olowo Road. “The economic impact of the road is enormous and particularly to serve as the major buffer road to the fast congesting Dangote route of Igbogila–Ibeshe– Itori Road.” The monarch however lauded the Olu and Paramount ruler of Ilaro, Oba Kehinde Olugbenle, for his wise counsel which he said encouraged him to intensify more efforts on reconciliation.
