The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the primary election of Murtala Karshi as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress for the Abuja Municipal Area Council. The PUNCH had reported that two candidates, Sulaimon Gwagwa and Muritala Karshi, were laying claim to the chairmanship ticket of the party in the Area council. The two candidates have been campaigning in different parts of FCT. The ruling is coming 48 hours to the local government election slated to be held on Saturday. In a unanimous judgement of a five-member panel of the Supreme Court on Thursday, Helen Ogunwumiju, who prepared the lead decision, held that the Court of Appeal was wrong to have overturned the judgement of the trial court which affirmed Karshi’s candidacy of the APC. In the judgement, which was read by Centus Nweze, the Supreme Court upheld Mr Karshi’s candidacy for the Saturday council elections in the FCT. “The 1st appellant (Mr Karshi) whose name was submitted by the 2nd appellant (APC) to the 2nd respondent (INEC) for the general election of chairman Abuja Municipal Area Council, remains the valid candidate for the election.” Also, the Supreme Court imposed a N5 million fine on Gwagwa in favour of Karshi and the APC.
