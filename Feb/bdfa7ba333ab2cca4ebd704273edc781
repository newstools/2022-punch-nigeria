A member of the Zamfara State House of Assembly representing Zamfara East constituency, Salihu Zurmi, has cried out over what he called the persistent attacks, intimidation as well as threats to his life because he refused to defect to the All Progressives Congress with Governor Bello Matawalle. Zurmi, who is the only lawmaker that refused to decamp to the APC, said he has been receiving threats to his life from unknown persons. He maintained that the harassment reached a head when he refused to support the impeachment moves against the state Deputy Governor, Mahdi Gusau. Zurmi said, “They have been harassing and intimidating me because I refused to support the impeachment of the Deputy Governor. They have been trying to silence me since the impeachment process started. “That is why I decided to leave the state and come to Abuja because I Know that the worse could happen if I remain in Zamfara”. The lawmaker expressed displeasure over the alleged persistent attacks and intimidation of the opposition by Mattawale’s administration, lamenting that this does not augur well for the state. “Believe me, this will not augur well for the state which is facing security challenges,” he noted. Zurmi said he would never support the impeachment process against the deputy governor, whom he described as a complete gentleman. He also maintained that he would remain in the PDP no matter what it would cost him, calling on the governor to allow freedom of association in the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
