GLASGOW Rangers manager Giovanni van Bronckhorst has heaped plaudits on defender Calvin Bassey following his impressive display for the Scottish champions in the wake of their 6-4 aggregate Europa League win over German giants Borussia Dortmund. Bronckhorst praised the Nigerian for his versatility and willingness to learn and believes the Nigerian can reach the top. The Eagles invitee has played in a variety of positions this season including central defender, left-back and wing-back. With the Gers trailing Dortmund in Thursday’s second leg fixture, the Dutchman made a tactical change at halftime, bringing on Leon Balogun to replace Borna Barisic and pushing Bassey to the left wing-back position. The decision paid off with the 21-year-old defender providing the assist for Rangers’ equaliser in the 57th minute when his cross was volleyed home by James Tavernier. “He’s (Bassey) very dynamic, he’s very versatile because he can play as a center back, it’s not his natural position but I think his development in that position is very good, “Van Bronckhorst said ahead of “He can play at left back, he’s strong, he’s fast. The most important thing he wants to learn, he wants to be better, every training session he comes with a lot of questions. “I think we have not seen the best of him, he can still improve and become better but he’s giving me a lot of options to play him and his contribution is amazing. “Today he started as a center back, he switched to the wing-back position, my left wing-back got the cross in and my right wing-back scored the goal. It’s amazing how they did it.” Bassey is now three games away from reaching a 50-game milestone for Glasgow Rangers.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
