Some victims of Boko Haram bomb blasts in the Federal Capital Territory have accused the Federal Government of abandoning them. They said they only received help from the government while in the hospital during the early stage of the incidents. The Chairman, Bomb Blast Victims Association of Nigeria, Kayode Olatunji, who spoke on their behalf, said this at an event organised by a Non-Governmental Organisation, Speak Out, Stand Out to commemorate the incidents on Friday. Olatunji said that although previous administrations made effort to support the victims, they did not get enough support as expected. “Every member of the BVAN will tell you like it was the case with me, that they only got help for a while at the hospitals. “I was treated with assistance from the government at the University Teaching Hospital in Gwagwalada, Abuja, for four months and two weeks, after which I was made to fully continue the treatment since help no longer came from government,” he said. The chairman also urged the government to pay attention to rehabilitation and detraumatising the victims as it had been doing for the repentant terrorists. According to him, neither him nor any member of BVAN ever got a dime or have been compensated or rehabilitated. “It appears that the victims are the biggest losers and the insurgents are the winners but victims should not be pushed to violence,” Olatunji said He urged the government to probe the utilisation of the victims’ support funds
