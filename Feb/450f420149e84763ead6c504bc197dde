The agriculture sector recorded improved performance in 2021, when compared to the previous year, data from the National Bureau of Statistics have shown. The NBS said the sector output grew by N3.89tn from N37.22tn in 2020 to N41.12tn last year. This growth is despite worsening insecurity in food-producing states in the country last year, fuelled by the violent activities of bandits, herdsmen and kidnappers. At least 216 farmers were killed while 136 were kidnapped last year, according to the Nigeria Security Tracker, a project of the Council on Foreign Relations’ Africa, and media reports. The NBS data, however, showed that all the subsectors that make up the agriculture sector recorded improved performance last year. Crop production output rose to N36.35tn in 2021 from N33.17tn; livestock saw a growth of N240bn from N2.12tn to N2.25tn; forestry rose to N296.9bn from N284.8bn while fishing output surged to N2.23tn from N1.66tn. A breakdown of the total output recorded in 2021 showed that N9.21tn was recorded in Q1, N9.32tn in Q2, N12.61tn in Q3 and N12.59tn in Q4. The N9.2tn recorded in Q1 comprises N7.21tn output from crop production, N613bn from livestock, N73bn from forestry and N663bn from fishing. In Q2, crop production contributed N7.55tn to total output; livestock, N508bn; forestry, N75bn; and fishing, N519bn. The contribution of crop production to quarterly output grew to N10.96tn in Q3 while livestock, forestry and fishing contributed N517bn, N70bn and N437bn respectively. In Q4, the total output of N12.59bn was made up of N10.61tn from the crop production subsector, N609bn from livestock, N77bn from forestry and N608bn from fishery. Copyright PUNCH.
