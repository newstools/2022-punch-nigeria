As the Russia-Ukraine war enters its third day, 27 nations, including the United States and United Kingdom, have pledged to send weapons, medical supplies, and other military aid to the Ukrainian forces, Sky News reports. “The assistance includes lethal aid, like ammunition, anti-tank weapons and anti-air weapons, and non-lethal aid such as medical supplies,” the report says. This followed a virtual ‘donor conference’ of military aid organised by the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, on Friday evening, where the 25 nations, who were on the call, pledged their support. Two other nations, who could not attend the conference, sent in their pledges to support, on Saturday. Earlier, the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, had said that their partners were sending weapons to support the Ukrainian forces, stressing that “The anti-war coalition is working!” Sky News reported that the Ukrainian forces have so far put up a strong resistance against the invading troops, even though it is uncertain how long the defence could hold out. Meanwhile, Russia’s military claimed to have taken over Melitopol, a city in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, but UK armed forces minister, James Heappey, said it is “still in Ukrainian hands,” Sky news reports.
