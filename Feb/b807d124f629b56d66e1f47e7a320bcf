Following political and communal crises in Gombe State, Convener of Dialogue and Conflict Mediation, Dahiru Abubakar, has urged youths not to allow themselves to be used by politicians. Abubakar made this disclosure at a day lecture organised by Munzaifad Care Foundation in collaboration with Cardinal John Onaiyekan Foundation, where he admonished them to eschew violence and embrace peace. Abubakar said, “The top-class people usually are the ones that cause this type of violence. They will not go and they will not send their children; most of their children are not staying here as some of them are outside the country, they will just organise those from the lower class and start giving them drugs to start harassing other people. If you will not use your children then you must stop destroying other people’s children. “Politics is a game of number, come out and get your own number, it is not a game of violence.” Also, Abdullahi Hussaini said youths were the most vulnerable, noting that a lot was needed to ensure they were protected. Hussaini said the era of using motorcycles for empowerment to hoodwink them into nefarious activities should be over. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
