SUPER EAGLES midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, says he is not carried away by the praises heaped on him after a fine performance st the ongoing AFCON in Cameroon. Ndidi played in all four games for the Eagles at the tournament, as they crashed out in the Round of 16 to Tunisia, after winning all their three group games against Egypt, Sudan and Guinea Bissau. The 24-year-old’s dream of winning the AFCON was shattered by a long-range Youssef Msakni strike. “I don’t really pay attention to the recognition. I just come out to play football and enjoy myself. I try to help the team always,” he said. Ndidi has 11 appearances at the AFCON tournament since his debut against Burundi at the 2019 edition in Egypt, where the Eagles finished third after a 1-0 win over Tunisia. The midfielder is expected to rejoin his Leicester City teammates on Thursday (today) ahead of their fourth-round FA Cup clash away at Nottingham Forest. The Foxes are currently 10th in the EPL standings with 26 points from 20 games played.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
