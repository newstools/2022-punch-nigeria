Social activist, Aisha Yesufu, has advised politicians seeking elective positions and political appointments into various offices to bury their ambitions if they despise public criticism. She said the belief that public office holders are beyond criticism from the electorate is out of sync with democratic tenets. Yesufu who took to her verified Twitter handle, @AishaYesufu, on Wednesday to offer the advice, noted that every political office holder accepted to be accountable the day they declared interest for the office. According to her, “If you cannot take the heat, stay out of the kitchen. Public service is not for the faint-hearted. If there is no truth in the issue, it wouldn’t stick. Focus on transparency and accountability.” Yesufu tweeted, “I am criticised now and the day I put myself forth for public office, the criticism will more than triple and nobody owes me praises. I owe everyone accountability and transparency and will endure all criticism otherwise I stay off public office “Every person running for office should be criticised. The arrogance of thinking some people are beyond criticism needs to be quashed. Nobody is doing anyone a favour by running for office! “You do not owe any public office holder or one aspiring to be one “constructive” criticism. If they cannot bear the criticism, they should not vie to be in public office.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
