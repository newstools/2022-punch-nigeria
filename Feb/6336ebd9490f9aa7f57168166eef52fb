The University of Benin and Bionomics Nigeria Limited on Tuesday signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the provision of 1,000 Closed Circuit Television cameras in the school’s main campus in Ugbowu and the Ekhuaun Campus. The agreement will run for 15 years and will also see the firm build a facility in the school to monitor the footages from the cameras for security purposes. The company will maintain the CCTV and will be given the sole right for advertising on the school campuses for the duration of the agreement. Speaking at the event, the university’s Vice Chancellor, Prof Lilian Salami, who described the event as historic, said the CCTV would help to curb vices in the school, noting that the agreement would be a win-win situation for the school and the company. She said, “This MOU is an agreement I am excited about. The 1,000 CCTV will enhance security on the campus and curb crime and vices. The world is dynamic and the CCTV will help us monitor activities on campus. “The advertisement is good for Bionomics because the student population presents a good market. For UNIBEN, we will also benefit the proceeds from the adverts as stipulated in the MoU. History is being made here today and I hope that when the agreement comes to fruition, we will begin to reap the benefits. The VC commended the company for finding the school worthy of the arrangement, noting that all hands would be on deck to ensure it success. The Chief Executive Officer of Bionomics, Onyedika Ugochukwu, said that survey for the job would begin immediately to ensure that 100 CCTV are in operation within six months. Copyright PUNCH.
