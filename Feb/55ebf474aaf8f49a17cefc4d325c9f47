Nollywood actress, Nkechi Blessing Sunday, on Wednesday gifted her sister, Jennifer, a new car. Sharing photos of her sister with the car, Nkechi noted that Jennifer took care of the family when she travelled, hence she deserved everything. Though the actress noted that she doesn’t own a car, she felt her sister deserved one because family comes first for her. “@jennifer_ijeomasunday held the family business down while I travelled around. She deserves everything and more,” Nkechi wrote. She added, “Enjoy your ride sis. Even though I don’t have a car, it’s always family first for me.” Three weeks ago, Nkechi had revealed that she sold her Range Rover in 2021 to enable her to complete her house project. The light-skinned actress had stated that she was happy about making the decision, which she described as the best one she made in 2021. She wrote, “The best decision I made in 2021 was selling my Range Rover to complete this beauty behind me. Thank God for the space bus I bought for my mum. Landlady would have been trekking by now.” The actress had announced the completion of her house in December 2021. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
