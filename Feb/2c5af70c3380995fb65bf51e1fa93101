A Federal High Court in Abuja on Wednesday ordered the interim forfeiture of about 10 properties and funds in banks allegedly owned by a former governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari. Justice Obiora Egwuatu gave the order while ruling in an ex-parte application by lawyer to the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other-Related offences Commission, Osuobeni Ekoi Akponimisingha. Justice Egwuatu said the interim order granted would last for 60 days to enable the ICPC conclude its investigation, following which the commission could apply for final forfeiture. The judge ordered the ICPC to publicise the order for any person or persons with interest in the affected properties to show cause within 14 days why they should not be permanently forfeited to the Federal Government. Some of the properties, according to the ICPC, are in Maryland (USA), Abuja, Kaduna, among others. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
