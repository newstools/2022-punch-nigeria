THE Oyo State Government on Saturday declared that it had not altered its policy on freedom of religion, urging residents of the state to discountenance recent attempts to misinterpret a statement from the Office of the Special Assistant on Islamic Affairs on the wearing of hijabs. It added that the government of Governor ‘Seyi Makinde would not tamper with the codes that had guaranteed religious freedom and harmony in the state, stating that the status quo regarding the matter as contained in a circular dated October 27, 2013, remains. This was said in a statement issued by Special Assistant to the Governor of Islamic Affairs, AbduRasheed AbdAzeez. The statement partly read, “The attention of the government of Oyo State has been drawn to the series of misleading headlines ascribed to a statement issued in commemoration of this year’s World Hijab Day observed on February 1, 2022. “The statement in question, issued from the office of the Special Assistant to the governor on Islamic Affairs, intended to emphasise the essence of religious harmony, tolerance and freedom, which have remained the bedrock of the peaceful co-existence we all enjoy in Oyo State. “For the avoidance of doubt, the government of Engineer ‘Seyi Makinde will not tamper with the codes that have guaranteed religious freedom and harmony in our dear state over time and that is why it will continue to keep faith with the existing circular endorsed by the state government as far back as 2013.” Copyright PUNCH.
