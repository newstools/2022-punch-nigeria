The Bauchi State House of Assembly has lamented that the Government Secondary School in Baba Takko has turned into a criminal hideout and a centre for illicit drug consumption. The Assembly called on the state government to convert the school to a maternity centre, which would be more beneficial to the residents of the area. The Deputy Speaker of the House, Danlami Kawule, who represents the Zungur/Galambi Constituency, spoke during plenary under matters of urgent public importance, and drew the attention of the House to the ugly development. He explained that the situation, if left unchecked, would pose a serious security threat to the residents of the community and the state in general. Kawule appealed to the House to communicate to the relevant government agencies that the school should be converted into a maternity centre or any facility that would be of help to the community, instead of having the school shut. In his contribution, the Majority Leader, Tijjani Aliyu, said the issue of security needed to be given all the necessary attention that it required. He suggested that the House Committee on Security should liaise with relevant security and government organs so that the true picture of the situation would be ascertained, pointing out that they should come up with solutions to enable the House take appropriate decisions. The Speaker, Abubakar Suleiman, mandated the House Committee on Security to liaise with the office of the Secretary to the State Government to find out about the situation, which he said was very serious and worrisome. The Government Secondary School in Baba Takko was closed down during the Isa Yuguda administration following a crisis that happened there.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
