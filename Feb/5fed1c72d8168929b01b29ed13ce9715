GUNMEN have reportedly attacked communities in Kagoro and its environs in the Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna, killing 11 residents while scores were injured. It was gathered that the attack happened on Thursday evening where six residents were killed on the spot. Our correspondent gathered that five more bodies were found and recovered on Friday morning. A source further told our correspondent that several residents were injured during the attack. He said, “Apart from those that have been confirmed killed by the attackers, l cannot give you the number of those injured because people took their injured relatives to the hospital for treatment. It was a massive destruction visited on the people by the gunmen.” According to him, normalcy has returned to the town as residents are going about their normal businesses. This was as he said security operatives were patrolling the town to forestall further breakdown of law and order in the ancient town. There were no official reactions or confirmation either from the state government or the police.
