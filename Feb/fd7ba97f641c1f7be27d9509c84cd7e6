The Peoples Democratic Party and the opposition All Progressives Congress in Delta State, on Monday, engaged in a war of words over another N12bn loan approved by the state House of Assembly. The House of Assembly had recently approved the loan request by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa. The Director of Publicity of the APC in the state, Dr Omene Odafe, said Delta was arguably the last state in Nigeria that needed to borrow or should be going for any loan. He said, “Once again, the cash-and-carry Peoples Democratic Party administration of Dr Ifeanyi Okowa has connived with the Delta State House of Assembly to obtain a humongous loan of N12bn in a most opaque manner and for highly questionable purposes of absolutely no relevance whatsoever to the good people of Delta State.” However, in a swift reaction, the PDP called attention to the deception of the APC in the state and accused it of crying wolf where none existed. The state Publicity Secretary of the party, Dr Ifeanyi Osuoza, in a statement dismissed the APC’s rant as cheap and a non-event. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
