The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Mr Abiodun Alabi, has assured residents that their fundamental human rights will be respected under his watch. Alabi, according to a statement on Monday, said this during the 2022 retreat organised by the Board of Trustees of the Lagos State Security Trust Fund on Victoria Island. He said, “My policing agenda for the state can be summarised as ‘Visibility policing’ and to achieve this, the Rapid Response Squad will be strengthened to ensure quick response to emergencies. “As we have deliberated extensively on the various security matters in the state and how to reposition the LSSTF to meet the demands of our security agencies, I want to assure residents that their fundamental human rights will be respected and not violated under my watch. “I commend the state government under Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for his proactive approach and support as the trust fund continues to be the only veritable organ for the sustenance of security of lives and property.” The Commander of Rapid Response Squad, Olayinka Egbeyemi, explained the importance of a vibrant and well-kitted squad in order to facilitate safety and security in the state as the campaign activities of the 2023 general elections approach.
