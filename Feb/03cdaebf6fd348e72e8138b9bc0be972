The Lagos State Government on Wednesday held a send-off for 13 permanent secretaries who retired from the state civil service in 2021. The Head of Service, Mr Hakeem Muri-Okunola, commended the retirees in recognition of their outstanding contributions to the growth of the state during the send-off event held in Alausa, Ikeja. He said, “Indeed, it is no mean feat to celebrate 35 years of a meritorious public service career in any public service in the world and I urge you to be deliberate in paying attention to your personal health and wellness, particularly considering the frequency of mutation of COVID-19. “In the same vein, you now have a better opportunity to deploy your skills, wide knowledge, extensive administrative and managerial experience to add value to yourselves and your immediate communities, particularly the youths, who are expected to bear the burden of leadership after us.” Responding on behalf of the retirees, Mrs Deile Helen, expressed appreciation to the Lagos State Government for allowing them to serve, just as he advised those still in active service not to look back but ensure they contribute their quota to improve the lot of the state and humanity.
