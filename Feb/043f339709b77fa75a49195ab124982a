All Progressives Congress National Leader, Asiwaju Bola  Tinubu, has described the late Magajin Garin of Sokoto (Head of Sokoto Caliphate Kingmakers), Alhaji Hassan Danbaba, as a man who devoted most of his life to the development of the caliphate and contributed immensely to the propagation of Islam in Nigeria. According to a statement on Tuesday, Tinubu, accompanied by some white cap chiefs from Lagos on Monday visited the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar, and the family of the late Magajin Garin to condole them over the loss. The APC leader was said to have been received in Sokoto by the former governor of the state, Senator Aliyu Wamakko, who led Tinubu’s delegation to the family house of the late Hassan where they offered prayers for the bereaved family. At Sultan Abubakar’s Palace, Tinubu said, “Losing Magajin Garin at such a tender age can be painful indeed. It is even more hurtful that this passing came barely a year after we lost his mother, Hajiya A’ishatu, the eldest daughter of the late Premier of Northern Nigeria, Sir Ahmadu Bello. I understand your pain and I share in it.”
