The Consul General of the Ghana High Commission, Samata Bukari,  has said the increased synergy fostered by the activities of the Ghana-Nigeria Business Council will strengthen economic ties between the two West African giants. Bukari said this during the GNBC CEO Forum held in Lagos as part of concerted efforts to smoothen the business relationship between the two countries. She said, “Let me reiterate that we in Ghana have always sought to maintain and consolidate the warm friendly relations our country has with the Federal Republic of Nigeria as a matter of national interest. It is a matter of fact that our two countries and peoples have much in common and are bound by many long lasting ties of cooperation. “Relations between Ghana and Nigeria have been characterised and sustained by regular high-level consultative visits. In fact, Abuja has become a busy conference post, as virtually no week passes without officials of one MDA or the other from Ghana coming for a programme. This is true even during this pandemic period. “It is a matter of fact that mutual understanding of the economies of our two countries with a positive attitude would further promote and strengthen our bilateral relations and escalate the growth of business cooperation. I am hopeful that you will have a better and correct understanding of the Ghanaian market at the end of this forum. “To that extent, let me once again express the Government of the Republic of Ghana’s avowed readiness to cooperate, collaborate and work closely with the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the sustainable development of the economies of our two countries.”  Copyright PUNCH.
