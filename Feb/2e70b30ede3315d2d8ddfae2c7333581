The Lagos State Head of Service, Mr Hakeem Muri-Okunola, has urged executives of the Nigerian Union of Journalists, Lagos Information Chapel, to ensure they leave a lasting legacy during their tenure. The HoS was quoted to have made the call during a courtesy visit by the NUJ team to his office in Alausa, Ikeja, according to a statement on Saturday. He said, “The legacy you leave behind when your term is over is the most important achievement that you will be remembered for as executives of the union. I also promise to critically look into all the issues raised, which include the provision of a union bus and the Higher National Diploma and Bachelor of Science dichotomy in accordance with public service rules and without prejudice to extant circulars.” The chairman of the NUJ Lagos Information Chapel, Mr Debo Adeniji, appealed to the HoS to regulate the deductions made from the chapel. “There is the need for regularising some members’ check-off dues being deducted into the coffers of other unions because this restricts the ability of the chapel to commit financial resources to programmes and carry out welfare activities,” he said.
