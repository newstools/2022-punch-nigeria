Eko Electricity Distribution Company, on Friday, apologised to its customers for reduced power supply and cites low allocation from the national grid as the cause. The power firm said it had expressed concern about “the persistent low allocation of power supply it has received from the Transmission Company of Nigeria lately,” adding that it had been unable to meet the supply demands of its customers. The company’s spokesperson, Mr Godwin Idemudia, said in a statement, “The total current allocation of power supply from the TCN to the various power stations in our network has dropped from 450MW to 156MW. “For example, the expected supply allocation to the Alagbon transmission substation is 100MW but we are currently receiving 67MW while Ijora transmission substation expects an average of 75MW but is currently receiving 13MW. This is nowhere near enough to satisfy our customers.” Idemudia apologised to customers for the inconvenience this might have caused and assured them that Eko Disco was actively working with the TCN to proffer a prompt resolution to the issue.
