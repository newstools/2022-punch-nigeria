The Ogun State Commissioner for Budget and Planning, Mr Olaolu Olabimtan, has enjoined statisticians to develop strategies that will assist the state in designing a blueprint towards the effective implementation of all government policies and programmes. Olabimtan made the call in Abeokuta during a courtesy visit by the leadership of the State Bureau of Statistics, describing statistics as a critical tool required for effective governance and socio-economic development of any entity, according to a statement. He said the decision to transform the old Department of Statistics into a full-fledged bureau by the Dapo Abiodun-led administration was apt. “Any nation, state, or local council that desires to develop and thrive requires to do things differently in a better, systematic and scientific manner. In Nigeria, all we do is just grope in the dark and end up making unnecessary and unwise decisions that will not be favourable to good governance,” he said. Congratulating the bureau for the feats recorded within a year of its transition, Olabimtan, who is also the chairman of the bureau’s Governing Board, called on the bureau to develop proactive policies, programmes, processes and activities capable of adding value to every citizen’s livelihood.
