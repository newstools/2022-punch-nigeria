Nigerian singer, David Adeleke, popularly known as Davido, has promised to host 50 fans at his private welcome party in London. The singer had arrived in London on Wednesday ahead of his concert at the O2 Arena. On his Twitter page on Saturday, the Champion Sound crooner revealed that he’d host a private welcome party with 50 “lucky” fans. The singer, however, stated that the welcome party would be held on Sunday, adding that more details about the event would be shared soon. He tweeted, “London private welcome party tomorrow. 50 lucky fans will get access. Details coming soon!” The award-winning singer first announced his concert at the O2 Arena in September 2021. The If crooner first performed at the London O2 Arena in January 2019 where he boasted of selling out the 20,000 capacity auditorium. However, Wizkid was the first Nigerian to headline a show at the O2 Arena in 2018, where he also sold out the venue. Burna Boy also performed at the O2 Arena on August 2021 after his Grammy win.
