Popular filmmaker and founder of EbonyLife studios, Mo Abudu, has opened up on her failed marriage, as she stated that she and her ex-husband, Tokunbo, were still friends. She made this known in an interview with media personality, Chude Jideonwo, published on Monday. Abudu said, “I don’t think that because you have decided to separate from your ex means that they were a bad human being, no. “Tokunbo Abudu, I’ll say it till tomorrow, is a good father. He remains a good friend of mine. That’s the most important thing in our relationship and we have two children together. “My children love their father and they love me, they don’t need to pick, they don’t need to say ‘is it mummy or daddy?’. “When my son graduated, we were both there. When it was Temidayo’s wedding, we planned it together, we were both there. “I’m not saying that some relationships can’t end badly and then there could be bitterness. But there wasn’t. There was no bitterness in our relationship. “It didn’t work, it didn’t work, and that’s it. We are good friends.” When asked why she separated despite being good friends with her ex-husband, Abudu answered, “It didn’t work because there are other things that make up a relationship outside of just being friends. There were so many other things in the equation at the time.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
