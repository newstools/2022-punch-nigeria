In this episode of So This Happened, we reviewed the ruling of the Abuja Division of the Federal High court which stated that the police have the power to sack any unmarried policewoman who gets pregnant. We also reviewed the tragic incident involving a 15-month-old baby, who was crushed to death by a driver in Delta State. Lastly, a 31-year-old former student of the Delta State University, Abraka, Mr Thaddeus Ifeanyi, has dragged the institution before the National Human Rights Commission over the low grade awarded to him upon the completion of his academic programme.
