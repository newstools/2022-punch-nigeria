Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said illegal oil bunkering is the worst form of economic sabotage, pointing out that no responsible state government will allow such illegal act to thrive. He said even if his political party; the Peoples Democratic Party, was in the opposition, his administration would not allow such illicit act in the state. Wike said the war against illegal refining of crude oil was not about political party but about Nigeria and its survival. He stated that it was also about ensuring that the health of Rivers people was not endangered. The Rivers State Governor made these remarks during a security meeting he had with heads of security agencies in the State and five Local Government Chairman at Government House in Port Harcourt on Friday and made available to newsmen by his media aide, Kekvin Ebiri. “The mere fact that I am in opposition does not mean that I have to sabotage the economy of the nation. This country belongs to all of us and you know that oil is the major source of revenue for the federation that the three tiers of government share from.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
