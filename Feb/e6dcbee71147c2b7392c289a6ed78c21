A political advocacy body, Nigeria Frontier Group, has advised Nigerians and especially social media analysts to focus on the message contents of aspirants seeking nominations of their political parties for the 2023 general elections. This was contained in a statement by the NFG Founder/Convener, Fidel Otuya, on Sunday in Abuja. “We observe that there has been an unnecessary, but distracting focus on the person instead of the agenda content of the individual. “In so doing, we may miss the core ingredient of the elected versus elector’s conversation, and hence we may march to the polling unit on voting day and unsure of what candidate to vote for. “This is the time to pay attention to what the candidates seek to offer to poor families, old pensioners, economically-disadvantaged and vulnerable segments, public infrastructure deficits, rural-urban migrations and industrialization and youth unemployment,” he said. Otuya added, “These are weighty challenges facing most Nigerian families and therefore they look up to politicians to address. “Unfortunately, we observe that most analysts, pontificating along ethnic, cultural and hate lines choose to obfuscate the conversation with selfish and mundane motives that do not to search for solutions to numerous problems of the country, most of which emanate from our communities, spills into the state and ends up as a problem caused by Aso Rock. “We commend President Muhammadu Buhari, the National Assembly and Nigerian stakeholders for the robust engagement that led to the formulation of the New Electoral Law (2022).” “While there is no perfect, or ideal state, there cannot be a perfect governing Act also. However, it is incumbent on all citizens, and responsible as we all are, to respect the content and spirit of the new electoral law. Such is the only way to grow.” (NAN)
