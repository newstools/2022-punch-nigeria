A 29-year-old Kaduna based tailor, Gado Yahaya, has allegedly killed his neighbour during an argument over a bucket of water. According to a resident of Rigasa in Igabi Local Government Area of the state, the tailor fought with one Liman Salisu which led to the death of Salisu. “He is a resident of Rigasa in Kaduna State and was arraigned on charges of culpable homicide before a Kaduna Magistrate Court on Monday,” he said. The tailor appeared before the Kaduna Magistrate Court in the Rigasa area on Monday, looking pale and remorseful. The prosecutor, Inspector Chidi Leo, alleged that Yahaya killed Salisu with a pestle during their fight over the bucket of water. This was contained in a confessional statement written and signed by Yahaya when brought to the police station, according to the Prosecutor. “In the course of the fight, he went into the kitchen, picked a pestle and hit Salisu on his head. He slumped after he was hit on the head and died on the way to the hospital,” the Prosecutor said. He said the offence contravened the provisions of Section 190 of the Penal Code of Kaduna State, 2017. The court, however, directed the police to forward the case file to the State Director of Public Prosecution for legal advice and adjourned the matter to March 9, 2022, for mention. Consequently, the Chief Magistrate, Ibrahim Emmanuel, ordered that Yahaya be remanded in a correctional facility and declined to take his plea on the grounds that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter.
