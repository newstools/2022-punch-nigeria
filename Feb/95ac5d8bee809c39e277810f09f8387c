Following her stellar performance for Leicester City Women, new Super Falcons’ defender Ashleigh Plumptre has been nominated for the English Women’s Super League player of the month for February, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The 23-year-old defender has been crucial in the club’s recent impressive outing after a shaky start to the season. In the month under review, Plumptre made two appearances for Leicester City Women, helping her side to two victories and also got her a name on the score sheet with a fine header. The defender also helped keep a clean sheet in her side’s third win of the season after 15 matches played. The Women’s Super League on Monday released their shortlist for player of the month for February with the Falcons defender making the shortlist. Battling for the Barclay’s monthly award with the Nigerian are Chelsea duo Ann-Katrin Berger and Jess Carter, Aston Villa’s Alisha Lehmann, Ashleigh Neville of Tottenham Hotspur and Leicester teammate Jemma Purfield. It’s been a good year for the former England U-23 player, who made her debut for the Falcons against Ivory Coast last Friday, after her request to switch her nationality from England to Nigeria was approved last month. Plumptre debuted on a winning note as the Falcons beat the Lady Elephants 2-0 victory in the first of their final qualifier for the 2022 Women Africa Cup of Nations. Copyright PUNCH.
