Peoples Democratic Party’s presidential hopeful, Atiku Abubakar, on Saturday, visited ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo in Abeokuta, Ogun State. Atiku arrived at the Hilton Towers of Obasanjo at exactly 10:10am and was received by the strongman of Ogun politics. His visit was not unconnected to his 2023 presidential ambition. The main challenger of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), in the 2019 presidential election has been going around the country, meeting with political heavyweights to seek support to occupy the much-coveted seat in Aso Rock in 2023. Atiku deputised Obasanjo as Vice-President between 1999 and 2007 but the duo fell apart towards the twilight of their second term. It, however, appeared they had reconciled over the years.
