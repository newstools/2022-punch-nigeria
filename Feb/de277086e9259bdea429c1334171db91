The Senate on Tuesday passed a bill to establish the School of Mines and Geological Studies, Guyuk. Also passed was the Federal Universities of Technology Act 2004 (Amendment) Bill, 2022. The chamber, with the passage of the FUTA (Amendment) bill, gave approval for the upgrade of the Federal Polytechnic, Offa, Kwara State, from a Diploma awarding institution to a full-fledged Degree awarding Federal University of Technology. The passage of both bills followed the consideration of two separate reports by the Committee on Tertiary Institutions and TETFUND. Chairman of the Committee, Senator Ahmad Babba Kaita, in his presentation, said that establishing the school of mines and geological studies would provide for the training of middles and junior level manpower for the mineral and mining sector. He added that it would also facilitate collaboration with other national and international institutions involved in general exploration and mining of precious stones and ore as well as encourage teacher training, research, and general development of teacher education.
