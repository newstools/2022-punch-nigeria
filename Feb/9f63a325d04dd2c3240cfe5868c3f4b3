The ladies’ wing of the Yoruba Tennis Club has said it will partner with the Lagos State Government to train youths in digital and employability skills. The Chairman of YTC, Mr Jide Damazio, said this in a statement on Tuesday. He said, “The Lagos State Government is partnering the Yoruba Tennis Club ladies’ wing on digital literacy as part of efforts to reduce unemployment among youths. This initiative for youths was geared at ensuring that participants not only attain employable skills but also become employers of labour. “The two-week digital skill acquisition training programme will feature corporate Information and Communications Technology experts who will impact knowledge on modern and employable skills that are relevant in the digital age to youths drawn from various disciplines including medicine, journalism, ICT and engineering.” The Chairman of the ladies’ wing of YTC, Mrs Olasunbo Damazio, said the training is one of the initiatives organised by the group. “The training, which was unveiled on February 14, is one of the critical initiatives pioneered by the YTC aimed at fostering the development and general well-being of various communities in Lagos State,” she said.
