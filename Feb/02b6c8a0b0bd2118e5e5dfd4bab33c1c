Striker Taiwo Awoniyi will be hoping to grab his 10th Bundesliga goal of the season when Union Berlin travel to face Augsburg on Saturday (today). It’s Awoniyi’s first game after his return from the Africa Cup of Nations, where he grabbed a goal in three appearances for the Eagles in their short-lived campaign. The striker will also be hoping to use the game to return to scoring ways after failing to grab a goal or assist in his last three Bundesliga games before jetting off for the AFCON. Awoniyi has made 17 appearances for Union and his nine goals in the ongoing Bundesliga campaign places him as the sixth joint top scorer in the league along with RB Leipzig’s Christopher Nkunku. The 24-year-old is Union’s top scorer this season followed by Max Kruse, who has five goals in 16 appearances. Awoniyi has been an immense signing for the club following a €6.5m move from Premier League giants Liverpool in the summer, having spent the 2019/20 season with the German side on a season-long loan deal. The Nigerian has scored 14 goals for the club in 27 games across all competitions, with three assists. His performance has seen his value jump from €8m in June to €15m as of December 2022, according to trusted football statistics website, Transfermarkt. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
