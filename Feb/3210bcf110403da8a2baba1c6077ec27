Glasgow Rangers defender Leon Balogun has backed his former manager Steven Gerrard to replace Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool in the future. The Nigerian defender who has been missing in action since he limped off in the 2-0 win over Hibernian FC earlier this month, opened up on the departure of Gerrard, but remains confident the former England international’s exit from Ibrox won’t derail an “outstanding job” by new gaffer Giovanni van Bronckhorst. The Liverpool legend led the Ibrox club to the Premiership title last season but jumped ship for Aston Villa late last year. Van Bronckhorst stepped into the breach and the former Brighton defender believes the Gers are very much in contention for a second successive league win. “It’s now clear to many that at some point Steven Gerrard will go ‘home’ and become a Liverpool manager,” Balogun was quoted as saying by Daily Record. “There had to be a stopover and Aston Villa was a very good possibility. “It was a shame he left because Steven Gerrard has had a mission here in Glasgow for three years, built something and had done an outstanding job. “I came here in 2020 after a rather difficult period in my career and Gerrard and his team handed me incredible confidence in myself. “You realise how important it is for him to convey his idea to the players, which mainly includes possession of the ball. Balogun who has made 22 appearances for the Gers scoring once is expected to miss Sunday’s clash with Dundee United. Rangers are currently placed second in the SPL log – one point adrift leaders Celtic. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
