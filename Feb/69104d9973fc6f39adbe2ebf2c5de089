HR Expo Africa has said it will train employers and employees through its 2022 Work Festival conference on the future of work in a technology-driven world. The founder of HREA, Erefa Coker, said this in a statement in Lagos on Monday, adding that the training would hold in April. She said, “At this year’s HR Expo Africa event, we will be sharing wholesomely about what you need for success in a rapidly transforming world where new innovations are being developed every day that affect both employees and employers alike, such as artificial intelligence-powered machines or augmented reality. “The rapid changes since the technology was introduced into the workplace have led us to experience major transformations like those offered by emerging technologies currently available today, such as artificial intelligence-powered machines or augmented reality and many more. Over these years, we have had over 1000 sessions, 300 speakers, and 10,000 attendees who experienced this transformative event.” The Product Growth Manager, Propel Petroleum, Mr Taiwo Ajayi, noted that the conference would be important for managers, team leads, policymakers, and employees. “Work Festival 2022 is designed to answer questions, create solutions and ignite new ideas for change which will be achieved by bringing together C-levels executives, stellar speakers, and professionals to discuss emerging trends in human capacity development, technology, better wellbeing, and organisational performance as it relates to various sectors of the economy and not excluding government parastatals and agencies,” he said.
