The Lagos State government has instructed the Commander, Rapid Response Squad, CSP Yinka Egbeyemi, to deploy patrol teams to Agege and Abule Egba areas of the state in search of trouble makers. This is following intelligence that some hoodlums are bent on fomenting trouble by attacking the state headquarters of the National Union of Road Transport Workers in Agege and causing mayhem around Agege and Abule Egba. In a statement shared on Facebook by the RRS, the state government warned that it would deal decisively with troublemakers bent on using NUTRW as an excuse to cause chaos in the state. “While directing that the areas be heavily patrolled and trouble makers arrested and brought to face justice, the government advised aggrieved people to employ legitimate channels to express their grievances. “Road users and people around Agege and Abule Egba are advised to go about their lawful activities as government has deployed law enforcers to the area to ensure law and order is maintained,” the statement read in part.
