A group, South-East Nigeria Democratic League, has called on the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, to run for the presidency of Nigeria. The group described Amaechi as the most competent, capable and prepared person, with leadership capabilities to lead a present day Nigeria. The coordinator, Jude Okoye, who spoke to journalists in Awka, on Sunday, said Amaechi had acquitted himself creditably both as governor of Rivers State and as minister, supervised the infrastructural rejuvenation with tremendous work on the railway system across Nigeria. Okoye said, “As the Muhammadu Buhari administration nears terminal date, it is very clear that what the country needs now is a courageous, hardworking and widely accepted person with good knowledge of the system to carry on with the ongoing infrastructure rebirth and reforms that can ensure survival of the country in spite of multifarious challenges. “Amaechi, undoubtedly, fits the bill.” He described Amaechi as a detribalised Nigerian with the requisite widespread acceptance across the country’s ethnic nationalities. He said Amaechi’s detribalised nature was the reason he was recently turbaned as Dan Amanar Daura in far Katsina State.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
