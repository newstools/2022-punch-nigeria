Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has hailed the pilot who landed a plane carrying the club’s players during Storm Dudley on Thursday. The pilot had tried to land the plane in Manchester amid bad weather but was forced to head to Liverpool before the plane could land. His calm approach to the situation and the way he kept on reassuring the passengers earned Guardiola’s praise. “To be honest, when I saw the video I said ‘wow, it was more scary than we felt’,” Guardiola explained in his pre-match press conference ahead of City’s clash with Tottenham. “It was bumping a lot, but it was a moment where we were going down and immediately the engine started to go up, and we realised something happened. “We had a pilot who did incredibly well in talking to us. He was so calm and said we would try and land in Manchester again and, when that failed, he told us we would go to Liverpool. “He was magnificent. Thanks to his words and how he talked to us, everyone was calm.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
