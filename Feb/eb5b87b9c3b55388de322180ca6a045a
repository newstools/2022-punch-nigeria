He was on his way to Anambra from Abuja when the gunmen attacked their vehicle” a tear-filled Mr Gambo Ibrahim said of the deceased. “After waylaying them, the gunmen opened fire on them killing all of them except the driver who escaped.

I am so shocked,” Binta Musawa, Mr Sule’s coursemate stated.
