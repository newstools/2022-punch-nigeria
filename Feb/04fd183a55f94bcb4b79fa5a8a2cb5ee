The Chief Executive Officer, Life Afrique Social Foundation, Tokunbo Olumilua, has called on philanthropists and well-meaning Nigerians to come to the aid of their primary schools by providing for their needs. Olumilua, said many had forgotten about their primary schools where their educational foundation was laid, saying government alone could not take the schools to the desired standard. The CEO, who spoke at his alma mater, L.A Primary School, Odo Oja, Ikere Ekiti, where he had gone to celebrate his birthday with the pupils, lauded Ekiti State Government for the transformation which the school had witnessed in the last 32 years that he passed out of there. He said, “This is not how we left this school! Those old structures and the classrooms we left here have been demolished by the government to pave way for new structures and the ones under construction. The state government is trying.” Olumilua who, on behalf of the non-profit organisation, presented writing materials, textbooks, instructional materials and learning aids to the pupils and as well as modular textbooks to boost teaching and learning, said the scope of the gesture would be expanded.
