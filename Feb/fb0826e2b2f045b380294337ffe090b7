President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has appointed Senator Emmanuel Bwacha as Chairman of the Committee on Procurement. Lawan announced Bwacha’s appointment at the opening of plenary on Wednesday. The appointment came about one week after Bwacha defected from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party to the ruling All Progressives Congress, and 24 hours after he officially notified the chamber. The National Chairman of the PDP, Iyorchia Ayu, had in a letter to the Senate on Tuesday nominated Senator Shuaibu Lau as the new Deputy Minority Leader, an office that Bwacha occupied until his defection. Also on Wednesday, the Senate President announced Lau’s appointment as the Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Works. While Lau represents Taraba North Senatorial District, Bwacha represents Taraba South.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
