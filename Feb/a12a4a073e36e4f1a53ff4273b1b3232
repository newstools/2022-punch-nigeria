The Senator Ibrahim Shekarau-led faction of the All Progressives Congress in Kano State has rejected the guidelines for the harmonization of the party structure in the state as released by the national headquarters of the party. Recall that the APC on Monday released guidelines for the harmonization of the party structure in Kano in which Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje was appointed as head of the National /State Joint Supervisory Committee with Shekarau as his assistant in a letter signed by the Chief of Staff to the National Chairman, Abdullahi Gashua, dated February 7, 2022. However, the Kano G7 in a letter by the Joint Stakeholders Forum of the APC dated February 7, 2022, titled, ‘RE: Guidelines For The Harmonization Of The Party Structure In Kano State,’ rejected in its entirety the content of the letter from the party headquarters, noting that it is unacceptable to its members. The letter jointly signed by the seven-member forum and addressed to the National Chairman, Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, APC, read, “To our utter dismay and disenchantment, the letter had gone viral in the social media emanating from Kano State Government circles even before reaching us mischievously paraded as conclusive evidence that the party would be surrendered to the H. E. Dr Abdullahi Ganduje faction. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
