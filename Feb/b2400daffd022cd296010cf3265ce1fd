VICE President Atiku Abubakar on Tuesday urged the residents and members of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Federal Capital Territory to come out en masse to exercise their franchise during the council elections holding on Saturday. Atiku made the call in a statement signed by his media adviser, Paul Ibe. He said this the council elections in the FCT should be a referendum of sorts on the performance of the All Progressives Congress administration in the country. The statement quoted Atiku as asking the people of the FCT to use their ballot to tell the APC government how its administration has made life difficult for the common man. “The records of performance between the PDP and APC administrations should provide a guide for the way the people of the FCT should cast their ballot on Saturday. “I expect every member of the PDP to be proud of the party at this election and even mobilise their families and friends to vote for PDP’s candidates across all the FCT councils on Saturday,” Atiku said. The 2019 presidential candidate of the PDP also called on all the officials including security agents who will be involved in the conduct of the FCT elections to ensure it was conducted in line with all relevant provisions that will make the process hitch-free and credible.
