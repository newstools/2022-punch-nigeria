The Federal Government has commenced an empowerment programme and training for hundreds of rehabilitated drug addicts by providing livestock for the beneficiaries in Kano State. It said the new scheme was currently engaging 500 women and youths in livestock farming, according to a statement issued in Abuja by the National Agriculture Land Development Authority. The authority stated that NALDA in collaboration with the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency and Salamah Youth Empowerment and Enlightenment Initiative gave out three goats each to 100 women, while a total of 200 youths received cows. The Executive Secretary, NALDA, Paul Ikonne, explained that one cow would be jointly managed by two youths, hence 100 cows would be shared among the 200 youths, as 500 beneficiaries would benefit in the first phase of the empowerment programme. The exercise, according to the statement from NALDA, was done at the Central Abattoir, Kofarmazugal, Kano. The agency stated that the first phase of the exercise would be completed in March 2022. Ikonne explained that the beneficiaries were being trained in animal husbandry and financial management in order to effectively manage their various businesses. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
