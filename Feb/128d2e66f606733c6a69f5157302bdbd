The Lagos State Head of Service, Mr Hakeem Muri-Okunola, has urged stakeholders of the Lagos State Public Procurement Agency to boost the confidence of foreign and local investors in the state. The HoS, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary of the Public Service Office, Mr Samson Ajibade, said this on Wednesday during the annual procurement planning clinic organised by the agency. He said, “I commend the agency for the concerted efforts it has been making in sensitising stakeholders on the amended Lagos State Public Procurement Law. “Through hard work, perseverance, commitment and determination, the agency has left no one in doubt that there is no room for circumventing the law by any contractor, supplier or service provider doing business with the state government. “I enjoin both the internal and external stakeholders of LSPPA to continue to advance the course of good governance in their various offices to engender the confidence of local and foreign investors in the state.” The Commissioner for Finance, Dr Rabiu Olowo, commended Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for signing the public procurement law which empowered the agency. “The new Public Procurement Bill signed into Law by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu is aimed at further empowering the agency to discharge its duties more effectively and also empowering service providers by increasing the mobilisation fee from 20 per cent to 40 per cent of the contract sum so that they can finance contracts awarded to them with relative ease,” he said.
