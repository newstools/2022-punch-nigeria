The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr Zainab Ahmed, has said the whistleblower policy will strengthen the fight against corruption. Ahmed, according to a statement on Thursday, said the South-West zone which requested for the policy would be sensitised to it. The minister, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Finance (Special Duties), Mr Shehu Shinkafi, was quoted to have said this during a conference organised by the ministry in Alausa, Ikeja. She said, “The South-West has requested for the protection of whistleblower policy to guide against unforeseen circumstances that arise in the past and guiding against the future occurrences. The primary goal of this policy is to strengthen the fight against financial crimes and corruption by revealing information on financial crimes and rewarding whistleblowers. “The policy is the result of President Muhammadu Buhari administration’s resolve to vigorously fight corruption in the country which is one of the campaign promises made to Nigerians on the build-up to the 2015 general elections.” The Lagos State Commissioner for Finance, Dr Rabiu Olowo, said the policy was important to Lagos State as it was the economic hub of the country. “The South-West zonal conference is historic because of the importance of Lagos which is the hub of economic activities of the country as majority of private sector investments are domiciled in the state. The policy has benefits in protecting whistleblowers and confidence in the reporting procedures looking at its theoretical and cultural angles,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
