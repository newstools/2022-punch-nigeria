Kanye West is backing down on his social media attack against his estranged wife, Kim Kardashian, and her partner, Pete Davidson. On Sunday, the Donda rapper went on a social media tirade against the couple when he made several posts on Instagram expressing his discontent about their relationship. Tagging Davidson “garbage” and d***head, the rapper vowed that the comedian would never be allowed to meet his children, whom he shares with Kardashian. Reacting to the posts, Kim had warned West via private text that his attacks on social media could cause danger to her boyfriend. On Tuesday, the rapper wiped his Instagram page clean of the said posts and also stated he was taking accountability for his actions. West shared a picture of himself standing alone on a platform and said he was currently working with experts to boost his communication skills. The rapper who usually captions his posts in all caps said, “I’ve learned that using all caps makes people feel like I’m screaming at them. I’m working on my communication. “I can benefit from a team of creative professionals, organisers, mobilisers, and community leaders. Thank everybody for supporting me.” He also acknowledged that “sharing screenshots was jarring and came off as harassing Kim.” “I take accountability. I’m still learning in real-time. I don’t have all the answers. To be good leader is to be a good listener,” he wrote. While Kim had filed divorce from West is February 2021, the rapper had made it clear that he was going to fight for the marriage. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
