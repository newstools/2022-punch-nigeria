An Ekiti State Chief Magistrate’s Court, Ado Ekiti, has remanded two teenagers, Oluwatimilehin Afolabi (19) and Kehinde Mustapha (19), in a custodial centre for allegedly attempting to murder a 23-year-old lady. They were arraigned on one count of attempted murder. The charge read, “The defendants, on February 2, 2022, in Ikere Ekiti, did conspire and attempt to murder one 23-year-old Blessing, contrary to sections 516 and 320 of the Criminal Code, Cap. C16, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012.” In her statement to the police, the victim said, “I am a commercial sex worker in a brothel at Ikere Ekiti and Oluwatimilehin is my customer. On that day, he called me around 8.55pm to meet him somewhere along Ise Ekiti Road, Ikere Ekiti. “On getting there, I met him as agreed. We were going together when suddenly Timilehin moved back and held my neck from the back. He strangled me until I became unconscious. After some time, I regained consciousness with blood gushing out of my mouth. I was rescued by some passersby. Timilehin was later arrested and he mentioned Kehinde as his herbalist.” The police prosecutor, Inspector Oriyomi Akinwale, urged the court to remand the two defendants. He said, “Remanding them will allow the police to complete their investigation and forward the duplicate case file to the Director of Public Prosecutions for legal advice.” In his ruling, the Chief Magistrate, Bankole Oluwasanmi, said, “The first and second defendants are to be taken to the Nigerian Correctional Centre, Ado Ekiti, and remanded there for a period of 30 days.” Oluwasanmi adjourned the matter till March 10 for mention.
