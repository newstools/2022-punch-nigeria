The Indigenous People of Biafra on Saturday accused the Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, and security agencies in the country of masterminding the incessant abductions and killings in the South-East. In a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, the group alleged that regional security outfit, Ebubeagu, in collaboration with the Nigerian Army and police killed scores of innocent youths in many communities in the Orsu and Orlu local government areas of the state. The group said the affected communities included Oboh Umutanze, Attah, Okporo, Amaifeke, Ihioma, Ama-azu, Amannachi, Nnempi, Akata, Orsuihiteukwa and Umutanze. The statement also quoted Powerful as saying that it was imperative to call “Uzodinma and his gang to order and ask him why he used soldiers and police personnel to eliminate innocent Biafran youths”. He said mortuaries across the region, especially in Imo State, were filled with unclaimed corpses, who were buried in a mass grave or destroyed with acid from time to time, adding that the atrocities committed by Uzodinma extended to many communities in the region. The statement read in part, “We are asking Uzodinma and his APC party: why do they derive joy in killing innocent Biafra youths in a cold-blood while Fulani bandits and terrorists go unchallenged in their killing spree across Nigeria? What crime did Imo youths commit to deserve the ongoing secret genocide in the state? “We call on the United Nations, America, British High Commissioner, Israeli Ambassador, German Ambassador, French Ambassador, Canadian Ambassador, Japanese Ambassador, Australian Ambassador, Amnesty International, Intersociety groups, Human Rights Watch and all human rights organisations across the globe to send an investigation team to these communities and find out what the situation is. “They will confirm to their amazement that nobody is dwelling in these communities. The youths and people have been indiscriminately and mercilessly killed by the Fulani terrorist soldiers deployed in Imo State by the Federal Government in collaboration with Hope Uzodinma.” “IPOB is out now to expose these atrocities committed by Hope Uzodinma, Nigeria Army and police including, Ebubeagu security outfit. It’s too appalling that the Ebubeagu security outfit would join hands in killing our people and call them unknown gunmen. History will judge them all.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
