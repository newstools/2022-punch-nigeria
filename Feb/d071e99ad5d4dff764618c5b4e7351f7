The Akwa Ibom State Coalition for Osinbajo 2023 has called on Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to throw his hat in the ring and contest the presidential election in the country. The group described the VP as a man with the Midas touch, adding that he appealed to all the demographic groups, including youths and women. The state Coordinator of the group, Edidiong Idiong, who said this while addressing supporters after a road walk in support of the VP at the Ibom Unity park on Saturday, added that Nigeria deserves the best at the moment. He said, “We are here gathered today to create awareness and sensitise our people and call on the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, to throw his hat into the ring and contest for the office of the president in 2023. “Osinbajo is the man with the Midas touch; he has the capacity, very articulate, he appeals to all demographic groups, and I don’t see anybody who has the kind of experience that he had.” While admitting that the VP was yet to officially signify interest, Idiong said the rally was a way of encouraging him to contest the election by creating awareness and sending the message to the Vice President. A woman leader, Eno Inyang, said the women were also rooting for Osinbajo because he has the interest of women at heart “as seen through the provision of soft loans to traders,” stating that she believed if the vice president eventually becomes the President, the women would enjoy.
