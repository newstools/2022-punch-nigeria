A former Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon (retd.), is billed to chair the public presentation of a book authored by the Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi.
According to a statement on Tuesday by Mr Cornelius Onuoha, Managing Director of RedGecko Limited, organisers of the event, the book titled “Unfinished Greatness: Envisioning a New Nigeria” will be presented in Abuja on February 24.
Onuoha added that the presentation will feature a keynote address by Prof. Adebayo Olukoshi, Professor, Wits School of Governance and Immediate Past Director for Africa and West Asia, International IDEA.
The statement added, “Dr. Joe Abah, the Nigeria Country Director, DAI Global, will be the book reviewer, with a stellar intergenerational line-up of panellists including Waziri Adio, Editorial Board Member, ThisDay Newspapers; Yemi Adamolekun, Executive Director, Enough-is-Enough Nigeria; Ndi Kato, Executive Director, Dinidari Africa; and Hamzat Bala Lawal, Founder and Executive Director, Connected Development.
“The foreword was written by a former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd.), and in it he said ‘The title Unfinished Greatness inspires hope in us that our march into the future is a purposeful journey of destiny.’
“In the words of Dr. John Dramani Mahama, former President of Ghana: ‘Nigeria remains central to the vision of an African renaissance. In Unfinished Greatness, Fayemi reminds us of the power of unity in nation building. The ideas in this book encapsulate the roadmap for peace and sustainable development in Nigeria, and indeed the rest of Africa.’”
The statement also quoted a former Minister of Education, Prof Tunde Adeniran, as stating that “Unfinished Greatness convincingly challenges false narratives about our trajectory as a country and offers profound historical insights to prove that there is more that unites us than our differences.”
