Nigerian comedian, Debo Adebayo, popularly known as Mr Macaroni, has stated that entertainment events and shows do not need to be put on hold before Nigerian youths focus on the upcoming elections. The comic skit maker who doubles as an #EndSARS activist made this comment while replying to a Twitter user who argued that Nigerian reality TV shows need to be shelved for youths to focus on choosing the right leaders in the 2023 elections. The Twitter user, @tarilamurphy, who had the comedian’s photo as his avatar, wrote, “I shall keep saying it. Let all those reality TV shows e.g. BBN (Big Brother Naija) take a pause this year. They should help the youths to focus on the 2023 elections. #EndSARS” Responding to the fan, Mr Macaroni disagreed, stating that “if the youths need shows or other events to pause before they can focus on elections, then the youths are not ready.” “Asking BBN to take a pause so that the youths can focus on election is not it,” he tweeted. “If that is it, then maybe football should also pause, maybe we should stop working too? Since you want to render other people jobless. “Make una no dey use my picture or name tweet nonsense o.” The comedian then asked the fan to desist from using his picture as Twitter avatar.
