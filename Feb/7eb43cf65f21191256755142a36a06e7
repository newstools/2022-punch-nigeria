Actress and filmmaker, Titilola Ajayi, is set to treat her fans to an exciting experience with the programme, Feast of love. In an interview with Sunday Scoop, she noted that it was her way of appreciating her fans for supporting her through the years. She said, “Everyone knows Valentine’s Day is a time to show love, though I believe love should be shown to others at all times. The event is a date put together by me and team to celebrate my fans. It’s my way of having a one-on-one interaction with my fans. It’s just a way of showing them that they matter to me. “The least we can do is to show love to one another. With the bad news we are constantly exposed to and the struggles experienced by the average Nigerian, love is all we need at this time, not hate.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
