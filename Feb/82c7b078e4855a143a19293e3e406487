The Academic Staff Union of Universities has said the Nigerian government is against education and is unconcerned about development in the country. Speaking after a rally and congress at the University of Lagos, which was used to round off the ASUU Lagos Zone mobilisation, the Zone Coordinator, Dr Adelaja Odukoya, said they were tired of government’s promises without implementation. He added that the government was unresponsive to their appeals. The lecturers called on the Federal Government to sign and implement the renegotiated 2009 ASUU/FGN Agreement which was expected to be reviewed every three years. He said, “This sensitisation is, therefore, intended to bring to the public knowledge the refusal of government to honour the agreement freely entered into with our union in December 2020 before the strike was suspended.” The five universities comprising ASUU Lagos Zone are the University of Lagos, Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, Lagos State University, and the Tai Solarin University of Education.
