A Nigerian nurse based in the United States, Faduri Joseph, has vowed to end insecurity and the face-off between ASUU and government when elected President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, come 2023. The 45-year-old presidential aspirant made the promise through his Delta State coordinator, Tessy Ebegbune, during a familiarisation visit to the university community, Abraka, in Ethiop East Local Government Area of Delta State. He said, “When elected as the President of this country, I will put an end to insecurity in all part of the country and stop the incessant killings of human being because life is precious. “Most importantly, I will end the lingering face-off between Academic staff Union of Universities and government which had resulted in unending strikes. We will ensure that our children finished their studies when due. “My government will address the matter squarely as well as tackle the unemployment matter that have crumbled the nation’s economy.” He lamented how he spent five years after graduation from Nigerian University without employment before he left for the US, and ventured into music and acting. In his remark, the President of the Student Union Government, Delta State University, Comrade Cyprian Odifili, urged the Independent National Electoral Commission, to give Nigerians the best in the forthcoming general elections. Odifili stated that Nigerian students will not hesitate to reject any political aspirant/candidate who cannot protect the interest of Nigerian students. The students urged INEC to encourage independent candidacy, saying Nigerians are fed-up with political parties, but still hopeful that sooner or later, the Moses of our time will emerge, to lead Nigerians to the expected promised land.
