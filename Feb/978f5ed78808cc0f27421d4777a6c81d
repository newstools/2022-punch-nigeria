The All Progressives Congress, Zamfara State chapter, has kicked against the recent call on Governor Bello Mattawale to resign by the Peoples Democratic Party. In a statement, the APC publicity secretary, Alhaji Yusuf Idris, said Matawalle will not resign. Idris said the recent interview by the state PDP secretary, Faruku Ahmed, published in The PUNCH calling on the governor to resign was only ‘’an empty threat.’’ Idris said Matawalle would not resign, saying “his ascension to power is ordained by God”. The statement insinuated that the PDP has started feeling the heat of defeat in the coming 2023 general elections. “Looking at his submissions, Faruku raised some issues that confirmed his confused mind and that of his sponsors,’’ Idris noted. He disagreed with the PDP secretary that the state was better under former Governor Abdulaziz Yari’s administration in terms of security. “Is Faruku telling us that Governor Matawalle was in office when 250 persons were massively killed in one day at Yargaladima Village? What about those killed at Kizara, Birane, Dangulbi; those killed in tens and hundreds, daily kidnappings, cattle rustlings, rapes, the discretion of the Holy Qur’an and the burning of several villages?’’ he asked.
