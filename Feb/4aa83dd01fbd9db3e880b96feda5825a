The apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, has said since 2016, it gathered that over 900 Igbo youths have been languishing in prisons across the country because of their connection with the Biafra agitation. The group advised Igbo elite and politicians to include them in the peace move they were trying to broker on behalf of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. In a statement signed by the group’s Secretary-General, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, warned against ‘segregation’ in what is described as ‘classified negotiations between a few Igbo politicians, elder statesmen and the Federal Government for the release of the IPOB leader and other top Biafra agitators. Part of the statement read, “We have it in good authority that not more than 983 Biafran detainees are incarcerated in various correctional facilities across the seven Igbo-speaking states between 2016 and 2021.”  Copyright PUNCH.
