The Katsina State Government on Monday announced an immediate ban on volunteer group known as Yan sa Kai in the state. The state attributed the decision to the overzealous criminal activities of some members of the group. The group is made up of volunteers who claim to be assisting in security matters. A statement by the state governor’s Special Adviser on Security, Ibrahim Katsina, alleged that some members of the group engaged in extra judicial killings and looting. The statement clarified that only vigilante groups whose members operate under the command of the police are recognised by the state government. The statement, which was titled “Banning of the activities of Yan sa Kai volunteer group across Katsina State,” read, “The Katsina State Government has banned the activities of Yan Sa Kai due to the overzealous criminal activities of the volunteer (Yan Sa Kai) group in the state, which always resulted in extrajudicial killings of innocent persons and looting of their property. “In a statement signed by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Security Matters, the Katsina State Government has banned their activities across the state with immediate effect. “The statement further said the Katsina State Government only recognised the activities of vigilante group which is under the supervision, control and monitoring of the police, other security agencies and traditional institutions. “Henceforth, arrested suspects should be handed over to the police or any security agency for proper investigation and action where necessary.
