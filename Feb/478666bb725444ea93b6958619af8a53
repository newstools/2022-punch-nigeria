The United States said Monday it is relocating its embassy in Kyiv to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, citing a “dramatic acceleration” in the buildup of Russian forces at the country’s border. “The embassy will remain engaged with the Ukrainian government,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement, but “we strongly urge any remaining U.S. citizens in Ukraine to leave the country immediately.” AFP
