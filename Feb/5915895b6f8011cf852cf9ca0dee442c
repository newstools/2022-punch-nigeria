The fourth episode of the ongoing Glo Battle of the Year Nigeria dance reality show has taken a dramatic turn from BBoys to BGirls as the female contestants take their turn in the qualifying rounds. But the switch notwithstanding, viewers will be in for the same heady cocktail they have come to expect from the show; from mesmerising dances moves to dance floor drama and the joys and pains of victory and loss respectively. From Abuja to Lagos, the ladies make clear that when it comes to break dancing, men do not have a monopoly. The show’s host, Do2Tun, obviously shares the same sentiments as he said, “If you ever doubted the talent of the BGirls, after this episode, you will be a believer.” Aside from the BGirls, viewers will witness head-turning popping moves by poppers from the six venues as they battle to make their way to Lagos. As with all competitions, there will be winners and losers but the judges’ decisions are not final. The viewers have the power to alter those decisions by voting for their favourite contestants who did not make it past the regional qualifications. And for those viewers who can dance, Glo is spreading the cheer. They have the opportunity to post their dance videos on social media, and they could stand the chance to win N200,000 weekly.
