A pro-Senator Emmanuel Bwacha group, Bwacha Political Organisation has warned of a looming religious crisis in Taraba State. The group said two religious bodies are at daggers drawn, stating that if not well managed, it could lead to a full-blown crisis. Addressing journalists at a press conference in Abuja, the leader of the organisation, Rikwense Muri, accused the governor of the state, Darius Ishaku, of not sustaining the structures by past governors to keep the two religions together. He advised the governor to concentrate on the measures to unite the two religions in the state. He said, “Currently, a volatile situation is afoot with both Christians and Muslims bodies at each other’s throats. Christians and Muslims have always found ways to live together in the past because of the interfaith efforts of past governors. “Darius is not sustaining this but rather fanning the embers of religious strife. He is not able to manage the diversity of our state – a diversity that has been the basis of our unity for a long time. Rather, he is busy poorly playing divide and rule politics. If he is not called to order, he would plunge the state into a religious crisis.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
