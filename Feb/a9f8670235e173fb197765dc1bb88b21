Names of the chairmen of both Sokoto and Kano states were not on the list of those inaugurated and none of the factions in the two states were sworn in on Thursday. When contacted on Friday on why the party took the decision by excluding the chairmen of the two states among those inaugurated, the secretary of the party’s caretaker committee said there was nothing to worry about concerning the non-inauguration of the state executive party of Kano State. He said the party took the decision in the interest of its members in the state in particular and the country as a whole. He said, “We want peace and Kano is like the headquarters of our party.  We will not do anything that could affect the peace of the party there. Also, recall that the matter is still in court. So, we have not done anything wrong with our action.” He did not speak on why the chairman of the party in Sokoto State was not inaugurated. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
