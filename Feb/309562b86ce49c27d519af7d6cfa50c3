The President of the United States of America, Joe Biden has nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. This makes her the first Black woman to sit on the highest court in the country. This was made known in a report by the CNNetwork, monitored by our correspondent on Friday. President Biden who introduced her at the White House said, “For too long, our government, our courts haven’t looked like America. I believe it’s time that we have a court that reflects the full talents and greatness of our nation with a nominee of extraordinary qualifications, and that will inspire all young people to believe that they can one day serve their country at the highest level.” Jackson, 51, earned her Havard Law School degree in 1996, she was a Clerk for Justice Breyer before she was later appointed as the Vice-Chairperson of the US Sentencing Commission in 2009. She was the former judge at the District Court for the District Court of Columbia in 2012 and was confirmed with Bipartisan support in 2013. “And if I am fortunate to be the Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, I can only hope that my life and career, my love of this country and the constitution and my commitment to upholding the rule of law and the sacred principles upon which this great nation was founded, will inspire future generations of Americans,” Jackson said.
