The Academic Staff Union of Universities Abia State University Uturu, branch has declared lecture-free day. This was in obedience to the directive from ASUU’s National Secretariat and to mobilise her members, and sensitise the public on the looming strike action. During the Congress, it was resolved that ASUU-ABSU resolved to embark on any action to drive home its demands. ASUU embarked on an indefinite strike action in March, 2020 which lasted till December, 2020. The branch chairperson, Victor Nkemdirim, said, “During the period, the Union had entered into many memorandum of understanding and memorandum of actions, with the FGN. “As it has become almost a tradition, the FGN has reneged on the implementation of the re-negotiated agreements. “ASUU-ABSU has to declare unfettered support for ASUU and declared today, Wednesday, 9th February, 2022 as one-day warning strike essentially because the FGN does not honour agreements. “We wish to categorically state that the Federal Government of Nigeria should be held responsible if ASUU embarks on another total, comprehensive and indefinite strike action to press home her demands.” Copyright PUNCH.
