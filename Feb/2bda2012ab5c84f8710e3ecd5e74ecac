The Anambra State Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr C-Don Adinuba, has said the inauguration of the state governor-elect, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, would be done within 20 minutes. Adinuba also stated that the ceremony, which will hold on March 17, would be conducted in front of the Government House, Awka without any fanfare. The commissioner spoke to journalists in Awka on Thursday, while emphasising that the public was not invited to the ceremony as the event would be brief. Adinuba explained that only a few persons with roles to play on that day would be allowed at the ceremony. He said, “The public, traditionally comprising entertainers and the rest, who cannot perform any useful roles, are not expected. Of course, there will be a few family members, party and government officials as well as the media, who will be served with finger foods, table water and beverages under one modest canopy all in front of the Government House, Awka. The entire ceremony will last 20 minutes. “Only the outgoing governor, his wife, the incoming governor, Soludo and Soludo’s wife and a few others will be present at the venue. “Soludo will wear canvas shoes made in Ogbunike; Akwuete clothes with the sleeves rolled up and a pair of jeans to show he is going to work. “Finger foods will be served which Soludo will pay for. He will also pay for media coverage from his pocket. The only thing government will pay for is security, if there is any need.” The commissioner faulted a claim that N500m earmarked for Soludo’s inauguration was mismanaged. Copyright PUNCH.
