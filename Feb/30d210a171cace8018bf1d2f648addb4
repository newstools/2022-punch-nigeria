No fewer than three persons lost their lives when gunmen invaded Nnobi community in the Idemili North Local Government Area and Ekwulobia, in the Aguata LGA of Anambra State. Our correspondent gathered that the gunmen invaded Nnobi community on Monday night and killed two persons near the Roban Stores, close to Nnewi. A source said the hoodlums, who were suspected to be cultists, shot continuously in the air while moving from one location to another. The Anambra State Police Command, in a statement, urged residents of Otolo Nnewi to assist the police with information that could unravel those behind the killing of the victims, whose bodies were dumped along the Abubor Nnewichi Road. In a related development, an official of the Anambra State Traffic Management Agency was killed on Tuesday when gunmen invaded Ekwulobia Junction. Our correspondent gathered that the hoodlums, who invaded the town in two different vehicles, shot the victim while he controlled traffic at the junction. It is, however, not clear if the gunmen were robbers or cultists. As of the time of filing this report, the corpse of the official, whose name was not given, was still on the road. The state police spokesperson, Tochukwu Ikenga, confirmed the incident. He said, “The hoodlums were shooting sporadically at Ekwulobia Junction in a bid to dispossess a mobile police officer. The bullet hit the ATMA official, who was controlling traffic, and killed him. “The police command has instituted a team of officers to apprehend the hoodlums and they are on their trail.” Copyright PUNCH.
