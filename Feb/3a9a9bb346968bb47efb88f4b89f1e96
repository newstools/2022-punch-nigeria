Eight-time NPFL champions Enyimba will be aiming to record their third away win of the season when they face Kwara United at the Ilorin stadium on Wednesday (today). The People’s Elephant defeated Sunshine Stars in their last fixture away from home on February 6. After the win, Enyimba drew 1-1 in their next game at home to Niger Tornadoes, but ahead of the fixture against Kwara United, George Finidi’s side are fifth on the log with 20 points from 12 games and are hoping to find consistency. “We just need to stay consistent by winning regularly,” defender Adekunle Adeleke told PUNCH Sports Extra. “Our aim is to build on the good results we have recorded so far this season.” Kwara United, who are two points adrift of the Elephants, will be aiming to make it three wins from three games against the Elephants. The Ilorin-based outfit also will be gunning for their 11th win over Enyimba in 20 NPFL games. Both teams have recorded 10 wins respectively. Contact:
