Custodian Investment Plc, a non-bank financial institution, has said its gross revenue increased by 14 per cent to N85.5bn in 2021, despite operating in a challenging environment. A statement said the company, which disclosed this in its unaudited result for the year ended December 31, 2021, said after adjusting for non-recurring one-time gain from prior year’s result, profits from continuing ordinary operations recorded 18 per cent growth. The result also showed that the Custodian Group’s shareholders’ fund grew by 14 per cent from N47.6bn to N54.3bn after paying dividends totalling N3.24bn or 55 kobo per share during the year. Speaking on the result, the company’s Group Managing Director, Mr Wole Oshin, said the result could be attributed to the resilience of the group, the diversity of its product offerings, commitment of its staff and the unwavering support of its board of directors. Oshin expressed optimism for a brighter future for the Custodian Group, which has investments in life and non-life insurance, pension fund administration, trusteeship and real estate businesses. He expressed hope that the incremental contribution that will flow in from the group’s real estate business segment, which is being restructured to boost the fortunes of the company. While recognising their contribution, Oshin appreciated the steadfastness of its clients, agents, brokers and all other stakeholders in the insurance, pension, and investment value-chain to the Custodian Group.
