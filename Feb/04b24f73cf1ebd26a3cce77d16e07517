World body FIFA on Thursday cleared Leicester City striker Ademola Lookman to represent Nigeria at senior international level. Lookman was born in Wandsworth, England to Nigerian parents and represented England from U-19 to U-21 levels, winning the FIFA U-20 World Cup with England in 2017. The 24-year-old forward applied to switch his allegiance to the country of his parents’ nationality in October 2021, and was named in Nigeria’s initial 40-man provisional squad for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations but was left out, as FIFA were yet to clear him. FIFA’s Chief Legal and Compliance Officer, Emilio Silveiro, on Thursday conveyed to the Nigeria Football Federation the decision of the Single Judge of the Status Chamber of the Football Tribunal, that their request for a change of association of the Lookman had been accepted. “The request made by the NFF – Nigeria Football Federation for a change of association of the player Ademola Olajide Lookman is accepted. “The player Ademola Olajide Lookman is eligible to play for the representative teams of the Nigeria Football Federation with immediate effect.” Lookman’s switch comes two months after FIFA had also approved the NFF’s application for the switch in allegiance for Ashleigh Plumptre to represent Nigeria internationally. His inclusion in the Eagles has swelled the growing list of footballers born in Europe that have pledged allegiance to Nigeria. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
