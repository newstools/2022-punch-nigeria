Scores of buildings were destroyed in Irese community in the Ifedore Local Government Area of Ondo State on Friday evening by a heavy rainfall. It was gathered that the downpour which started about 7pm and lasted several hours, destroyed property worth millions of naira in the community. According to a source, some of the buildings destroyed by the rainstorm included the community’s health centre, auditorium schools, churches and electric poles, leading to blackouts. Some residents of the community affected by the incident called on the state government and the National Emergency Management Agency to come to their aid, saying the destruction was too much for them to bear. Another source in the community stated that the roofs of over 100 buildings were blown off while fences of some houses fell as a result of the rainstorm. One of the victims, Mr Segun Ajayi, said that his house was affected by the incident. He said, “My house’s roof was removed by the rainstorm. As the roof was removed, the rain entered the house and destroyed some of our personal belongings. We are begging the state government to come to our assistance.” The traditional ruler of the community, Oba Destiny Saka, said the level of the disaster was beyond what the community could bear financially. He also appealed to the state governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, and representatives of the area at the state and national assemblies to assist the victims. He said, “There is a need for quick intervention as the victims have no place to stay.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
