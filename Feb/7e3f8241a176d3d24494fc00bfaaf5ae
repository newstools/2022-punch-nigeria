Nigerian winger Samuel Chukwueze is in line to make his 140th appearance for Villarreal’s first team when they take on Italians Juventus in Tuesday’s (today) UEFA Champions League first leg round of 16 clash at the Estadio de la Ceramica, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Villarreal and Juventus are the only round of 16 opponents never to have met before. Juve drew the Spanish side after topping Group H and would now look to move past the Europa League winners to reach the quarter-finals. Chukwueze joined Villarreal in 2017 from Diamond Academy in Nigeria – two years after he helped the Golden Eaglets lift the U-17 World Cup in Qatar. He made his first-team debut for the Yellow Submarine on April 11, 2018, featuring for 90 minutes in the 1-1 draw at home to Levante. Chukwueze has gone on to make 139 appearances, scoring 22 goals with 19 assists in all competitions for Unai Emery’s side. So far, the 22-year-old has racked up 106 LaLiga appearances, scoring 14 goals and assisting 12 more. Chukwueze, who has played 20 times across all competitions scoring five goals this term, will also be aiming to score his sixth of the season – his second goal in the UEFA Champions League against the Bianconeri, after making three appearances this term. It’s been 125 days since the winger last scored in the competition, when the Yellow Submarines defeated Young Boys 4-1 in Group F on October 20, 2021. Chukwueze scored the fourth goal of the game in the 92nd minute, after just three minutes on the pitch. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
