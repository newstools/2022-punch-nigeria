The Super Falcons landed in Abidjan on Sunday ahead of their 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations second leg qualifier against Ivory Coast, The PUNCH reports. The second leg fixture is scheduled for the Stade Robert Champroux in Abidjan on Wednesday. The Nigeria Football Federation, through its media team, confirmed the arrival of the Falcons in Abidjan. “We’ve landed safely in Abidjan for Wednesday’s second leg match against Ivory Coast,” the media team wrote on Twitter. A brace by US-based forward Ifeoma Onumonu helped the nine-time African champions edge the Lady Elephants 2-0 in the first leg at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja on Friday, to put one leg into the 12th Women’s Africa Cup of Nations finals in Morocco. A draw would see the Falcons book a place at the WAFCON in Morocco, from where Africa’s representatives at next year’s Women’s World Cup would emerge. Meanwhile, captain Asisat Oshoala, who missed out of the first leg fixture due to a hamstring injury, has also been ruled out of the fixture. The team also had their first training on Sunday evening at the Palais des Sports de Treichville in Abidjan.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
