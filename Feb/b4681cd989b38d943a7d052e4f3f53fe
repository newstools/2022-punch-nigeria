Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh, on Sunday lamented over the healthcare system in Nigeria. In her Instagram story, the actress lambasted an undisclosed hospital for refusing to treat an unnamed dying patient. According to her, the hospital demanded a sum of one million naira and she paid N500,000 cash and still gave them a cheque. The mother-of-one further stated that despite her payment, the hospital refused to attend to the patient. She then expressed her exasperation over the attitude of healthcare workers in hospitals. Dikeh wrote, “Our healthcare is ridiculously and painfully zero percent. How can a hospital refuse to treat a dying patient? “You asked for a million, I gave you 500k cash and a cheque, still no one will attend to them. “It’s not like you need to buy anything at the moment. I’m so sick and tired of dealing with these callous healthcare mishaps.” Sharing the screenshot of the story post on her feed, the actress wrote in the caption, “I don’t think I have been this pissed off in a while.” Copyright PUNCH.
