The management of Lagos State University has debunked claims that the institution’s Senate Building was gutted by fire on Wednesday afternoon. The varsity’s Coordinator, Centre for Information Press and Public Relations, Ademola Adekoya, made the clarification in a statement titled, ‘Disregard Video Showing LASU Senate Building on Fire’. Ademola said that contrary to the video clip making the rounds, the Babatunde Raji Fashola Senate Building was in perfect condition with no fire incident recorded. The statement read, “A video making the rounds ostensibly showing Babatunde Raji Fashola Senate Building of the University on fire has been brought to our attention. “We wish to state clearly that the video is fake and totally unfounded. We regard this as nothing but the handiwork of some unscrupulous fellows with wild and vile imaginations seeking to create unnecessary tension in the minds of members of the University Community and the general public. “We, therefore, advise that the video should be disregarded in its entirely and should not be validated any further by being shared/forwarded to others.” The institution’s clarification followed reports (not by The PUNCH) that the Senate building recently inaugurated by the State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, reportedly caught fire.
