A bomb planted by terrorists in the Galadima Kogo community of Niger State has killed four security personnel and several yet-to-be-identified civilians. The terrorists were said to have earlier attacked Gpekure, Makuba and Galapai communities in the Shiroro Local Government, killed eight persons on Sunday and kidnapped 13 others before they planted Improvised Explosive Devices in the area on Monday morning. The State Commissioner of Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Internal Security, Emmanuel Umar, confirmed the attacks in a phone interview with The PUNCH. “Both unfortunate attacks happened and unfortunately we lost some of our men and a number of yet-to-be-identified civilian casualties. “We lost four of our security personnel who were in our security vehicle that ran on the bomb,” he said. “I and other security agencies are yet to get to the point where the explosion took place because we are waiting for the bomb experts to inform us of the safety of the areas before we can go there,” Umar stated.
