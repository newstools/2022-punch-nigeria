Operatives of the Nigeria Immigration Service, Ekiti State Command, have rescued eight children being trafficked from Benue to Lagos and Oyo states through Ekiti State. The NIS Comptroller, Ekiti State Command, Mr Alphonsus Achilonu, said a suspect was also arrested for his alleged involvement in child labour. Achilonu, who spoke in Ado Ekiti during a week-long customer service ceremony, said, “The NIS Anti-Human Trafficking Squad, acting on a tip-off and through intelligence gathering, arrested one man while trafficking the eight children, who are minors, to their end-users in Lagos and Ibadan, Oyo State. He confessed that he brought the children from Benue State. “The eight victims have been reunited with their families. Many people are in the business. They have to be checked at all costs and the best approach is for the government, parents and well-meaning Nigerians to ensure that they are sincere with the provision of basic needs for these children, put them in schools, create an enabling environment and jobs for them.”  Copyright PUNCH.
