The National Youth Service Corps on Friday unveiled the enrolment of corps members into the National Health Insurance Scheme under the NYSC Group Individual Family Social Health Insurance Programme. The organisation said the health initiative had been designed as a holistic health insurance scheme, covering the periods of pre-orientation. The NYSC said six Health Maintenance Organisations had been selected from each of the six geopolitical zones to drive the process and ensure effective implementation of the NHIS. The NYSC urged corps members to register under Health Care Practitioners in their localities. The Director – General of the NYSC, Major General Shuaibu Ibrahim, during the event, said the health scheme was the culmination of the presidential directive issued in 2016, which arose as a result of the unfortunate deaths of three corps members deployed to Kano, Zamfara and Bayelsa States orientation camps. He said the loss of any corps member provoked sadness in the NYSC, saying it leaves the scheme “highly diminished.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
