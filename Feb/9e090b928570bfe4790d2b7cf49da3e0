Akwa Ibom State High Court sitting in Uyo, the state capital, has sentenced one Ita Sampson to three years’ imprisonment for impersonation. The convict, a native of Odot in the Nsit- Atai Local Government Area of the state, who claimed to be a staff member of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on July 29, 2010, connived with a police corporal from Cross River State. Both men presented themselves as EFCC and Department of State Services officers respectively, pretending to be investigating a petition from Abuja against the First Bank Manager, Etinan branch, Mr Godwin Daniel. Delivering judgment on Thursday, the trial judge, Justice Okon Okon, held that Sampson was guilty of impersonation of a public officer. The judge described the convict as “a miserable liar and a serial fraudster, that nemesis has caught up with,” adding that he “did not show remorse, but made efforts to cajole the court through his fairly tale of defence.” He further held that Sampson was not a decent member of the society and constituted a danger to public safety. Justice Okon said the convict should be kept away from public glare for sometime in the hope that he would learn his lessons and turn a new leaf. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
