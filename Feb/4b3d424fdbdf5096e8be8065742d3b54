THE courage and energy of the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi make him the preferred candidate to clinch the Presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress ahead of the 2023 election, a former governorship candidate in Rivers State, Tonye Princewill has stated. Speaking during an interactive meeting with select journalists in Port Harcourt on Saturday, Princewill said it would take a politician of Amaechi’s pedigree  to  to tackle the myriads of problems confronting the nation. He further said the former Rivers State Governor is the only credible person that has what it takes to move the country to the next level. Princewill noted that if performance and the knowledge of Nigeria’s politics were criteria to determine who should be the country’s President in 2023, “then the cap fits Rotimi Amaechi.” He said that the wealth of experience Amaechi has gathered over the years as two-time speaker, chairman of the Speakers Forum;  two-term governor; chairman of Nigerian Governors Forum; ‘’Director-General who sacked a sitting President and the best performing minister makes him the best man for the job.” Princewill noted that though Amaechi may be stubborn, “he is very stubborn for results. He does not take ‘no’ for an answer. He goes for results and he has always gotten results in anything he sets his eyes on. He added, “Amaechi took over the moribund railway industry and transformed it to something that we all can be proud of as a people. He may not remember friendship when he becomes President because he needs results that would make Nigerians happy. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
