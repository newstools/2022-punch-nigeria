A man, identified as Erekeere Daniel, has been arrested for allegedly raping the 20-year-old daughter of his neighbour in Luegbo Beeri community in the Khana Local Government Area of Rivers State. A source in the community said the suspect and father of two, who has since been arrested detained at the Bori Police Division, broke into the home of his female neighbour while she was away, on the pretence of looking for a wheelbarrow to hire, and raped her daughter. It was gathered that the suspect pounced on his victim who was asleep and stripped her naked before raping her. Other neighbours were said to have been alerted by the victim’s cry for help before Daniel was arrested. But when contacted, the acting spokesperson of the Rivers State Police Command, Grace Koko, said she had yet to be briefed about the incident.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
