The Commander General of the Harmonised Vigilante Group, Ridwan Hussein, has urged the Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, to intervene and end killings and other criminal activities in Ede town. Ede town has come under series of attacks lately, which have resulted in loss of lives and destruction of property. One Rasidi Oko’lu has, however, been declared wanted by the police in connection with killings in the town. Speaking to newsmen in Ede, on Saturday, Hussein, also known as Yah Salam, decried the activities of criminals in the community, and advised that all stakeholders must unite to prevent escalation. Hussein, who noted that members of his group were not involved in the criminal acts, said those behind the current mayhem must be apprehended and dealt with. “I also support the suggestion made by our father, Kabiyesi, Timi of Ede, that government at both local and state levels in Osun State should call for an urgent security meeting in Ede in collaboration with other relevant stakeholders. “If this will bring back sanity to our community, I am in support of it one hundred per cent. “We must do everything possible to curb this act of lawlessness in Ede land. Perpetrators must be arrested and brought to justice with immediate effect. “It is high time we stopped the mayhem in Ede land. It is high time we said no to cultism in Ede land. It is high time we said no to gangsterism In Ede land. It is high time we embraced peace in Ede land. “It is high time we waged total war on the Area Boys and hoodlums disturbing the peace of Ede, our beautiful heritage, the peaceful home of the legendary Timi Olofa Ina. I totally condemn the present state of lawlessness in Ede and its environs,” he said.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
