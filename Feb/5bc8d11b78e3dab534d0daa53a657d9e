The Lagos State Ministry of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation in conjunction with the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Resurrection Parish, has organised a four-week short term vocational skills acquisition for women and youths in the state. The Commissioner for Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Mrs Bolaji Dada, according to a statement on Wednesday, disclosed this during an event held at the RCCG parish in Lekki. She said, “This training ran simultaneously in five selected centres across the state and is expected to benefit no fewer than 1,500 participants in the first quarter of year 2022 and it will serve as part of the state government’s poverty reduction strategy in its renewed effort to empower vulnerable women in the state with vocations that will help them to be economically independent. “Our objective is to train women, youths and men alike in various skills and vocations for the purpose of economic empowerment and lift their status from the state of dependency to self-reliance. The past beneficiaries of our short term vocational training are now contributing to their family and societal development.” A Senior Pastor, RCCG Resurrection Parish, Lekki, Mrs Bola Kpandei, lauded the state government for its unwavering commitment to easing the plights of women and curbing the menace of youth restiveness across the state. “This initiative by WAPA is very commendable and today marks the beginning of greater things to come, so be the best you can be and believe that God Almighty will lead your steps,” she said.
