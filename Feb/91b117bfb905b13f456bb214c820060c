A non-governmental organisation under the aegis of TechHer has commenced the school tour project for 700 students drawn from 10 secondary schools in Abuja, Nigeria, in the area of digital literacy. The training in partnership with the Commonwealth of Learning will continue the organisation’s previous work as part of its digital literacy program targeting mainly women and girls. A statement issued on Thursday by the Program Officer, Soniya Dawarga, said the current project phase sought to create partnerships, build volunteer networks, digital literacy clubs, and develop a digital literacy training curriculum for secondary schools in Nigeria. According to her, the project will be implemented across selected schools, pre-approved by the Universal Basic Education Board with the specific goal of exposing the students to basic digital literacy skills, career opportunities in technology, and online safety. Dawarga said, “TechHer is keen to create digital literate communities, especially among disadvantaged communities, including women and youth groups. We are focusing on schools in peri-urban areas of Abuja.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
