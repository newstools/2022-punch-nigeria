Suspected killers of Senator Bala Na’Allah’s son, Abdulkarim,were on Thursday arraigned before a Kaduna State High Court. The three suspects are Bashir Mohammed, Nasiru Balarabe, and Suleiman Salisu. They were being charged for criminal conspiracy, robbery, and culpable homicide before the court presided over by Justice Amina Bello. Kaduna State Solicitor-General and the lead Prosecution Counsel, Dari Bayero, asked the court to discontinue the case from being mentioned as the first and second defendants were not represented by any counsel at the court. Bayero told journalists shortly after court sitting that the first and second defendants must be represented by counsel(s) for fair hearing. But counsel for the third defendant, Avong Emmanuel, sought for the bail of his client on the ground of health challenges. However, the court did not grant the bail application of the third defendant. Abdulkarim, a pilot, was killed in August at his Malali residence in Kaduna. The suspects were said to have forcefully gained access into the resident of the deceased at Umar Gwandu Road Malali, a highbrow area in the state, killed him and made away his Lexus SUV to an unknown destination. Meanwhile, the court has fixed March 21, 2022 for proper arraignment of the three suspects. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
