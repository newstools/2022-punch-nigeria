Sports and digital entertainment firm, BetKing, has delighted two of its customers with brand new SUVs as part of its just-concluded AFKON campaign. The campaign, tagged #ThatAFKONFeeling, was unveiled in January as part of the firm’s efforts to celebrate African football and reward BetKing customers during the African Cup of Nations. The winners of the cars, according to a statement on Tuesday, are Joseph Ezugwu from Anambra State and Ugochukwu Nwagbo from Edo State. The Head of BTL Marketing, Kingmakers, Oludare Kafar, said, “It has been an exciting past few weeks and we are glad to wrap up the AFKON campaign in grand style as we reward two of some of our winners with brand new car prizes. At BetKing, we are deeply committed to celebrating African football and rewarding our customers, hence, we look forward to future initiatives such as this. “As you can see, for this campaign, there is still one more brand new SUV available to be won, and we are on the search for the winner. We urge our customers to partake in this very promo to stand a chance to win the third JAC SUV.”
