The Supreme Court on Friday declared that the Executive Order 10 on the funding of State Judiciary and Legislature is unlawful and unconstitutional. The majority of a seven-member panel of the court agreed that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), exceeded his constitutional powers in issuing the EO10.

The court also dismissed the N66 billion suit filed by state governors against the Federal Government. Details later… Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
