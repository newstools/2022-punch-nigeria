Former Big Brother Naija Shine Ya Eye housemate, Angel, has expressed her disbelief over BBNaija fans who tried to convince her that she was ugly. She made this known in a tweet on Saturday night where she noted that the thought made her feel dizzy. “I can’t believe bbhen (sic) fans tried to convince me that I was ugly. Me? Best in beauty?” Angel questioned. She went on to list all the brands she worked with, adding, “I’ll come back to add to this when I announce other deals.” In her next tweet, the 21-year-old writer said, “My theory of life is that you cannot suddenly hate someone you claimed to love. I don’t think it’s that easy to stop loving someone, especially without good reason. “You might not care for them again but I don’t think you ever truly stop loving them. Of course this doesn’t apply if they commit serious crimes against you; like rape, sexual assault, physical violence, etc. but like minor fall outs and then they become your worst enemy?Just sounds like their true feelings came out. “And I’m also a firm believer that because the friendship/relationship didn’t work out, it’s not an excuse to drag the other person through the mud(if it ended relatively okay) because how are you comfortably speaking ill of someone that you once loved/liked?” Copyright PUNCH.
