As part of activities to mark this year’s Valentine’s Day celebration, Dufil Prima Foods, makers of Indomie instant noodles, has donated several cartons of its product to three orphanages in Lagos. The Nigerian Red Cross Motherless & Abandoned Babies Home, Heritage Homes Orphanage and Love Home Orphanage were the beneficiaries. The company’s Group Corporate Communications & Events Manager, Tope Ashiwaju, said the gesture extended love to children in orphanages. Ashiwaju said, “Valentine is a period of sharing love and giving to those who may be unable to reciprocate the gesture. To children, Indomie is not just a meal, it represents a symbol of the love their parents have for them and an incentive that spurs them to do well in many areas of their lives.” “We are here to extend love to these beautiful children because we love them and we believe in them. The future parents, teachers, accountants, lawyers, governors, pastors, imams, and senators are here. Seeing the genuine smiles and joy on the faces of these kids on account of their love for the Indomie brand is quite humbling and is all the gratification we need to do more. ”
