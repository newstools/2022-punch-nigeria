Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State has distributed essential drugs worth N1.6 billion to various hospitals in the state. The drugs, which would be given to patients free of charge, were donated to the state by an NGO based in America called ‘Map International’. Speaking during the distribution exercise of the drugs, Governor Matawalle said, it was part of the NGO’s earlier promise to the state last year. Matawalle said, “The donation of the drugs was part of the NGO’s earlier promise to the state government when I visited the United States of America last year.” Matawalle said the gesture was part of his administration’s polity of promoting health care of the people of the state. “As you are all aware, my administration attaches priority attention to the issue of health care delivery. “We have taken decisive steps since May 2019 to revamp the health sector to meet the healthcare needs of our growing population, the majority of whom fall into the less privileged category.” He said his administration has established the Zamfara State Contributory Healthcare Management Agency aimed at ensuring broader health coverage. Other achievements, according to Matawalle, are the launching of a programme named “Care for 34,000 Vulnerable Persons” under the Basic Healthcare Provision Fund in November 2021 and the supply of ambulances to General Hospitals. Matawalle also explained that his Government has provided rickshaw ambulances to all the 147 newly constructed primary healthcare centres and constructed an infectious diseases hospital at Damba area, Gusau.
