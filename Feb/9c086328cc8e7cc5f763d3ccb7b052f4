The Akwa Ibom State governor’s wife, Dr Martha Emmanuel, has urged the police to refrain from harassing and demanding money from victims of Gender Based Violence before their cases are addressed. She said such attitude has scared away other victims of GBV from speaking out and going to the police station to lodge their complaints to the police which ought to be the first point of call. Martha stated this when she led members of Gender Based Violence Management Committee on a courtesy visit to the state Commissioner of Police, Andrew Amiengheme, on Friday. She expressed disappointment, adding that demanding from victims who were already wounded and traumatised was an act of insensitivity. Emmanuel told the commissioner that the essence of the courtesy visit was to seek partnership with the police on how to tackle GBV issues in the state even as she acknowledged the efforts and support of some police officers so far in addressing the menace. She said, “We are here on a courtesy visit on behalf of gender based violence management committee, Akwa Ibom State, to look into cases of GBV in the state which you have been very supportive of.  We’ve been fighting this menace over the years now, especially cases of rape that have been on the high side. So far, the police most time have cooperated with us. “We are here to officially tell you that we want to work with you and we want you to work with us. I’m saying this because there are some police stations in some local governments that are not friendly. I want you sir to have a meeting with them and address this issue.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
