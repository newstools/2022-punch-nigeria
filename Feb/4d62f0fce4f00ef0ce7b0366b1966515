Nollywood actor, Lateef Adedimeji, on Sunday, celebrated his mother on the latter’s birthday. Sharing a picture of his mother on his Instagram page, the actor promised to celebrate her all the days of his life. Calling her “blessed” among women, the actor also showed his mother with prayers. He wrote, “Today is your birthday mummy but I’ll celebrate you every day of my life, not only because it is the will of the holy books but also because you deserve it. “For the days my prayers are too weak and God decides to listen to yours; for the selflessness and the days you bore pains for me to smile; “For the nine months you sheltered me from the arrows of the day and the terrors of the night; for my years on your back even though in a way I still live there, I celebrate you today on your birthday and I wish you more strength to live long in fullness of health to enjoy the fruits of your hard labour. “This is my prayer for you mummy, may your teeth be strong to bite the meals and may your heart be tuned to God constantly for the peace that matters. “You’re blessed among women. Insha Allah, I’ll be here to wish you again next year and many more to come. Happy birthday, lya lati mi owon.” The actor, who recently marked his birthday, was also celebrated by his actress wife, Adebimpe.
