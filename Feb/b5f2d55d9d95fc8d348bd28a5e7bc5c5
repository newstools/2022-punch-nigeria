A national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on Sunday visited the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, to seek support and for his ambition to succeed the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari, (retd.), in 2023. The former Lagos State Governor’s visit to the traditional ruler was in continuation of his consultation which had taken him to some prominent monarchs. A crowd of residents went to welcome him where his helicopter landed with many of them hailing him and wishing him success on his efforts to rule the country. A horde of his supporters who came with him from Lagos thronged the palace and sang intermittently as he told the traditional ruler the purpose of his visit. “All I came for today is to seek your blessing, your cooperation, your prayer for me to become the President of Federal Republic of Nigeria,” Tinubu told the monarch. The Alaafin prayed for Tinubu to succeed in his effort. He said he was confident that Yoruba ancestors would support him to become the President. Some Tinubu’s supporters, led by Senator Dayo Adeyeye, had visited the monarch in December 2021 to solicit support for him.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
