The face-off between the Executive Secretary of the National Board for Technical Education, Prof. Idris Bugaje and the Acting Rector of the Kaduna Polytechnic, Dr Suleiman Umar, over the appointment of substantive rector for the institution, is far from being over. Trouble started when the Governing Council of the Kaduna Polytechnic, led by 90-year-old Mohammed Mohammed on November 17, 2021, approved the extension of another six months for The Rector, Dr Suleiman Umar to serve in an acting capacity. This, the NBTE boss kicked against because it violated the Polytechnic (Amendment) Act 2019 which forbade such extension. “In the case of vacancy in the office of the Rector, the Council shall appoint an Acting Rector who should not be in office for more than six months,” a copy of the Polytechnic Act obtained by our correspondent read. Against this background, Mohammed Abdullahi, a stakeholder in the Polytechnic sector, had written the Minister of Education, Dr Adamu Adamu, to wade into the matter with a view to resolving it. He also alleged that Bugaje opposed the appointment of Umar as the substantive Rector of Kaduna Polytechnic because he had a case to answer with the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission.
