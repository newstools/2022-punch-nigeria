Bendel Insurance FC of Benin on Tuesday unveiled a N50m sponsorship deal with Sterling Bank for the 2021/22 season. The sponsorship deal, saw the Benin Arsenal showcase the bank crested jersey at a colorful event at the Edo State Government House, Benin City. Speaking at the ceremony, CEO, Sterling Bank, Asue Ighodalo, said the deal was an investment opportunity for the bank, which sees Edo State as a development partner. He thanked the Edo State Government for the opportunity to invest in the famous club and stated the bank’s commitment to the deal. “We see ourselves committed as true partners with Edo State, not because I am the chairman of the bank or that I am from Edo State, but because we understand the development philosophy of the state. That is why we are committed to the state and it makes investment sense for us at Sterling Bank to invest in the state.” Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki thanked the bank for investing in the club, adding that his administration knew the potential sports had in developing the youths. “For us in Edo State, it is a step further to invite the private sector into sports in the state. The problem we have in sports today in Nigeria is that we are not getting corporate Nigerians to take their brand and support our local teams, so, what Sterling Bank has done will go a long way.” Copyright PUNCH.
