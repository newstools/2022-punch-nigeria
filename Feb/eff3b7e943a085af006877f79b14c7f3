Leicester advance, Celtic crash out of Europa Conference League Leicester eased into the last 16 of the Europa Conference League with a 3-1 win over Danish side Randers as Celtic crashed out to Norwegian champions Bodo Glimt on Thursday. Already leading 4-1 from the first leg last week, Leicester were never in danger once Harvey Barnes opened the scoring after just two minutes. James Maddison added two more in a four-minute spell in the second half before Stephen Odey secured a consolation. Celtic were convincingly dumped out 5-1 on aggregate as Bodo dominated in a 2-0 win in Arctic conditions. Visiting manager Ange Postecoglou hinted he believed the tie may have already been lost in Glasgow last week as he made a much-changed side with a series of key players left out. Bodo took full advantage in a blistering opening as Ola Solbakken opened the scoring after just nine minutes. Hugo Vetlesen then calmly steered home a second 21 minutes from time at the end of a well-worked move to keep alive the European dreams of a side from a town with a population of just 50,000. Marseille eased past Qarabag 3-0 in Baku to complete a 6-1 aggregate win thanks to goals from Pape Gueye, Matteo Guendouzi and Konrad de la Fuente. PSV Eindhoven squeezed past Maccabi Tel Aviv 2-1 on aggregate after a 1-1 draw in Israel, while Partizan Belgrade beat Sparta Prague 2-1 on the night to progress 3-1 overall. AFP
