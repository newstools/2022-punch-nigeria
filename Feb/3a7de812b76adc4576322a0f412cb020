Cholera outbreaks claimed no fewer than 175 lives across the 23 Local Government Areas of Kaduna State last year, the state Commissioner of Health, Dr. Amina Muhammed-Baloni, has said. The Commissioner disclosed this while receiving cholera testing equipment donated by the World Health Organisation to the state in Kaduna on Thursday. The items donated are meant for the Zonal Cholera Laboratory located at the Late Yusuf Dantsofo Memorial Hospital, Tudun-Wada in the state capital. Speaking to journalists shortly after receiving the donation, the Commissioner said the state witnessed huge cases of cholera outbreaks in 2021, putting the casualty figures recorded across the state at 175. According to the commissioner, almost all the 23 local government areas in the state were hit by the disease, adding the donation by the world health body will go a long way to enhance the containment of the disease in the state. The Commissioner, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Adamu Mohammed-Mansir, said, “As far the issue of cholera was concerned in 2021, virtually all the local government areas had cases of cholera and casualties. “So this effort by the World Health Organization, concern about the health matters around the world, came at the right time because this will enhance our capability to not only do the rapid diagnostic test but also to know the type of cholera in the state. So, we thank WHO for its support to Kaduna State. “We recorded some deaths from the cholera epidemics. 175 people died from the disease in the state.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
