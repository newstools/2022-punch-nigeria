The Federal High Court in Abeokuta, Ogun State on Friday upheld the suspension of a factional chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state, Samson Bamgbose, and five others. The court also awarded N10m damages against Bamgbose while N2m was awarded against each of the five others. Bamgbose and five others were on November 9, 2020 suspended as members of the Ogun State PDP Working Committee and Executive Committee over alleged anti-party activities. They were suspended shortly after the death of the late Senator Buruji Kashamu, who represented Ogun East in the state before his death. Displeased with their suspension, Bamgbose and the five others had headed to court to challenge the action. Joined as defendants in the suit were the PDP, the Independent National Electoral Commission, Inspector-General of Police and three other members of the PDP, seeking to have their suspension upturned. Opposing the suit, counsel for the defendants, Ifeoma Esom, argued that the court lack jurisdiction to entertain the suit because the subject matter was an internal party affair. The defence counsel prayed the court to dismiss the suit. In her verdict on Friday, Justice Joyce Abdulmalik agreed with Esom and accordingly dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction. The judge, who upheld the plaintiffs’ suspension, restrained Bamgbose from parading himself as the chairman of PDP in Ogun State. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
