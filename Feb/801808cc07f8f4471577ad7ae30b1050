Falconets head coach, Christopher Danjuma, says the team has no choice but to go out for goals when they face their Cameroonian counterpart in the 2022 U-20 Women’s World Cup in Costa Rica qualifiers at the refurbished MKO Abiola National Stadium, Abuja on Saturday (today). Both sides played out a goalless draw in their first leg meeting on January 22 at the Stade Reunification in Douala. Nigeria will need a win to see them through to the playoff round of the qualifiers where they’ll face the winner between Morocco and Senegal for a place in the finals billed for August 10 to 28 in Costa Rica. Speaking ahead of the game, Danjuma says they will be hoping to get enough goals to see them through to the next qualifying round. “We have no choice but to go all out for goals. The Cameroonian team is a strong one but we have worked hard since returning from the first leg in Douala and I believe my girls will get the job done,” Danjuma told TheNFF.com. Saturday’s encounter will be the first international match at the MKO Abiola National Stadium since the venue hosted a 2016 Women Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match between the Super Falcons and the Senior Women Team of Senegal in April 2016. The Confederation of African Football has appointed Togolese official Vincentia Amedome as the centre referee. Amedome will be assisted by compatriot Abra Agbedanou (assistant referee 1); Ghanaian Doris Essuman Darko (assistant referee II) and yet another Togolese Edoh Kindedji (fourth official). The match commissioner is Aisha Nalule from Uganda while Ghanaian Emmanuella Grace Aglago will serve as referee assessor.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
