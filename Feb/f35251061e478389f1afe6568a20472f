The Federal Government has urged mining operators to practice responsible mining across the country. The Minister of State Mines and Steel Development, Dr. Uchechukwu Ogah, said this during a facility tour of BUA Cement, Okpella, Edo State. This was contained in a press statement from the ministry titled, ‘Mining: FG tasks operators on responsible mining’, which was issued on Monday. The statement read in part, “The Federal Government in demonstrating its commitment towards ensuring increased revenue in the mineral sector has tasked operators in the country to carry out responsible mining for the benefit of all.” The minister encouraged miners to operate within mining extant laws, which would promote peace between them and host communities. It added, “According to him, operating within mining extant laws would engender peaceful coexistence between operators and host communities. He encouraged them to maintain a good community relationship for enhanced production, stating that maximum production of the plant would be of immense benefit to the Federal Government and create jobs for lots of Nigerians.” Copyright PUNCH.
