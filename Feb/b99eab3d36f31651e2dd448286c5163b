The Peoples Democratic Party Governors’ Forum has described as a naked and unconstitutional abuse of power Tuesday’s impeachment of the Zamfara State Deputy Governor, Mahdi Gusau, by the State House of Assembly. This is as it argued that the entire Zamfara House of Assembly defected from the PDP to the APC without any form of division in the opposition party in the state and therefore should lose their seats as required by the constitution. The forum’s position was revealed via a statement signed on Friday by its Director-General, C.I.D Maduabum, titled ‘Zamfara: an immoral, illegal and unfortunate impeachment’. On Tuesday, February 22, 2022, The PUNCH had reported that the now former deputy governor of the north-western state was impeached during plenary shortly after the House received the report of the committee set up by the Chief Judge of the state, Justice Kulu Aliyu, to investigate the allegations against him. The PDP-GF said, “It is immoral, perfidious and an affront to the rule of law for an illegally constituted House of Assembly to purport to oust a validly elected deputy governor just because he towed the oath of honour and followed his oath of office by remaining faithful to those that elected him as a PDP member. “It should be noted that the entire Zamfara House of Assembly decamped from PDP to APC without any form of division in PDP and therefore should lose their seats as required by the Constitution.”  Copyright PUNCH.
