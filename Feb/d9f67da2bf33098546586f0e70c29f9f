Popular Nigerian gospel artiste, Tim Godfrey, on Wednesday announced his engagement to his beau on his Instagram page. Sharing pictures from the moment, the Nara crooner wrote, “Meeting you changed my life. Meeting you brought unending smiles. Most importantly, meeting you was and is my greatest reward from God. “Thank you for saying YES! I can’t imagine how I’ve lived without you all my life. But guess what? I would have waited forever till we crossed paths. But thank God, this blissful and Heaven-made journey has started. “After giving my life to Christ, sharing life with you is the best thing that has happened to me. No measure of time with you will be enough but let’s start with forever. “‘EKJ’ You are my STILL WATERS! I love you.” The singer, however, did not reveal the identity of his fiancee, as he neither mentioned her name nor tagged her to the post. Her face was also concealed in the pictures shared by the singer on his page. See pictures of the engagement below:  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
