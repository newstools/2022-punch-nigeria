The apex socio-cultural organisation in Igboland, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, on Monday urged other zones of the country to support a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction in 2023. The group’s President-General, Prof George Obiozor, who spoke in Owerri, Imo state, said that “wherever the country picks its President from in 2023 will send a strong message to Ndigbo.” Asked whether Igbo are campaigning enough across the country, Obiozor said since 1960, Igbo have been campaigning for their rights to leadership in Nigeria. He said, “So anybody who says that we have not campaigned enough about the 2023 Igbo President is guilty of historical fallacy because many of us know how often those rights and opportunities have been denied or ignored with impunity. “How can one be accused of making noise over marginalisation or discrimination in critical areas of Nigerian politics and at the same time accused of not making enough political campaign for the 2023 Presidency? “Ndigbo have campaigned for any relevant national political office since the end of the war. “Most Nigerians with conscience and friends of Nigeria inside and outside the country know this to be the truth.” He said a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction in 2023 will unite the country and restore national hope.
