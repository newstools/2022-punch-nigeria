Former vice president Atiku Abubakar has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission to roll out election guidelines ahead of the 2023 general elections. According to him, this will enable political parties to commence the process of choosing their leaders in 2023. Atiku said this following the signing into law of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2022 by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Friday. He tweeted, “Now that the legal framework for the 2023 elections is in place following President Muhammadu Buhari’s assent to the Electoral Bill, @inecnigeria needs to roll out the election guidelines in earnest so that the political parties and Nigerians can fully commence the journey to choose their leaders in 2023. “I wish to acknowledge the work of the legislature in bringing this law with innovations into fruition. I also pay tribute to the nudge of civil society and patriotic Nigerians in making this brand new Electoral Act a reality.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
