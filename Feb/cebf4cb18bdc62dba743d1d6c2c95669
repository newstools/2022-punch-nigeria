The Independent National Electoral Commission has redeployed 186 staff ahead of the 2023 elections. Among the affected officials were 46 Heads of Departments
either serving in their states of origin or have served for between 10 and 32 years in the same state. INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said this in a statement on Thursday in Abuja. According to him, the exercise was to ensure efficient and optimal performance. Okoye described the situation where some officials are found serving in their states of origin as unhealthy for the sensitive responsibilities they discharge. He said, “In line with the commission’s existing posting policy, henceforth no Head of Department or Electoral Officer shall serve in his/her state of origin. Furthermore, no staff shall serve for more than two electoral cycles in the same duty post. “Consequently, the commission has identified 186 staff for immediate redeployment. Among them are 46 HoDs who are either serving in their States of origin or served for more than two electoral cycles in the same State as well as 140 EOs serving in their States of origin or served for more than two electoral cycles in the same State. “The redeployed staff are to complete the handing and taking over not later than Wednesday March 9, 2022. “This will be an ongoing exercise that will extend to other categories of staff in the Commission’s headquarters, state and local government offices nationwide.” Copyright PUNCH.
