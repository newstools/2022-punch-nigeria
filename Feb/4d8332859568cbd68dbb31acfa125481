Nollywood actor and comedian, Williams Uchemba, has shown gratitude to his wife, Brunella, on the delivery of his first child, by gifting her a new car. The actor had announced the birth of their daughter, Chikamara Isabella Uchemba on Sunday, with a video posted via Instagram. On Tuesday, Uchemba took to Instagram to appreciate his wife for “all the stress” that came with the pregnancy journey. He said, “A little push gift for all the stress you went through these past nine months trying to bring @kamarauchemba into the world. “From the sleepless nights to the back pains, and how standing up became your favourite sleeping position. Thank you for making me a father to the most beautiful baby I’ve set my eyes on. You are indeed a superwoman and your strength can’t be matched. I LOVE YOU,” he wrote in the caption. The Merry Men actor also gave a shout-out to all “awaiting mothers and mothers out there.” “You guys are the real MVP,” he wrote. The couple tied the knot in a star-studded ceremony in November 2020.
