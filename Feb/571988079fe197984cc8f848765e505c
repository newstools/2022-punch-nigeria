The National Emergency Management Agency has concluded the distribution of relief materials to victims of disasters in impacted communities in the Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. The disasters that occurred in the area in 2021 included ocean surge, windstorms and flooding, which destroyed property and farmlands as well as displaced many residents. Items distributed to the victims included rice, beans, garri, vegetable oil, tin tomatoes, seasoning, salt, mattresses, mosquito nets and blankets, among others. NEMA carried out the exercise under its post-disaster assistance, which was facilitated by the member representing the Southern Ijaw Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Preye Oseke. Speaking in Yenagoa on Saturday, NEMA’s Head of Operations, Edo State, Dahiru Yusuf, said the distribution was carried out after an assessment of the affected communities. He stated that the federal legislator had forwarded a letter to the agency about the catastrophes and the need for his constituents to be assisted with relief materials. Yusuf said, “It is assistance from the Federal Government to flood victims of 2021 from Southern Ijaw communities. “There are communities in that area that were seriously affected; we heard of it and we went for an assessment. Most of them lost food items. So, this is assistance from the Federal Government to cushion what they have lost to the flooding.” The NEMA official, therefore, urged the beneficiaries to use the relief materials judiciously. The lawmaker’s wife, Bridget Oseke, commended the Federal Government and her husband for reaching out to the people. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
