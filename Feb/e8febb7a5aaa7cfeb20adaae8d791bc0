Pelumi Olajengbesi, a former member of the legal team of embattled Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, alias Sunday Igboho, has said the agitator will be released ‘very soon’ from Beninese prison where he is currently being detained. The lawyer said this in a terse post on his Facebook page on Saturday, stating that there would be massive jubilation in Yorubaland because Igboho ‘is no doubt a courageous man’. “Chief Sunday Igboho will be out very soon and there will be massive jubilation across the entire Yorubaland. He is no doubt a courageous man. This is very authoritative, just that our Yoruba leaders should stop being selfish and allow good to prevail,” his post read. But Igboho’s lead counsel, Chief Yomi Aliyu (SAN), told one of our correspondents that he had no idea where Olajengbesi got his information from. Aliyu accused the lawyers hired for Igboho in Cotonou of not doing enough. Sunday PUNCH reports that that Igboho has spent over 200 days in Benin Republic detention since he was arrested at Cotonou airport en route to Germany alongside his wife in July 2020. Aliyu said,, “I don’t know where he got the information from. Lawyers in Cotonou have always been promising us every weekend that Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a Igboho Oosa, would be released coming week. “They even make videos in their offices posting same online! But ask them whether there is any process before the court to that effect or any judgment in waiting then they will shyly refer you to a letter to a minister from Chief Sunday’s doctor! “Olajengbesi could have fallen for these antics from those videos made by Beninoise lawyers; he not being Chief Sunday Adeyemo, a.k.a Igboho Oosa’s counsel.” Copyright PUNCH.
