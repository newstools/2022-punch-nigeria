Churchill Olakunle, the ex-husband of Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh, has penned romantic words to his wife, Rosy Meurer. The businessman who married the Gambia-born actress shortly after his divorce from Tonto Dikeh wrote on his Instagram page, “Love is beautiful, I know that for a fact. You have shown me the sweetest part of your love and the only thing I am sure about is being with you. I’m proud to be loved by you. “Sometimes, I think about what would have happened if I never met you. Only you made my world very meaningful, you are a rare gift. Happy Valentine my wife @official_rosymeurer.” Churchill displayed pictures of his wife on his social media page. However, Rosy Meurer has not posted any messages on her official Instagram handle since Sunday. It was earlier reported by The PUNCH that the couple celebrated their second anniversary recently. They adorned traditional attire on Instagram. Meurer, who thanked her husband for loving her, said she was a “complete woman” with him. “Knowing and marrying you have brought nothing but joy, peace, and satisfaction to me. There are so many beautiful things to say to you but most of all I want to say thank you for loving me. Happy anniversary baby. Cheers to many more years together, I love you,” she had said.
