Thomas Tuchel has tested positive for Covid-19, the club announced on its website on Saturdy. The Chelsea head coach will now follow necessary self-isolation protocols and hopes to join up with the team in Abu Dhabi later next week. The team fly out for the Club World Cup following this afternoon’s FA Cup clash with Plymouth Argyle. Assistant coach Arno Michels spoke to the media before-kick and revealed that he would be in close communication with the boss. “He was fully in charge throughout the whole week with the preparation for the game so he knows exactly what’s going on today,” he said. “We will stay in touch with him during the game as well so it’s all good.” Copyright PUNCH.
