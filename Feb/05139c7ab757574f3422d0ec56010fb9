American fitness model, Maralee Nichols, has revealed that basketball star, Tristan Thompson, “has done nothing” to support their two-month-old son. Nichols’s publicist made this known in a statement to Page Six on Monday night, following a report that claimed Thompson could be paying $40,000 child support to each of his baby mamas: Khloé Kardashian, Jordan Craig and Nichols. The statement, however, revealed that the Sacramento Kings player has not provided any financial assistance to his son’s mother. Nichols’ rep, Harvey Englander, said, “Despite news reports stating otherwise, Tristan Thompson has done nothing to support his son. He has not made any attempt to meet their son nor has he provided any financial assistance.” In December 2021, Thompson was involved in a paternity suit with Nichols over the fathering of her son. During the period, reality TV star and one of Thompson’s baby mamas, Khloe, had stuck to him as they had both agreed to raise their daughter, True, together. However, the basketball player confirmed last month that he had a child with Nichols and had tendered an open apology to Khloe. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
