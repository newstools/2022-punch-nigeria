Veteran actor, Kanayo O. Kanayo, has advised parents to pay unscheduled visits to their children in school to avoid experiencing touching stories. The thespian made the revelation when he paid an unplanned visit to his son in school. In a short video clip posted on his Instagram page, Kanayo’s son was seen expressing surprise that his father visited him without a notice. In response, the elated actor said it would no longer be a surprise if he had informed his son of his intention to visit him. Kanayo, however, admonished parents to always check on their wards in school, adding that some children usually take advantage of the lack of regular visit to engage in illicit acts. He said, “If I told you I was coming, it won’t be a surprise again. Check on your wards without any notice. Give them surprise; most of the kids, you could think that your child is in a school in Epe but you child goes to Lekki every week to go and have fun. “A friend of mine had a bad experience. His son and I were in the law class but the boy had left school since 200 level but he was collecting school and hostel fees until we were about to graduate when his father came to see him. So always check on your wards, give them surprise visits.” A message attached to the post read, “Do you know many of our children leave school to go to unimaginable places? His or her school may be in Ekiti State, but is in Lekki Lagos State every weekend grooving. Please pay them unscheduled visits to avoid stories that may make you age under 48 hours.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
