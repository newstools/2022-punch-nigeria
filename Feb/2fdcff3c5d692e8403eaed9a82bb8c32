A former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd.), has warned politicians against using youths for political violence in the forthcoming elections, adding that the country already has enough security challenges. Abdulsalami gave this warning when he was conferred with an Honourary Doctorate Degree during the 30th convocation of the Federal University of Technology, Minna on Wednesday. He also advised youths not to allow themselves to be used by politicians to cause violence and disharmony. He said, “As we go into politics, caution Nigerians and politicians, please play the game wisely. Avoid using our children and grandchildren as propaganda and abusing them and trying to make them do what we know is wrong. “And for the youth, please avoid being used as thugs and arbitrators of disharmony and violence in the country.” Abdulsalami described the security challenges the country is faced with as a war without morality where people are killed without reason. “We are facing a hard time security-wise where the warfront is everywhere and this is a war without any morality where the old and the young are slaughtered without any cause. “Our security forces are overstretched. So, it is left to all of us to join hands in making sure we provide information where possible so that this situation will be addressed.” The university conferred Abdulsalami; the President of the African Development Bank, Dr Akinwumi Adesina; the Chairman of BUA Group of companies, Alhaji Abdulsamad Rabiu; and the Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Commission, Mele Kyari, with Honourary Doctorate Degrees.
