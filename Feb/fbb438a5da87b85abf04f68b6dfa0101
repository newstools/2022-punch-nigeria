Governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress on Monday evening met behind closed-door at the Kebbi Governors’ Lodge, Abuja. The meeting came a few hours after the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee postponed the party’s national convention earlier slated for February 26 by another one month; the third time since December 2021. Although the Progressives Governors’ Forum Chairman, Abubakar Bagudu, did not state the specific issues to be discussed at the meeting, it is believed that the meeting will discuss a consensus chairmanship candidate ahead of March 26. The meeting was also meant to enable the governors to take common positions on issues like zoning ahead of Tuesday’s meeting with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the Presidential Villa. In attendance at the Monday meeting were the Governors of Kebbi State, Abubakar Bagudu; Yobe, Mai Mala Buni; Borno, Babagana Zulum; Jigawa, Muhammad Abubakar; Ondo, Rotimi Akeredolu; Niger, Abubakar Bello; Kaduna, Nasir El-Rufai; Ekiti, Kayode Fayemi; Kogi, Yahaya Bello; Ogun, Dapo Abiodun; Ebonyi, Dave Umahi; Osun, Gboyega Oyetola; Lagos, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; Plateau, Simon Lalong; Imo, Hope Uzondinma; Nasarrawa, Abdullahi Sule, Kano, Abdullahi Ganduje; Kwara, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq and Deputy Governor of Anambra State, Nkem Okeke. As the time of filing this report, the meeting was still ongoing as governors of Katsina, Aminu Masari; Zamfara, Bello Matawalle; and  Cross River, Ben Ayade were yet to arrive. Copyright PUNCH.
