The Swedish Ambassador to Nigeria, Carl-Michael Gräns, has advised the Federal Government to focus on improving the socio-economic well-being of Nigerians as part of measures to address insecurity in the country. Gräns, who stated this during an interview with our correspondent, said good livelihoods and quality education would reduce criminality. “But in the longer term there should be a focus on social and economic development, livelihood for people, education, women empowerment and gender equality. Those are very general issues but the basis of the future society. “When people have a good livelihood and good education, they usually don’t rob other people or kidnap other people.  If people have alternatives, it would reduce criminality,” he said. He noted that though insecurity was a global issue, effective policing was important. “We have challenges in Sweden too when it comes to insecurity. It used to be a very safe country but we also have challenges like many countries in Europe and all over the world,” he said. On the 2023 general elections, the Swedish ambassador said Nigeria could strengthen its democracy by discussing the challenges that needed to be fixed rather than focusing on personalities.
