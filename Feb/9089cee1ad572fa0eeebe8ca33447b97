President Felix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of Congo has praised the multi-award-winning musician, Koffi Olomide, for bagging the Legend Awards at the 2021 All-Africa Music Awards. While hosting Olomide at his official residence at Camp Tshatshi Palace, Kinshasa, on Monday, February 14, 2022, the President said the award was both a significant achievement for not just the singer, but the entire country. Olomide also presented his 24-carat gold-plated AFRIMA plaque to the President. President Tshisekedi, in recognition of the honour bestowed on him by AFRIMA as well as his work, also named the 65-year-old Soukous singer as the country’s ambassador of culture and presented him with a diplomatic passport. While receiving his diplomatic passport from President Tshisekedi, Olomide promised to maintain a reputation worthy of emulation by African youths. This appointment would see Olomide, who has been active in the Congolese music industry for over five decades, help boost DRC’s increasing attempts at repositioning its cultural and creative economy.
