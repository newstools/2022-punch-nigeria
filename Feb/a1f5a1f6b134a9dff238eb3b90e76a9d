Two goals by Ifeanyi Ogba ensured Lobi Stars tasted victory again in the Nigeria Professional Football League as they held on to a hard-fought 2-1 win over MFM on match-day 12 in Makurdi on Sunday. The win was Lobi’s first in five games and Ogba, who has won three man-of-the-match prizes in three home games, spoke of his delight at how his team held on to claim the match points. “I feel excited with the goals today (Sunday) and I want to thank my teammates and coaches for the motivation and encouragement. The last time I won this prize, we didn’t win the match but I’m happy today we did win and I promise to always do better,” Ogba told www.npfl.ng. On setting a goals tally for himself this season, he said, “I don’t want to put myself under undue pressure but I’m positive that I can get 15 goals this season, I also want to appeal to the fans to be patient with us, we are a young and new team which I believe will get better as we play on”. Substitute Oladayo Alabi’s late goal for the Olukoya Boys ended up as consolation after missing what could have earned his side a point in added minute. Lobi Stars were the better side in the first half and had deservedly had their nose in front with Ogba ending Adams Olamilekan’s cross with a guided header inside nine minutes of the game. He had his second of the game, his fourth this season- on the stroke of half an hour with Olamilekan yet the provider. He went close to recording a hat trick for Lobi with few minutes to end the first half but was denied by MFM keeper, Isaac Jerry. Lobi Stars will travel to Owerri to take on Heartland in the Matchday 13 while MFM will host Katsina United in Lagos.
