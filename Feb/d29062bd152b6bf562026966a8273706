The Federation of Informal Workers’ Organisations of Nigeria has begged the Federal Government to consider the lifting of the ban on the sale of petroleum products in border communities in Ogun State. The General Secretary, FIWON, Gbenga Komolafe, at a press briefing in Abeokuta on Tuesday, said, “We call on the Federal Government to immediately lift the ban on the sale of petroleum products in the border communities because people living here are also Nigerians. “It is sad to note that the supply of the grid electricity is particularly very scanty in these communities. What producers and working people in the informal sector are going through in the border communities without fuel to power generators which is the source of energy to drive the simple machines and equipment used by welders, hair dressers and barbers, corn and pepper grinders and everyone else at home to provide lighting, can best be imagined.” Komolafe alleged that his members were being harassed and extorted by security agencies. He said, “It is enough for the Customs Service to have its checkpoints limited to few entry points which are all well-known and make cross-border traders pay statutory duties and levies within the context of ECOWAS trade protocols. “Technology deployment such as scanners at necessary entry points at the borders, to detect banned goods, especially illegal arms and ammunition, should be enforced. “We appeal to the Ogun State government and Representatives of the border communities in the National Assembly and Ogun State House of Assembly to urgently intervene on behalf of the suffering people of these communities.” Copyright PUNCH.
