Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh, on Thursday celebrated her son, Andre, as he turned six years old. Her ex-husband, Olakunle Churchill, whom she welcomed her son with, also took to his Instagram page to hail the celebrant. Few hours later, Rosy Meurer, who is currently married to Churchill, joined the celebration spree as she shared a picture of her husband’s son on her Instagram page. Referring to Andre as ‘son’, Meurer showered prayer on her stepson, asking God to guide his path. She wrote, “Happy birthday son. May God guide you on your path and give you favor wherever you go. #king.” In Churchill’s birthday wish earlier, he wrote, “Happy birthday to my wonderful son. King Andre Omodayo Oladunni Churchill. God has a perfect plan for you. Grow in wisdom and understanding. Daddy loves you.” Tonto Dikeh, however, in her birthday wish, wrote her child’s name together with her own surname, Dikeh, which was also visible on the child’s Instagram handle. Celebrating her son, the actress had revealed that she acquired a piece of land for him in Scotland, and the land documents also had the name ‘Lord King Andre Dikeh.’ Tonto married Churchill in 2015 and they welcomed their son in 2016. In 2017, the couple divorced and Churchill married the Gambian-born actress, Rosy, in 2019. Rosy and Churchill welcomed a son together in 2021. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
