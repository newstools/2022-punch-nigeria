The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Wednesday, joined Christian leaders, members, family, and friends of the Primate of the Church of The Lord Worldwide, Dr Rufus Ositelu, to celebrate his 70th birthday. Buhari’s birthday wish was contained in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, titled, ‘President Buhari greets Primate of the Church of the Lord Worldwide, His Holiness, Most Rev Dr Rufus Okikiola Ositelu at 70’. The statement read in part, “President Buhari rejoices with the TCLW leader as he turns a septuagenarian, taking into account his many contributions to national development, particularly in education, health and infrastructure, and, most significantly, consistently upholding the nation in prayers. “The President believes the scholarly background of Dr Ositelu greatly impacted on his influence, teachings and leadership, and has translated into gains for many, showing clearly in the many leadership roles he has held, including former Vice-President of the Christian Council of Nigeria; former President and Initiator, United Aladura Churches, Christian Association of Nigeria; and former elected member of the Central Committee, Executive Committee and Finance Committee of the World Council of Churches. “Buhari affirms that the Aladura patriarch’s high sense of patriotism is evidenced in his position on counselling leaders on programmes and policies that directly improve the livelihood of people, empowerment of youths and women, and elimination of violence against women and children, which demonstrate his love for humanity.” He, therefore, prayed for the well-being of the church leader in health, strength, and wisdom.
