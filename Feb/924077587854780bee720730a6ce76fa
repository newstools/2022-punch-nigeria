A Peoples Democratic Party governorship aspirant in Akwa Ibom State, Pastor Umo Eno, has said the state needed a man of integrity to succeed Governor Emmanuel Udom. Eno said this, according to a statement on Tuesday, during his address at an interactive session with party members in Uyo, adding that he has pledged to work with the relevant stakeholders and others to secure the party’s ticket. He said, “The state needs a humane man of integrity with exceptional capacity to succeed Governor Udom Emmanuel and my ability to spot and deploy talents, passion for innovation and track record of excellence are attributes that I will bring on board while continuing the good work of the incumbent governor. “I have begun consultations with all levels of the party to ensure that PDP presents a united and formidable force during and after the primaries and I pledge to work towards earning the trust of more party faithful and delegates, as the selfless man of God who exudes a peaceful disposition in the race to take Akwa Ibom State and its people to greater heights.” Emmanuel described Eno as an aspirant who would ensure peace and security in the state. “Not only will his can-do spirit inspire our youths, he is a man of peace that will ensure that the peace and security of life that we have enjoyed in the last six years will be maintained and he will also be coming to office with an economic blueprint that will further guarantee economic prosperity for the Akwa Ibom people,” he reportedly said.
