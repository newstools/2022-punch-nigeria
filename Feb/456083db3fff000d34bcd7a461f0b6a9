The residents of the various communities that make up the Fadage CDC in Ogun State have become weary of bearing the heavy financial burden of providing basic amenities in their CDC. Residents who spoke with us revealed that the amenities (roads, police station, transformer, connection to national grid) that they are providing by themselves are facilities that the government should normally provide. They call on the Odeda LG to help with the issue of outstanding transformers, continue the connection of their community to the national grid. The CDC also wants schools to be provided for students in the communities. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
