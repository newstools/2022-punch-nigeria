Following the successful premiere of the Glo Battle of the Year Nigeria on February 5, 2022, on Globacom’s mobile streaming app, GloTV, the telecommunications and digital services provider announced on Wednesday it will extend the weekly broadcasts of the show to both the Nigerian Television Authority and the Africa Independent Television from this week. According to the statement, this season has begun on a high note with the first episode showcasing explosive contests that featured male break dancers battling in the audition/elimination rounds into quarterfinals of the ‘B-Boys’ dance category of the competition. The statement added, “The one hour show which was exclusively aired on Globacom’s top rated mobile streaming app, featured contests across six regional venues- Kaduna, Abuja, Enugu, Port Harcourt, Benin, and Lagos. “The excitement packed episode which saw several contestants’ showcasing jaw dropping break dance moves will air on Thursday, February 10, 2022 between 6pm and 7pm on NTA then on Friday, February 11, 2022 on AIT between 9pm and 10pm. The show will subsequently air weekly on GloTV app on Saturdays by 8pm, NTA on Sundays by 8pm and AIT on Tuesdays by 9pm. “Among the winners who qualified for the semi-finals from the first episode are dance talents equally gifted in other aspects of life including Abuja based gymnastics coach, BBOY Irah, six-foot tall dancer, BBOY Off, sociology graduate BBOY Victor Vic, Enugu based graphic designer BBOY Bliss, and fashion model BBOY Softy. The most impressive performances of the first episode were performances from BBOY Lil Vic in Abuja; BBOYs Jamz rock, Jerry, Duke, Whirlz in Benin, BBOY Pryme in Enugu and Pizaro in Lagos. While most of the participants were at their best and made it difficult for the judges, a few of the them did not live up to the competition’s high standards and therefore didn’t advance to the next round.”
