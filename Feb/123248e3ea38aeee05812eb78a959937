The Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, Ignatius Kaigama, has called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to listen to the cries of Nigerians and intensify action to resolve the problem of lingering fuel scarcity and the one-month warning strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities. Kaigama made the appeal on Sunday during the dedication of Holy Cross Parish, Gwarinpa in Abuja. According to him, Nigerian leaders must not ignore the voice of reason. Kaigama said, “Our nation would achieve greater progress when we truly listen to one another in mutual respect. Government leaders must listen to their citizens, politicians must listen to the people they represent. “This is the path to enduring peace, greater solidarity and harmony in our society and the best way to resolve problems such as the lingering fuel scarcity in the nation and the ASUU one-month warning strike to press home her demands from the government.”  Copyright PUNCH.
