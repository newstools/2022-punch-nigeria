Nollywood veteran, Joke Silva, has remembered her younger sister, Olabisi, three years after the latter’s death. The actress shared a throwback photo of herself and her artist sister on her Instagram page late Friday. Olabisi, the founder and Artistic Director of the Centre for Contemporary Art had died in February 2019 after a protracted battle with cancer. The art curator launched CCA in 2007 and later established the Asiko International Art School in Lagos. Marking Bisi’s third death anniversary, Joke revealed updates on her sister’s legacies. According to Joke, Bisi achieved in 15 years what others could not have achieved at 60 years. She also revealed that she missed Bisi, telling the deceased to “keep curating with Baba God.” The Nollywood veteran wrote, “OIabisi Obafunke Silva, @ccalagos is doing well. Many thanks to your industry children; Oyinda @uptown_boho being one of them. “She is now the Artistic Director and Executive Director CCA. I was speaking to Bunmi Oyinsan two nights ago and we were awed by your incredible laser focus. “You achieved in 15 years what others didn’t in 60. Especially after the cancer diagnosis came, it was like you were racing against the clock. “Asiko, your training school is back. Miss you girl. Keep curating with Baba God.” Copyright PUNCH.
