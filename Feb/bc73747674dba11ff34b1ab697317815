The United Kingdom Home Secretary, Priti Patel, told Parliament on Monday that Britain would lead international efforts to block Russia from the International Criminal Police Organisation, Interpol, as requested by the Ukrainian government. “The Ukrainian government has today requested that the Russian government be suspended from its membership of Interpol, and we will be leading all international efforts to that effect,” Patel said. Interpol  is an international organisation that facilitates police cooperation and crime control among its 195-member countries. Details later. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
