Justice D.A. Onyefulu of the Onitsha High Court on Wednesday sentenced to death two convicts, Valentine Umezinwa and Emeka Okolonji, for the murder of a sex worker, Blessing Eze. Before the judgment, Onyefulu listened to the cross-examination by the state counsel, N.S. Emeka, and the responses from prison officials, who testified to the good conduct of the convicts in correctional facilities. The mother of one of the convicts, Emeka Okolonji, who wept bitterly in court, said her son planned to study abroad and never followed a bad gang. In her ruling, Justice Onyefulu said counsel for the convicts had the option of appeal through the committee on the prerogative of mercy, adding that the state governor had the final say on the matter. The judge said, “The counsel has not shown enough reason why justice should be tempered with mercy.” Counsel for the state, Emeka, while speaking to our correspondent on the ruling, said justice had been served in the matter. The defence counsel, C. C. Okeke, said he received the judgment with an open heart, stressing that his team would appeal the ruling. The convicts were accused of killing Eze, a sex worker whom they lured, murdered and dumped her corpse around the DMGS axis of Onitsha.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
