The Lagos State Government would divert traffic as it has embarked on the casting of the Iyana-Iba Interchange Bridge round deck on Saturday. The Commissioner for Transportation, Frederic Oladeinde, in a statement on Wednesday, said the job would last for 24 hours. Oladeinde said the diversion was necessary to continue the ongoing construction of Lagos-Badagry Expressway, which had now attained an advanced stage. He said the state government was poised to complete the road works up to Okokomaiko as announced earlier. According to him, motorists on the service lane inbound Lagos will be diverted to NEPA Road, from Okokomaiko and Alaba Rago axis. He noted that vehicles would be directed to access Olojo drive, connect Alaba International Market and Volkswagen Bus stop, inward Mile 2, then proceed with their journey. Oladeinde added, “Also, traffic on the service lane inbound Lagos, heading toward Volkswagen, Mile 2 and LASU axis will be diverted to the toll lane/LRMT Corridor to reconnect the Lagos bound lane by Volkswagen for their desired destinations. “Motorists inward Badagry and Iba will use the service lane from Barracks to LASU and Okokomaiko to continue their Journey. “The State Traffic Management Authority will be on ground to manage the traffic flow and minimise inconvenience.” The commissioner appealed to residents to cooperate as the current administration actualised the promise to improve the transport network within the state.
