A former Chief of General Staff, Lt Gen Oladipo Diya (retd.), has said more work needs to be done by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to reposition the country’s economy and fight terrorism. A statement by Diya, titled, ‘Farewell: Chief Ernest Adegunle Oladeinde Shonekan’, called on other statesmen to as a matter of national call and duty fix Nigeria in all ramifications. He stated, “My advice for other statesmen is that we should endeavour as a matter of national call and duty, to fix Nigeria in all its ramifications, so that we can bequeath a worthy Nigeria to unborn generations.  The time to act is now. This is the time for strategic national advancement. It’s not a moment for finger-pointing or politicking. Although I have never been involved in politics, it is nevertheless to lay it bare and send a clear message that only justice, equity and fairness can take us out of the woods. “His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, is obviously doing his best in repositioning the economy and winning the war against terror. More work still needs to be done; the success of which rests not only in the barrel or sacrifice of our gallant armed forces, but more so by the cooperation of all Nigerians. A word should be enough for the wise.” While extolling Shonekan, the former CoGS said his legacy of excellence, hard work and integrity would be remembered.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
