A former presidential candidate of the Young Progressives Party, Prof Kingsley Moghalu, on Saturday, expressed deep concern about what he called “the fate of Nigerians in Ukraine” as the crisis in the country continued to escalate. In a series of tweets on his official Twitter handle, Moghalu said he contacted the ambassador of Poland in Nigeria, Joanna Tarnawska, to clarify a report which said that Polish nationals were allegedly denying Nigerians humanitarian access into Poland as residents fled from Ukraine in the face of the ongoing crisis. He said that Tarnawska refuted the report and assured him that Poland was allowing Nigerians to enter into the country on humanitarian grounds. “Deeply concerned about the fate of Nigerians in Ukraine and reports that Nigerians are being denied humanitarian access to neighbouring Poland, I contacted my good friend Joanna Tarnawska, Poland’s Ambassador in Nigeria, whom I know to be a great friend of our country and Africa. “She assured me this morning that the story is not true and that Nigerian nationals and Africans are being let into her country on humanitarian grounds,” Moghalu wrote. While appreciating Poland for her support to Nigerians, the former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria called on other nations to extend humanitarian assistance to Nigerians affected by the war in Ukraine. “I appreciate Poland’s support and urge all countries that are Ukraine’s neighbours to continue to extend humanitarian assistance to Nigerians affected by the horrendous situation in a Ukraine that has now become a theatre of aggression and armed conflict,” he tweeted.
