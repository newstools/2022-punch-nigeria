Former Big Brother Naija season five housemate, Wathoni Anyasi, on Sunday stated that she had no issues with her son calling her by her name. She made this known on Instagram while celebrating her son’s seventh birthday. Sharing pictures of her son, the single mother-of-one revealed that her son called her Tolu, which was her Yoruba name, whenever he was angry. According to her, calling her by her name was her son’s way of telling her how much he missed her. She wrote, “Happy seventh birthday, my amazing son. You bring joy to each and everyone that comes your way. “You are such a smart kid, and in every sense. You have different ways of expressing yourself, even those times you call me Tolu (my Yoruba name). “It doesn’t matter to be honest because those times I know you are mad at me or you know I am mad at you, especially when you are missing me. That’s probably your way of saying, ‘Mummy I need you here’. “You have been such a blessing and I thank God he brought you into my life. With you, I will do it again and again because the blessings you have brought in my life are not quantifiable. “Happy birthday baby. Mummy loves you so much and for you, I’m gonna use my last penny to take care of you.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
