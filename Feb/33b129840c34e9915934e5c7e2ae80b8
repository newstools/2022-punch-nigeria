The lifeless body of a popular plumber in Abraka, in the Ethiope East Local Government Area of Delta State, Ovoke Ogwa, has been found. The victim was abducted by yet-to-be-identified gunmen, who stormed his compound at Urhuovie-Abraka on January 10, 2022. PUNCH Metro gathered that Ogwa’s decomposing corpse with bullet wounds was discovered in Erho community by locals who went to fetch firewood in the bush on Tuesday. The Special Assistant to the Governor on Youth Development, Tony Ajaino, described the incident as “very pathetic”. He noted that he went with the police and some youths to retrieve the corpse. Ajaino said, “It looked like a kidnap case; but there could be more to it because according to reports, those who took him away on January 10, waited for him at his compound. They collected N500,000 as ransom on the 12th, two days after he was taken. He was good at his job and well patronised. He handled all my plumbing jobs.” It was gathered that the deceased left behind a pregnant wife and four children. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Bright Edafe, confirmed the killing on Wednesday. He said, “Yes, it is confirmed and the body has been taken to a morgue.”  Copyright PUNCH.
