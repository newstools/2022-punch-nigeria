THE Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has opined that Nigeria would shake the day the southern part of the nation would declare its decision on the 2023 presidency. This was as the governor said the Peoples Democratic Party would not give its presidential ticket to any candidate who would serve the interest of the wealthy few in Nigeria only. Wike, however, noted that some desperate politicians who would not serve the interest of the many, rather the interest of the wealthy few were already scheming to be candidates. According to a statement by his Special Assistant on Media Kelvin Ebiri, in Port Harcourt, Saturday, Wike made the assertion at a grand reception organised in his honour by the people of Kalabari ethnic nationality in Asari Toru Local Government Area. The governor was conferred a traditional title of Se- Ibidokubo of Kalabari land (He who does good things for Kalabari people) and was performed by the Amayanabo of Abonnema, King Gboko Desreal Bob-manuel. He said, “The day the South will speak, Nigeria will shake. We believe in the unity of this country, but nobody can threaten us; nobody should threaten us. We believe in the unity of Nigeria and the unity of Nigeria must continue.” He told the Kalabari people that they had done well in terms of loving themselves and working in unity. Copyright PUNCH.
