GLASGOW Rangers boss Giovanni Van Bronckhorst has stated that contract talks with Nigeria international Joe Aribo will commence very soon with the Scottish giants keen on holding onto their key players for the foreseeable future. Aribo has less than 18 months left on his current contract and he has been linked with a move to several English Premier League clubs with Crystal Palace, Aston Villa, Leicester City, and Southampton among some of those clubs. The 25-year-old has been identified as a key player by Patrick Vieira ahead of next season and has been placed on top of their shopping list. Van Bronckhorst has opened up he is not ready to lose his best player and some others and revealed that the Gers would soon begin negotiations with the players. “No, I haven’t spoken with them about extending contracts,” Van Bronckhorst said when asked about the future of Aribo and Kent’s during his match press conference ahead of Thursday game. “That’s something the club will do in the near future, so we just need to make sure we have the future well planned.” “Of course, these are players who are very important for our club, so I think the talks will begin, but with players of these qualities, you want to have them as long as possible.” He added. Aribo has been a key figure since he arrived at Ibrox in 2019 from Charlton Athletic and was part of the Gers team side that won the 2020/21 Scottish Premiership title under former manager Steven Gerrard.
