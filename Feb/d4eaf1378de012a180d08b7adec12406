Vice President Yemi Osinbajo will on Monday morning depart Abuja for Monrovia, Liberia, to represent the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the formal launch of the year-long commemoration of the country’s Bicentennial Anniversary. Senior Special Assistant to the Vice President on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, revealed this in a statement he signed on Monday titled ‘Osinbajo to represent Nigeria at Liberia’s bicentennial celebrations’. According to Akande “Prof. Osinbajo will join other leaders across Africa and beyond to grace the event scheduled to hold today at the Samuel K. Doe Stadium in Monrovia. “The Vice President will also attend other events later today in Monrovia as part of the Liberian national celebrations.” Liberia was founded in 1822 when freed blacks began relocating to West Africa from the United States. On July 26, 1847, the country proclaimed its independence and became the Republic of Liberia. Osinbajo, who will be accompanied on the trip by Minister of State, Foreign Affairs, Zubairu Dada; and Special Adviser to the President on Economic Matters, Dr. Adeyemi Dipeolu, is expected back in the country on Tuesday, February 15.
