Organisers of the Oscars, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences have announced three hosts for the 94th edition of the awards. The trio of Wanda Sykes, Regina Hall, and Amy Schumer will grace the awards as hosts of the event. Entertainment Weekly on Tuesday reported that this would be the first time in over four years that the awards event would be hosted by three people. The event is scheduled for March 27, 2022, in Los Angeles, USA. All three are actresses with Sykes and Schumer as stand up comediennes. The programme producer of the Oscars, Will Packer, hoped that the hosts would bring their creative nuances to the event. Packer also described the hosts as “three of the most dynamic, hilarious women with very different comedic styles.” The Preshow hosts for the 2021 edition were actress, Ariana DeBose, and actor and comedian, Lil Rel Howery. Model, Lily Aldridge; Broadcast journalist, Tamron Hall; Film Critic, Elvis Mitchell, Actor, Billy Porter,  and Media Personality, Ryan Seacrest were preshow hosts for the year 2020. The British-Nigerian actor, David Oyelowo, played host for the 2019 edition of the awards as the ace comedian, Kelvin Hart, who was earlier billed to host the event, had to step down due to accusations of past usage of homophobic and transphobic comments. The ABC talk show host, Jimmy Kimmel, was the host for the 2018 edition of the Oscars.
