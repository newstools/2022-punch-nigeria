The Ogun State Police Command has arrested a 38-year-old man, one Akinyemi Thomas, for allegedly impersonating a police officer. The Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement on Saturday, saying the suspect was arrested on Thursday in a full police camouflage uniform under the bridge on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. Oyeyemi said the suspect was arrested while policemen attached to Sagamu divisional headquarters, led by the Divisional Police Officer, CSP Godwin Idehai, were on routine patrol of their area. He said, “His (suspect’s) conduct raised the suspicion of the policemen who then stopped to question him. Immediately the patrol vehicle stopped, the suspect took to his heels. He was then chased and apprehended. “On interrogation, he confessed being a dismissed policeman but using the uniform to extort unsuspecting members of the public. Recovered from him aside from the uniform is a police warrant card. The PPRO, however, said the  Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, had ordered a full investigation into the activities of the suspect to charge him to court as soon as possible.
