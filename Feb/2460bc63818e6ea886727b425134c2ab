A Federal High Court sitting in Awka, Anambra State, presided over by Justice Nnamdi Dimgba, on Thursday, discharged and acquitted one Obinna Obinwa, who was accused of drug dealing and consumption. Justice Dimgba discharged and acquitted the suspect for lack of diligent prosecution by the state. The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, in a suit number C/62/2021, had charged Obinwa before the Federal High Court for “illegal possession of Indian hemp”. When his case was called for hearing, the NDLEA was unable to present him before the court to defend himself for the second time. Dimgba, worried by the agency’s inability to produce the suspect before the court for the second consecutive time, discharged and acquitted the suspect for lack of diligent prosecution. Justice Dimgba in his ruling said that NDLEA and correctional centre were agents of the Federal Government and they should be able to harmonise and produce the suspect before the court any day he is required. According to him, since the NDLEA could not produce him before the court for the second time to defend himself, even when he was ready to face charges, he should be allowed to go home. He, therefore, ordered the prison authorities to immediately release him and allow him to go home since NDLEA has no case against him. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
