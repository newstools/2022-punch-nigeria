Immediate past Senator representing the Kaduna Central Senatorial District, Shehu Sani, has advised Nigerians to settle for studying in government-owned universities, rather than face war and racism in their quest for education abroad. He stated via his Twitter page that students “dying to study abroad” should instead “stay at home” and cope with incessant strikes by the Academic Staff Union of Universities. “Those who are dying to study abroad, stay at home and get into federal or state university. It’s better to hustle with ASUU than war and racism,” he tweeted. Sani’s tweet comes amid the reports of Nigerian students stranded in Ukraine which is facing an ongoing war with Russia. Reacting to the tweet, one Twitter user, @YarKafanchan, pointed at the state of insecurity in the Senator’s own state. He wrote, “Have you forgotten the students in Kaduna State who have spent and are still spending months in the dens of armed terrorists?” “This is a country where hundreds of teenage schoolgirls get kidnapped and spend month with their captors and it’s not major news. Nigerians are safer among racists,” @EugenehoCortez tweeted. @OgSadik stated that, “You should know a nation has failed its youth if the choice is between staying here and facing war/racism.” “The fact that Nigerians are willing to risk war and racism shows how much politicians like you have failed,” @originalBNV wrote.
