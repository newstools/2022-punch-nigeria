The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has extended heartfelt condolences to the Murray-Bruce family on the passing of their mother and matriarch, Margaret Murray-Bruce, aged 95. Buhari’s condolence message is contained in a statement signed on Wednesday by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, titled ‘President Buhari condoles with Murray-Bruce family on mother’s death’. The statement read, “The President pays tribute to the peace-loving and deeply religious woman who invested so much of her God-given resources and talent in developing people, adopting many children, inspiring them to face life’s challenges with determination, optimism and joy. “The President urges Ben Murray-Bruce, Founder Silverbird Group, Francis Murray-Bruce, and Guy Murray-Bruce, President, Silverbird Group and Chairman, Independent Broadcasters Association of Nigeria and other members of the Murray-Bruce family to find inspiration from Mama’s legacy, particularly her example of decency and always looking out for the best in others.” Buhari, therefore, prayed for the repose of the soul of the departed and comfort for the loved ones that mourn.
