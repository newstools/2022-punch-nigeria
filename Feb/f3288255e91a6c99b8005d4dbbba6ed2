Ahead of the 2023 general elections, an activist and youth advocate in Delta State, Eneware Emmanuel, has called on the former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godday Orubebe, to throw his weight behind the ongoing Ijaw Governorship Agenda in the State. Eneware, popularly known as the ‘Pentiger’, in a letter of appeal to the former minister, copies of which were made available to journalists in Warri on Sunday said, “It is bad for Ijaw to betray Ijaw, looking at how marginalised and balkanised we are as a people in Nigeria”. He begged Orubebe, who was a former governorship aspirant in 2015 to overlook how his kinsmen betrayed his aspiration, even at that time when an Ijaw citizen held sway as president of the country. The activist said, “Let bygone be bygone and support the Ijaw Agenda. Our struggle and fight should be on the Nigeria Government and the various draconian laws that prevent us from controlling and enjoying our resources, and not Ijaw against Ijaw. “It was very bad that your kinsmen and tribesmen never supported your ambition when we even have an Ijaw president that would have okayed it at once. “But you are a leader par excellence, an elder statesman, a political icon, mentor, trailblazer worthy of emulation. “I, therefore, appeal passionately to you as a patriotic and passionate Ijaw son to throw your weight in the Ijaw Governorship Agenda. “Not for anyone else, but for the sake of God and the Ijaw people, who are the most brutalized, marginalised, balkanised, and neglected people in the Nigeria nation.” Copyright PUNCH.
