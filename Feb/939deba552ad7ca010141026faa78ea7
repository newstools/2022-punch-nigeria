Turkish Super Lig side Fenerbahce have added Nigerian Slavia Prague striker Peter Olayinka to their transfer list and may emerge as a possible summer transfer target for the club. Olayinka put on a fine display on Thursday as Prague knocked out Fernabache from the Europa Conference League. Despite not finding the back of the net against the Turks, Fenerbahce manager İsmail Kartal was impressed by Olayinka’s performance and described the Nigerian international as ‘a complete team player.” The Yellow Canaries are currently sixth on the Super Lig table with 43 points, a massive 23 points behind the leaders. According to Aspor, Fernabahce consider this season over with preparation for next season in top gear and will try to sign the player in the summer. “Saying goodbye to Europe by being eliminated by Slavia Prague in the Conference League, Fenerbahce caught sight of Peter Olayinka, the left-winger of the opponents,” the website wrote. “It was learned that coach İsmail Kartal commented on the 26-year-old Nigerian as ‘a complete team player.’ “No transfer offer has been made for Olayinka. However, the terms were asked. In the news in Sabah, it was learned that the fee of the player, who has a contract until July 2023, is €2m. “Fenerbahce managers will knock on the door of the Czech team at the end of the season, depending on the situation.” Olayinka joined Slavia Prague from Belgian side Gent in 2018 for €3.2m and already has seven goals and three assists in 27 matches this season.
