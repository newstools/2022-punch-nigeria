The Managing Director, Guinness Nigeria Plc, Baker Magunda, has said that women should be given the prerogative to choose the option of night shift if they so please as this would provide an avenue for equal opportunities for both female and male employees. Magunda said this at an event organised by the organisation titled ‘Diversity and Inclusion Drive towards Women in Leadership Growth.’ He explained that the issue of gender disparity is still one of the inhibitions for women to maximise their potential in Africa and it is something that must be collectively confronted. He said, “We are aware of some existing laws where females are not to work at night in our industry and for whatever reason; we are trying to work with the industry to let the government know that the law is an inhibition that we do not need any more in 2022. “Guinness is causing a change in policy and legislation. For instance, rather than having the Nigerian law that says women can’t work at night, a safe working environment should be created for them. “Stopping them from working at night limit their chances when they are placed on the same pedestal as their male colleagues who are not mandated not to work at night. “We are working with the Nigeria Employers Consultative Association, Ministry of Labour and we are hoping to see that change come to pass.” Copyright PUNCH.
