The Lagos Ferry Services has announced its partnership with private individuals and organisations to boost the water tourism sector of the state. The Managing Director of LagFerry, Mr Ladi Balogun, said this in a statement on Thursday, during the E-tourism Business Conference and Award. He said, “LagFerry has been partnering with private individuals and organisations to increase and promote tourism as well as improve the Lagos ecosystem by ensuring unhindered and safe mobility through the Lagos waterways. “The agency is partnering with a reputable tourism company, Goge Africa, to explore historical sites and monuments through the waterways within Nigeria and the West Africa Coast of Benin Republic, Cameroon and Sierra Leone.” Balogun added that the agency had acquired 20 world-standard boats in its fleets to aid the state waterways. “Through the dedication and unwavering support of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, LagFerry can boast of having 20 world-standard boats in its fleet, using it to set the standard of the kind of boats befitting a smart Lagos. Most of these boats were manufactured by local boat builders in Nigeria and are ideal for commercial and charter services,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
