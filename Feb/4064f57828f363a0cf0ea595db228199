An ad hoc committee set up by the House of Representatives to investigate estate developers in the Federal Capital Territory has decried the high rate of breaches and infringement on the laws and procedures governing real estate business in Nigeria. The committee condemned the developers for failing to deliver houses to their subscribers and building without necessary approvals by relevant government authorities. The House Ad Hoc Committee on Investigation of Operations of Real Estate Developers in the FCT toured sites in Abuja on Wednesday. The Chairman of the committee, Blessing Onuh, while speaking on the findings by the lawmakers after the tour, said they were “mind-boggling,” adding that the developers violated processes and regulations governing land and building in the nation’s capital. The panel inspected sites belonging to BILAAD, Brains and Hammers, KYC, and EFAB, among others. Onuh said the committee would analyse the various infractions by the developers and deal with them appropriately. She said, “You are all aware that this is an investigative committee and we are here on a fact-finding mission to discover what is on the ground, what the reality is. We commenced this committee in November last year, and all this while, we have been calling developers to our office and creating a platform between the developers and subscribers to have an interface to discuss.
