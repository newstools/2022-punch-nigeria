The principal suspect in the murder of five-year-old Hanifa Abubakar, Abdulmalik Tanko, on Monday denied abducting and killing the girl and pleaded not guilty to the charges filed against him. Tanko’s denial came during his trial alongside two others, Hashimu Isyaku and Fatima Jibrin, before the High Court 5, Kano, on Monday. Hanifa was abducted on December 4, 2021 on her way home from an Islamiyya school and was later discovered to have been killed by her teacher and school proprietor, Tanko, after demanding N6m ransom in the Dakata area of the Nasarawa Local Government Area of Kano State. Tanko had earlier confessed to newsmen at the Kano State Police Command that he kidnapped and killed the victim with N100 rat poison before burying her remains in a shallow grave in one of his schools. During the trial on Monday, Tanko and Hashimu made a u-turn and denied that Hanifa was poisoned and buried in a school as seen in a video earlier in the day. They only responded to one of the three charges read to them, which was conspiracy. Fatima also denied writing a letter to Hanifa’s parents on behalf of Tanko stating that a ransom of N6m was required to free her. The Commissioner for Justice in the state, who led the prosecution team, Musa Lawan, asked the court to allow the prosecution to present the evidence at the next hearing. The presiding judge, Justice Usman Naabba, adjourned the case till March 2 and 3 for hearing. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
