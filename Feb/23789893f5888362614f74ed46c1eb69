Data Scientist Network has said it donated four learn-at-home kiosks in Borno State and one in Makoko, Lagos. According to a statement, the kiosks were developed as a strategic intervention by DSN and Malezi, in partnership with Mastercard Foundation to support inclusive learning for students who live in rural/semi-urban locations and where there is an absence of teachers, electricity, and digital learning tools like smartphones, tablets and laptops. It described the kiosk as an omnichannel solar-powered facility developed to serve as an offline learning content distribution channel. While unveiling the kiosk in Maiduguri, the Senior Special Adviser to the Vice President on Humanitarian Interventions, Dr Mariam Masha, was quoted as saying, “The learn-at-home kiosk is a most welcome development that Data Science Nigeria, in partnership with Mastercard Foundation, has brought to students in Maiduguri. “For us here at the North East Children Trust, we’re excited at the learning possibilities this kiosk will bring to our students.” According to DSN, the first kiosk was activated and unveiled at the learning centre while the other three are currently in Government Girls College Maiduguri, Government College Maiduguri and Shehu Garbai School.
