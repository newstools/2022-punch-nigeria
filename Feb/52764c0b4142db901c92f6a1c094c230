The Lagos State Government, through its Waste Management Authority, has commenced fumigation exercises at various dumpsites across the state to protect residents and prevent health hazards. In a statement released on its official Facebook page, titled, ‘LAWMA begins fumigation of landfills’ on Monday, the government stated that the move was to make the sites safer for waste management operations. The Managing Director of LAWMA, Mr. Ibrahim Odumboni, said by making the sites safer, there would be a reduction in health risks to the communities housing the dumpsites. According to him, the dumpsites play critical roles in the waste management chain, paving way for the attainment of the agency’s vision of establishing a consistent cleaner environment. He said, “Dumpsites are crucial components for the delivery of Solid Waste Management (SWM), as they serve as the final destination for all solid waste collected from residences, businesses, and public spaces. They also support the protection of sanitation and public health”. Odumboni stated that the fumigation exercise, which started Sunday at Solous dumpsite, Igando, would be extended to other dumpsites across the metropolis to protect immediate and surrounding communities where the sites are located. “The goal of this exercise is to protect the public and minimise the negative impacts of the sites to the neighbouring communities. Already, several mitigation measures have been put in place by LAWMA. “These include leachate and stormwater infrastructure, periodic capping of non-active sections, traffic management, monthly fumigation of the dumpsites and immediate environs”, he said.
