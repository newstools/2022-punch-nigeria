The 91- year-old lecturer at the Faculty of Law, Adeleke University, Ede, Prof. Toriola Ajagbe, is dead. Ajagbe was promoted to the rank of a Senior Advocate of Nigeria in 2021 after he clocked 90 years. Our correspondent gathered that the nonagenarian died at the University College Hospital, Ibadan on Tuesday where he was receiving treatment following the injuries he sustained in an auto crash at Ode Omu in Osun State. His daughter, Mrs Kiitan Adeagbo, who confirmed her father’s death to our correspondent, said he was travelling to Ede from his base in Ibadan nine days ago when he was involved in the accident. He was taken to the Intensive Care Unit of the UCH where he died. Adeagbo said, “He was travelling to Ede last week Monday when the accident occurred and we eventually lost him.” Ajagbe was born on January 11, 1931 in Erunmu, a community in the Egbeda Local Government Area under Ibadan. He told our correspondent in an interview in October 2021 that he would not stop going to court as long as he had the energy to do so. He said, “Legal profession is unlike being a professor of Geography or History or Biology. We have no time limitation. The more time you spend, the more experience you have.”  Copyright PUNCH.
