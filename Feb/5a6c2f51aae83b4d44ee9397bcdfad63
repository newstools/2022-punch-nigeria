Peoples Democratic Party Governorship candidate in Ekiti State, Bisi Kolawole, said on Saturday that his administration would prioritise execution and implementation of youth-based agenda and projects in a bid to redirect the potential of the young ones to productive ventures. Kolawole, who spoke at his Efon Alaaye Ekiti hometown while playing host to youths of the party under the aegis of Victory Advocates of Nigeria, assured that
he would support activities of the group, which he said had been doing great jobs in promoting harmony in PDP. He said, “Considering the place of youths, my administration would place emphasis on them with youth-friendly projects, policies, and projects. There is a need to ensure better lives for youths. This will stem the tide of crime and add to the growth of the state and country. I encourage VAN leadership to continue their good work for the party”. Earlier, VAN National President, Seyi Ajibola, who congratulated Kolawole on his emergence as PDP candidate, charged him not to rest until all aggrieved members were reconciled back to the party, saying, “togetherness will make victory sweeter in the June 18 election”. Ajibola, who said, “Once a winner emerges, it is the responsibility of party faithful to join hands in ensuring victory for the party”, encouraged the party stalwarts to embrace peace with all, assuring that VAN would support the efforts of the party leadership in the electioneering to ensure PDP victory. Ekiti VAN Coordinator, Dr Seun Olowoyeye, who sought the party support for the group’s activities, restated members’ commitment to working for the victory of PDP in the June 18 election for the state to be able to move forward once again.
