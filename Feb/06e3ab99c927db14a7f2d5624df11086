Estranged Nollywood couple, Saidi Balogun and Faithia Williams (formerly Balogun), marked their birthday on Saturday and have received wishes from colleagues in the entertainment industry. Announcing her birthday via her Instagram page, Williams wrote, “It is with great pleasure that I am here to celebrate another year of my life. I am grateful for surviving all the challenges throughout the last 365 days and turning a year older. Happy Birthday to me.” Her ex-husband, Balogun, shared new photos on his Instagram page with the caption, “Stepping into the new age on eagle’s wings. It’s time to sour.” Williams and Balogun ended their marriage in 2006 but officially divorced in 2014. Faithia, however, kept her husband’s surname till 2017. Checks by our correspondent revealed that they had not celebrated each other on their Instagram pages as they marked their birthday today. Following their birthday announcement, celebrities have, however, taken to their social media pages to celebrate the estranged couple in separate messages. Iyabo Ojo, who recently ended her two-year feud with Williams, shared the latter’s picture on her Instagram page. Ojo wrote, “Happy birthday sis Faithia. Wishing you more greater years ahead. More success, more alert. Stay winning.” Also sharing Balogun’s picture, Ojo wrote, “Happy birthday my dear bro @saidibalogun. Wishing you more great years ahead in great health, wealth, and happiness.” Celebrating Williams, actress Mercy Aigbe wrote on Instagram, “Yeah. It’s world Adunni’s day! Happy birthday to my beautiful big sis.” Other actors and actresses who have celebrated Williams and Balogun include Uche Ogbodo, Kolawole Ajeyemi, Toyin Abraham, and many others. Copyright PUNCH.
