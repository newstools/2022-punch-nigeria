The President of the Senate, Senator Ahmed Lawan, has praised the Governor of Lagos State, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, for delivering dividends of good governance to the citizens of the state. Lawan said this on Sunday during the fifth town hall meeting and empowerment programme organised by the lawmaker representing Lagos West in the Senate, Senator Solomon Olamilekan, at the Police College, Ikeja. He said, “We have been watching you over the last two and half years because you have been very wonderful and consistent in terms of service delivery to the people of Lagos and indeed this country. You are focused and one good term you are doing deserves another term.” Sanwo-Olu commended the initiative organised by Olamilekan adding that it has complemented the efforts of the state. “Adeola’s empowerment programme is laudable because some of the items, such as the ambulances and hospital equipment, would go beyond party affiliations when they become operational. His efforts can be seen as complementing those of President Muhammadu Buhari and of the state government. “I want to reiterate this administration’s commitment to further develop Lagos state in all ramifications and I promise to continue to carry out human-friendly projects that will have positive impacts on Lagosians and by extension, Nigeria,” he said.
