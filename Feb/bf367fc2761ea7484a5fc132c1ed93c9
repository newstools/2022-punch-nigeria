Operatives of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Zamfara State Command, have arrested one 14-year-old Sani Suleiman for alleged banditry. In a press statement, the spokesperson for the command, Ikor Oche, said Suleiman, who hailed from Kadage village of the Zurmi Local Government Area of the state, was arrested by officers of the NSCDC during a routinous patrol, on the 7th of February, 2022, at about 1 am, in Samaru area of Gusau, the state capital. Oche said he was brought to the state headquarters in Gusau for investigations where it was discovered that he was trained by a bandit-kingpin on weapons handling. “The investigation revealed that he was trained by one bandit-kingpin, Salihu, at Sububu forest, on weapons handling. “He confessed to have participated in cattle rustling and kidnapping activities. “The teenager also confessed that he raped women who were kidnapped and brought to their custody.” Oche added that “investigation is still on, and once concluded, the corps will do the needful”. He therefore called on parents to keep vigilant eyes on their children, in order to avert bad attitudes amongst teenagers. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
