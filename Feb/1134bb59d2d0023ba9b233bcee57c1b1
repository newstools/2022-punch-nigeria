United coach Aliyu Zubairu has exclusively told PUNCH Sports Extra how his side ended Remo Stars 11-game unbeaten run in the Nigeria Professional Football League on Sunday. Ibrahim Yahaya’s 15th minute strike was enough to claim victory for the Savannah Scorpions and fire them to 10th position, with 16 points from 12 games, while Remo dropped from first to third on the log after their match-day 12 fixture at the Pantami Stadium, Gombe. Zubairu, in an interview with our correspondent, had boasted before the game that he would end the visitors’ unbeaten run, insisting “my home has never disappointed me.” Having fulfilled his pledge, he told PUNCH Sports Extra how his side orchestrated the win. “I know Remo Stars in and out and I know their mode of operation, the way they approach their matches. That was why we took the fight to them in the first 10 minutes,” Zubairu said. “We know the only thing they do is sit back, waiting for the right moment to take us on the counter; so we went out on them; before they could settle, we destabilised them and got the goal.” Zubairu added that they were going to take the winning mentality to Uyo, when they battle struggling Dakkada on match-day 13. “This victory won’t get into our heads, so we are going to Dakkada to win.”  All rights reserved.
