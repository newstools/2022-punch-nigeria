The year-old divorce battle between rapper Kanye West and reality TV star, Kim Kardashian, has taken a new turn, as the rapper turned down his estranged wife’s petition. Ye, as he is formally called, has responded to Kim’s petition for her to be declared single before resolving their property and custody issues. Kim’s petition obtained by E! News partly read, “Irreconcilable differences have led to the irremediable breakdown of the marriage, and there is no possibility of saving the marriage through counseling or other means. “The continued maintenance of technical marital status between [Kim] and [Ye] serves no useful purpose, and there is no reason to maintain the legal relationship.” In new legal documents acquired by TMZ, the rapper’s response revealed that he had no issue with Kim being declared single but he wanted them to ensure their assets are safeguarded before then. Ye’s lawyer noted a three-point demand against Kim’s petition. First, he wanted them to reimburse any debt one owed the other in case of death. Next, Ye wanted Kim to be blocked from transferring assets out of their mutual trust fund. The rapper also demanded a waiver on their marital privilege pending a final custody decision. According to the lawyer, however, Kim has refused to agree to the aforementioned demands. Despite the divorce battle, the duo had moved on with several romantic relationships. Kanye had had a romantic relationship with actress Julia Fox while comedian and show host, Pete Davidson, recently called Kim his girlfriend. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
