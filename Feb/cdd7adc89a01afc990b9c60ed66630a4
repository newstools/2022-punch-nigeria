The Chancellor of Southwestern University, Okun Owa, Ogun State, Babatunde Odufuwa, has described education as a key driver to spur development and growth in the country. Odufuwa stated this during the second convocation ceremony of the university held at the main campus of the institution, Okun Owa, Odogbolu Local Government Area of Ogun State. A total of 250 students were conferred with Bachelor’s degrees from the Faculty of Social and Management Science and Faculty of Pure and Applied Science for the 2020/2021 academic session. While stressing the need for human capital development, Odufuwa submitted that to build the capacity of the country, the people must be properly trained with knowledge, skills and experience. He said Nigeria would remain dormant unless her human resources were adequately developed and utilised. He said, “In many countries, education is viewed as a good investment to national developments, as it is expected that the educational system will produce the quality and quantity of human resources required for the economic growth of the country. “Education remains the most important element in the process of human progress whereby ignorance is eliminated and the development of knowledge, skills, talents and the capacities of human beings are attained. He said, “Business Ethics is a big issue in Nigeria’s environment. There is currently a deficit of ethics and integrity at several leadership levels in the country today. Graduands must maintain a high sense of discipline and embrace qualitative education.” The Acting Vice-Chancellor Prof. Babatunde Odesanya, charged the graduands to be agents of impact to the society.
