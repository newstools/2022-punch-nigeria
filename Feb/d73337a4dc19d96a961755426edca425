Veteran Nollywood actress, Shan George, on Sunday called out fellow celebrities who do not reciprocate the love they receive. In her Instagram story, the actress was referring to an undisclosed celebrity whom she followed but decided to use their fan page to follow her back. She noted that though celebrity status may die, the love from fans doesn’t die. George further advised celebrities to reciprocate the love they receive, adding that doing so won’t lead to their deaths.

Show love back(sic), you won’t die.” In her next Instagram story, the actress also knocked those who feel another cannot make it without them. She wrote, “When they swear you’ll never make it without them, but u still dey constantly chop bellefull pass them. Their fada.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
