NIGERIA international Wilfred Ndidi has opened up on his friendship with teammate Kelechi Iheancho, describing the latter as an amazing and great friend. Ndidi and Iheanacho have struck up a strong friendship playing together for both country and Leicester City and the midfielder said their relationship has gone beyond just being teammates. Both players were part of the Nigeria youth setup before graduating to the Super Eagles. Iheanacho joined The Foxes from Manchester City in 2015, after struggling to make the grade with the Citizens. Two years later he was joined by Ndidi, who was signed to replace Ngolo Kante after the Frenchman joined Chelsea following a stellar performance in the 2015/16 season that saw the club win the Premier League title. The duo has spent five years together at the King Power Stadium and speaking ahead of their Europa Conference League against Randers, the 25-year-old midfielder revealed how close he is to his countryman. “The relationship between me and Iheanacho is very great. It’s amazing because people thought we were just teammates, playing for Leicester and playing for the national team,” Ndidi said as quoted by the club’s official website. “But I have known Kelechi since we were in the academy, very young, so it’s not just new. We’ve been very close since we were in Nigeria Under-17s together. It’s been amazing having him around. I’m enjoying every moment.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
