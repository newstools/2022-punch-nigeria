Nigeria’s D’Tigress defeated Mali 73-69 on Sunday to qualify for the 2022 FIBA Women’s World Cup slated for Sydney, Australia. D’Tigress had on Friday beat world number five-ranked team, France 67-65. The reigning African Champions had put up a strong resistance but bowed to the superior power of China in their opening game, losing 76-90 to the seventh-ranked team in the world on Thursday. However, the team led by Coach Otis Hughley did just enough in their second game against France as the D’Tigress rallied back from a 17-point deficit in the first quarter to snatch a win and book their second consecutive world cup outing with a game to spare. Second-quarter saw a more purposeful and dominant D’Tigress crawl their way back into the game with a 16-10 points win to close the first half 27-38. Not comfortable with the scores, the team applied more pressure to win the third quarter 21-14 before another impressive 19-13 points finish in the fourth quarter to seal the win. Congratulating the ladies, the President of Nigeria Basketball Federation, Igoche Mark, said that the team showed the true Nigerian spirit by defying the odds to qualify. “Congratulations dear Champions, I have never doubted your abilities. “Thank you for putting up a good fight. You have made the federation proud, the country is proud of your performance. “You defied every odd to beat one of the best basketball teams in the world, that’s the Nigerian spirit. “You have conquered one of the best in the world and it is now time to step it up a notch as we stand solidly behind you in your next game against Mali. Keep soaring higher,” he said.
