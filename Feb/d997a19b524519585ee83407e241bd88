The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Limited says it is distributing one billion litres of safe Premium Motor Spirit, known as petrol, in its stock to various fuel stations nationwide. The NNPC also noted that 2.3 billion litres of PMS would arrive in Nigeria between now and February ending to address the current situation and restore sufficiency. Group Executive Director, Downstream, NNPC, Adetunji Adeyemi, disclosed this on Tuesday in Abuja while briefing newsmen. Adeyemi said this would address the situation and restore the sufficiency level above the national target of 30 days. He said that the NNPC understood the current fuel supply disruptions in many parts of the country caused by the discovery and subsequent quarantine of methanol blended cargoes of PMS. He said, “As of today, NNPC has one billion litres of petrol in stock and the petrol being dispensed today at various fuel stations in the country is safe. “In order to accelerate PMS distribution across the country, NNPC has commenced operations at its Depots and Retail Outlets.” Similarly, he noted that the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria, Depot Owners and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria and the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria have commenced 24 hours loading and dispensing activities in some of their designated outlets. He added that NNPC has constituted a monitoring team with the support of the Nigeria Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Authority and other security agencies to ensure the smooth distribution of PMS nationwide. “NNPC implores Nigerians to avoid panic buying and assures that the ongoing efforts would be sustained to restore normalcy in few days time,” Adeyemi added.
