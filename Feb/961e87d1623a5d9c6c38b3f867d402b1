The Ebonyi chapter of the Nigeria Union of Journalists has urged security agencies in the country to relate with and treat journalists on election duties as partners in progress rather than foes. The request formed part of the communique issued by the council at the end of its monthly congress on Friday in Abakaliki. The communique, which was signed by the council Chairman, Tony Nwizi, said that there was need for security agencies, especially the Nigerian Army and Police, to always collaborate to ensure hitch-free elections. It argued that the request had become necessary as the country began preparations in earnest for the 2023 general elections. Ebonyi NUJ stated that journalists in the state remained committed to sustaining their contribution to the socio-economic and political development of the state through factual and objective reportage of events and government’s programmes and activities. The statement partly read, “The council is working assiduously to ensure the safety of journalists in the line of their duty as we prepare for the 2023 elections. “We call on security agencies and major actors in the political circle to see journalists as partners in progress. It maintained that Ebonyi NUJ “is satisfied with the overwhelming infrastructure and human capital development taking place across the state, courtesy of Governor David Umahi”. The council commended Umahi for accepting the call by the people of the state to run for the presidential election in 2023. It urged Nigerians to support the governor’s aspiration, irrespective of tribe, religion or political leaning, for equity, political inclusiveness and a better country. (NAN)
