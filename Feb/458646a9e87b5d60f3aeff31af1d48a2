A group, Youth Engagement and Inclusion Agenda, has demanded that every political party should reserve the vice-presidential seat for the youth. Speaking at the inaugural meeting of the group in Ikeja, the convener, Idris Aregbe, said the governorship candidates across the country should also toe the same line by picking competent youths as their running mates, adding that this would help to inculcate nation-building in the next generation of leaders. He said, “Our request is not too difficult to be done by any of the presidential candidates as this will prevent a leadership vacuum that may arise when the crops of leaders across the country retire from active politics and the need to proffer solutions to the country’s challenges. “Reserving these seats for the youths remain the best system to teach the youths how to get involved and learn the ropes from the leaders that have garnered the experience over the years. We decided on the demands after several minutes of deliberations on the state of the nation and the fate of the youths after the next general elections across the country.” Aregbe noted that they were not interested in any party, adding that they aimed at ensuring that a young Nigerian occupied the seat and becomes the country’s number two citizen.
