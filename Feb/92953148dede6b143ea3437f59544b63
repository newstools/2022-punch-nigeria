Remo Stars head coach Gbenga Ogunbote expects a tough match against Kano Pillars on match-day 10 of the Nigeria Professional Football League, The PUNCH reports. The two sides clash at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium in Kaduna on Wednesday (today) due to the poor state of the Sani Abacha Stadium pitch in Kano. While the Ikenne-Remo, Ogun State club have been in fine form upon their return to the topflight, where they are yet to lose a game after nine matches, their hosts have not been formidable this season and have lost four matches already and drew one. Despite the contrast in their form heading into the game, Ogunbote said Remo remained the underdogs, and expects a tough game in Kaduna. “We are definitely expecting a tough game against Kano Pillars because there are no easy games in the Nigerian league,” Ogunbote told The PUNCH.“It’s going to be quite tough because we played on Sunday and we boarded our flight to Kaduna, which means we only had two days rest. “Also, Kano Pillars are a big name in the country and we are the underdogs here, despite our impressive start to the season. They are a big club because when you talk about clubs in the Nigerian league the likes of Pillars, Enyimba, Rangers are the names that come to mind and not Remo Stars, who just gained promotion to the league.” Copyright PUNCH.
