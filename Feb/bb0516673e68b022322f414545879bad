Stakeholders in the real estate sector have called on federal and governments to improve on technology deployment in order to effectively solve the various challenges in the sector. The call was made during an interactive session at this year’s Real Estate Outlook, an annual conference organised by Alphacrux. The event, designed to chart the course for the sector at the beginning of each year, was themed ‘Prices, pandemics, politics – Opportunity or a challenge’. The convener, Mr. Tobi Adama, said the 2022 edition of the conference was designed to review the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the real estate sector while also using the session to examine how the 2023 elections would affect the sector. He said, “Real Estate Outlook for this year is designed to bring up issues and lessons learnt from the pandemic; its effects on pricing and participation of investors in the sector. “It was also specifically designed to put the general elections coming up in 2023 to the front burner among stakeholders in order for them to proactively prepare for the effects the electioneering process will have on the sector.” Speakers during the interactive session identified technology as capable of addressing most of the challenges being presently experienced in the industry. According to them, technology is capable of eliminating activities of middlemen, generate reliable database, improve fraction ownership participation, securing property documents, and help government in policy monitoring as well as property design and marketing.
