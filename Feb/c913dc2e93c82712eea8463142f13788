The Special Adviser to the Gombe State Governor on Social Investment Programme, Dijatu Bappa, has tendered her letter of resignation. The Social Investment Programme include; National Home Grown School Feeding Programme, Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme. Others are; Job creation and Youth Employment, National Social Safety Net Programme, National Cash Transfer Programme. Bappa, who was a member of the Muhammadu Yahaya-led administration, on Tuesday, lauded the efforts of the governor for finding her worthy to occupy the position. In a letter dated February 1, 2022, the erstwhile political appointee, didn’t disclose the reason(s) for her resignation. The viral letter of resignation which was addressed to the governor has the stamp of the Government House acknowledging its receipt. She wrote, “I write to inform you of my decision terminate my service as Special to his excellency governor of Gombe State on Social Investment Programme with effect from 1st February 2022. “Your excellency sir, I sincerely thank you for giving me this golden opportunity to serve under your able leadership. It is indeed a rare privilege for me to serve in that capacity.” It is, however, unclear if the former aide is resigning due to emerging squabble, as Bappa is said to have close ties with ex-Governor Danjuma Goje, now senator representing Gombe Central.
