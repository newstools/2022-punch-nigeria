Journalists assigned to cover the convention of the All Progressives Congress waited endlessly in a long queue on Tuesday to complete accreditation and pick up their tags. The delay in the distribution of accreditation tags was attributed to the shoddy arrangement put in place by the APC publicity team. The development comes barely 24 hours after the rescheduled presidential primary kicked off at the popular Eagle Square in Abuja. Despite spending the better part of the weekend and the first day of convention thronging the party secretariat, the newsmen selected by their media houses could not secure the tags. Many reporters who flocked to the Eagle Square flaunting their press pass on Monday were turned back to get clearance from the organising committee or come with genuine accreditation card. On Tuesday morning, journalists who have started showing strains of fatigue were asked to show up at Rayfield Hotel in Asokoro where it took hours of shoving and pushing before they secured the accreditation cards. While that was going on, party delegates were also going through a routine registration for accreditation at the International Conference Centre in the Central Business District of Abuja.
