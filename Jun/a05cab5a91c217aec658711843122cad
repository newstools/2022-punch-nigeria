The Lagos State Commissioner for Science and Technology, Mr Hakeem Fahm, has charged scientists and tech-savvy people in the state civil service to strengthen research that will enhance creativity and innovation capable of invigorating prompt service delivery in the state. According to a statement by the state government on Sunday, Fahm gave the charge while presenting a cheque of N2.5 million to a scientist in the state civil service, Mr Oluwaseun Ogunmolu, for developing a user-friendly mobile application named ‘Alausa Sabi’ to improve knowledge, aid seamless communication, and efficiency of the entire workforce of the Lagos State Government. The statement said Fahm further expressed the belief “that creativity and innovativeness rest on active participation in science and technology, stressing that “our progress and collective achievement as a state ultimately rests on our being active in science and technology.” The commissioner explained that the ‘Alausa Sabi’ App is an online and offline interactive learning application intended to promote a fun way to study and enhance staff knowledge about the history of Lagos State, Public Service Rules, Financial Regulations, Nigeria Constitutions, and the Lagos State Development Plan, among others.
