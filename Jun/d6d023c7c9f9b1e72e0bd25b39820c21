Oyo State ex-governor, Rashidi Ladoja will on Friday (today) be installed as the Otun Olubadan by the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Lekan Balogun. This is contained in a statement issued on Thursday through the media aide of the monarch, Mr Oladele Ogunshola. The elevation of the former governor, who holds the title of Osi-Olubadan is sequel to the vacuum created by the demise of the former Olubadan, late Oba Saliu Adetunji, which paved the way for the promotion and installation of  Oba Balogun as the new Olubadan of Ibadanland on March 11,  2022. The monarch said the promotion of Ladoja would pave the way for the upward movement of the High Chiefs behind him as discussed at the last meeting of the Olubadan Advisory Council. The statement read, “Following the promotion of the former governor, High Chief Eddy Oyewole who presently holds the title of Ashipa Olubadan would become Osi-Olubadan and High Chief Biodun Kola-Daisi would from Ekerin Olubadan become Ashipa Olubadan.”
