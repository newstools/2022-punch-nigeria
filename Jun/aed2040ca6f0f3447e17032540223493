The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has released the suspended Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmad Idris, who was arrested for alleged involvement in N174bn fraud. Idris was released on bail from the custody of the anti-graft agency on Wednesday night in Abuja, and has since been reunited with his family. The EFCC Public Relations Officer, Wilson Uwujaren, confirmed this to our correspondent on Thursday. “The suspended Accountant-General is out on bail. He was released on Wednesday night,” Uwujaren said. The PUNCH reported that Idris was arrested by EFCC operatives on May 16, 2022. Three days after his arrest, Idris was suspended by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, to enable him to stand trial. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
