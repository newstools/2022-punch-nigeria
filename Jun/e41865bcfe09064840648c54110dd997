A Nigerian man, Obinna Igbokwe, on Thursday died by suicide after shooting his wife, Tangela, and grandmother in Texas, United States of America. NBC reported that Igbokwe left home with his three-month-old son, after shooting both women in their heads on Wednesday. Though the wife is critically injured and hospitalised, her grandmother died from the injury. While on the run, Igbokwe dropped the child in a car seat at a local hotel. When the police was alerted of his presence in the area, the suspect shot himself and died from the injury. A statement from the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office on Thursday read, “On June 2, 2022, at about 12:00 am Detectives with the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office were contacted by the Corsicana Police Department and advised they had Mansa Igbokwe in their care. “According to the Corsicana Police Department, a male dropped off the child in a car seat at a local hotel and said he would be right back, but never returned. “Since the male did not return the Corsicana Police Department was contacted and learned the male left in a white passenger car, which they believed to be Igbokwe. “Additional alerts were sent out to local Ellis and Navarro County law enforcement agencies alerting them that Igbokwe was in the area.” Copyright PUNCH.
