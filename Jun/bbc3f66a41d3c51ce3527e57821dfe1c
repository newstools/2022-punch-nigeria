As the 2,340 delegates prepare to determine the fate of presidential aspirants of the All Progressives Congress, the National Chairman of the party, Abdullahi Adamu, has called for a compromise to be reached on all fronts. Adamu, who made the appeal in his opening speech, emphasised that no human society can survive without it. The APC national disclosed that it is the bedrock of democracy, which everybody including delegates and aspirants should not be afraid to imbibe. “We cannot continue to make our choice out of sentiments or other primordial considerations. That will only invoke in us a wrong choice that we might regret. “In the course of this decision making, we need to be called upon to make compromises to achieve our goals and objectives as a party. “Democracy, by its nature, permits such compromises in the spirit of give and take. Indeed, no human society can survive without compromises. “Let us, therefore, not be afraid of making them with clear conscience and sense of responsibilities,” he urged. Adamu’s call is calling less than an hour before ballot casting that will see the National Leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, lock horns with Vice president Yemi Osinbajo; former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and 18 other presidential hopefuls for the APC ticket.
