The Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Lekan Balogun, has tasked the newly elevated High Chiefs in Ibadanland to be security conscious and prevent infiltration of their communities by terrorists and other criminals. The Olubadan, who was represented by the Otun Balogun of Ibadanland, High Chief Tajudeen Ajibola, said this at the installation of the High Chiefs to their new offices in Ibadan on Friday. Those elevated were former Governor Rashidi Ladoja from Osi Olubadan to Otun Olubadan; High Chief Eddy Oyewole from Ashipa Olubadan to Osi Olubadan; High Chief Abiodun Kola-Daisi from Ekerin Olubadan to Ashipa Olubadan; High Chief  Hamidu Ajibade from Ekarun Olubadan to Ekerin Olubadan; and Adebayo Akande from Abese Olubadan to Ekarun Olubadan of Ibadanland. Olubadan said, “The high chiefs who have just been promoted should be up to the task in discharging the responsibilities they have been saddled with. The high chiefs are to oversee security, ensure peace and happiness of the people in their communities. “So, we enjoin them to be vigilant, shine their eyes very well. They must make sure that anything that happens in their communities must be settled. Above all, they should oversee security.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
