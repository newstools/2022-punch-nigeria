Six schools have qualified for the Aitah’s Golden Arrow maiden annual quiz competition. A statement by the nongovernmental organisation said the final event would take place on June 15, 2022, at the Banquet Hall University of Benin, Ugbowo Campus, to award six students for academic excellence, teachers, and schools for their contribution to education. The Founder of Aitah’s Golden Arrow, Eddy Aitah who was represented by Itoro Lawrence said the initiative was an idea that had turned into reality to reward academic excellence among secondary school students in Edo State. She stated, “Aitah’s Golden Arrow promotes Integrity, transparency, and excellence and this can be seen in the way we conducted our examination. It was a fair and transparent examination marked in the hall by professional invigilators with supervision from all the teachers of the schools present and the results were announced on the same day. ‘‘At the end of the examination, six schools qualify for the finals with a tie-in point between two schools. The registered schools comprise public and private schools in all the 18 Local Governments in Edo State. The purpose is to create an equal playground for public and private schools to compete.’’ Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
