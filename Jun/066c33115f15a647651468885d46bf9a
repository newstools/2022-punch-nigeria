The Interim Administrator, Presidential Amnesty Programme, Col. Milland Dixon Dikio (retd), has called on contractors engaged by the scheme to make entrepreneurs out of the ex-agitators that will be sent to their firms. Dikio said the directive to the contractors was in tandem with the Train, Employ and Mentor (TEM) model, which he described as novel. Dikio, who spoke at a one-day sensitisation workshop organised by PAP in Abuja at the weekend to teach contractors the TEM model, warned that vendors must stick to their terms of reference. The amnesty administrator stated this in a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media, Neotabase Egbe, and made available to our correspondent in Port Harcourt through electronic mail. He insisted that the vendors must ensure that each ex-agitator received sufficient training that would make him an employer of labour and owner of a functional enterprise at the end of the programme.
