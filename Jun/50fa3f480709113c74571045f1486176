No fewer than 11 people were killed on Sunday in a renewed attack by suspected herders at Igama community in the Okpokwu Local Government Area of Benue State. Sources in the area said no building was standing in the community as the invaders burnt down all houses. “The hoodlums, who are Fulani herdsmen, stormed Igama village in the wee hours of today (Sunday) and directed their attack at the youth in the community. “They allowed the elderly, children and women to run away, while they descended on the youth. As I am talking to you, 11 young men have been killed,” the local, who did not want to be identified, told our correspondent on the phone. The Chairman of the council, Mrs Amina Audu, confirmed the attack. She said nine corpses had been recovered as of the time she spoke to our correspondent on the phone around 4.22pm on Sunday. Audu said, “I got a report that Fulani herders stormed Igama community between 4am and 6am today (Sunday). “As I am talking to you now, I am in the police station at Okpoga. Three corpses have been brought from the community and people from the area just told me that they are on their way with another six corpses to be taken to a mortuary.” The state police spokesperson, Catherine Anene, a Superintendent of Police, confirmed the attack, but said the command had yet to get details. “The incident is confirmed, but the command is yet to receive details from officers who went to the scene,” Anene said.
