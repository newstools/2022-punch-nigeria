Super Eagles coach is hopeful of upstaging Guinea Bissau at the top of Group A of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, after their clash against island country Sao Tome and Principe on Monday (today). The game comes up in Marrakech, Morocco after the Sao Tomeans couldn’t present a suitable home venue for the qualification series. The Eagles beat a stubborn Sierra Leone side 2-1 in their first game of the qualifiers in Abuja on Thursday but are placed second on goals difference after Guinea Bissau hammered Sao Tome 5-1 in their opening tie in Marrakech. Speaking ahead of the tie against the Sao Tomeans, Peseiro said with his side’s pedigree, they deserved to occupy the top spot in Group A and would do so with a convincing style against their less-fancied opponents today. “Yes, we want to be at the top of the table, that is why we must fight hard against every opponent and we must commit ourselves fully to winning every match. Like I said last week, Nigeria have a huge pedigree with quality players. It’s very important that we select the best at all times to win the big games,” Peseiro said.
