Inter Milan legend Christian Vieri has urged English Premier League side, Liverpool, to sign Napoli’s Victor Osimhen as a potential replacement for Sadio Mane. Man has been heavily linked with an exit from the Anfield outfit with Bayern Munich his possible destination. Osimhen is equally no stranger to transfer speculations with the Nigerians being linked with several European clubs ahead of next season. Osimhen had a fantastic 2021/22 season at Napoli, scoring 18 goals in 32 appearances across all competitions. The 23-year-old was also named the Italian Serie A Most Valuable Player for U-23 footballers last season and has been one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe ahead of the transfer window with Arsenal believed to be leading the race for the Nigeria international. According to calcionapoli24.it, an Italian publication, Vieri believes Osimhen’s style suits that of the Premier League side and has urged the Reds to sign the Nigerian as replacement for Mane. “If I’m Liverpool I’m going to get Osimhen from Napoli,”the Italian legend was quoted as saying. “Everyone in Klopp’s team runs, they go at a thousand per hour, it would be perfect.” Osimhen’s contract is set to expire on June 30, 2025, although Napoli is said to be open to proposals in excess of €110. Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal have all been linked with a move for the former Lille striker. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
