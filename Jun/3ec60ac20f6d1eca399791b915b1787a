The Peoples Democratic Party aspirants for Lagos State House of Assembly have called on the party’s National Working Committee to order fresh primaries in the state just as it did for their House of Representatives counterparts. The aspirants said both primaries for House of Representatives and House of Assembly seats were botched on May 22, 2022. The aspirants alleged that the ruling All Progressives Congress has infiltrated the party hierarchy in the state. They affirmed that there were no primary elections across the state on Sunday, May 22, 2022. The aspirants, who spoke in a statement on Sunday, are House of Assembly hopefuls for Surulere Constituency 2, Oladotun Sodunke;  Mainland Constituency 1, Aduragbemi and  Oshodi constituency, Muyideen. The statement read in part, “Delegates of the PDP were sidelined by the people that just came into the party a few months ago, in connivance with the PDP leaders known for a history of working against the party during elections. “In spite of the state executive’s objection to the skewed ad hoc list, they forced their way to ensure that their candidates emerged winners, even with clear objections from all other aspirants and no election took place. “We plead with the NWC to wade into this matter before it snowballs into a major crisis. The PDP presidential candidate and other statutory bodies should as a matter of urgency, call the committee to order for the survival of the party. “The ad hoc list sent to Lagos was skewed in favour of the governorship candidate fingered in these sharp practices.”
