The Kaduna State Deputy Chief of Staff in the office of the Deputy Governor, James Kanyip, has distanced himself from a report going round that the Kaduna State All Progressives Congress governorship candidate, Uba Sani, nominated him as his running mate. In a statement obtained by The PUNCH on Saturday from the Special Assistant, Media and Communication, Office of the Deputy Governor, Peter Ibrahim calls on members of the public to disregard such information. He explained that the Kanyip was not aware that he had been nominated as the running mate of Senator Uba Sani, and would, therefore, like to disassociate himself from the rumour. “Kanyip believes that Senator Uba Sani and the Party will make their choice at the appropriate time and make such selection public,” he noted. He thanked the party members for their good wishes, but advised them to refrain from spreading unsubstantiated stories capable of undermining the cohesion in the party. Copyright PUNCH.
