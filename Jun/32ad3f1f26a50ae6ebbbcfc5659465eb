Proprietor of  Topdeal College, Dr. Oladeji Akinola, has called on stakeholders in the sports sector to support the development and growth of sporting activities in schools. Akinola said this at the maiden inter-house sport competition of the school which was held at the LASUSTECH campus, Ikorodu. He also complained that sport was not taken seriously in the education sector. ‘‘Stakeholders really need to do a lot. They need to support sports with equipment and facilities. They need to make sports a priority for young and talented boys and girls. Akinola stated that the essence of sports was to enhance a balanced performance between the body and the brain. ‘‘Today’s event is to make us realise the importance of sports in the academic environment. Students are not supposed to be restricted to the four walls of the classroom. As you can see, we have other schools competing in the inter-house sports; it is valuable and essential that sport is taken seriously in our academic atmosphere”. ‘‘There ought to be a balance between the body and the brain. You know sporting enhances the psychomotor neurons. This is what we hope to achieve. ‘‘Sport is not taken seriously in the education sector. Public schools are still doing better because of the large compounds they usually have.’’ The Chairman of the occasion and patron of Green House, Mr Jones Aboh, urged the students to be diligent in their studies adding that there was no shortcut to success. “I want to advise our dear students that there is no shortcut to success. You have to be diligent and hardworking to make Topdeal proud. Remember that you are the future of tomorrow and that one day the baton of leadership will be passed unto you”.  Copyright PUNCH.
