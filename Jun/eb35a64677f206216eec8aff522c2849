Singer, Oladapo Oyebanjo, aka D’banj, recently celebrated his 42nd birthday in grand style on Thursday, June 9, 2022. The event, at which he hosted friends, colleagues and family, took place at the EbonyLife Place, Victoria Island, Lagos. As part of the celebration, the birthday boy announced one Abuja-based Joseph Victor as the winner of his N1m cash giveaway for the ‘Cream De La Cream Bid Competition’. The finalists of the recently concluded Nigerian Idols competition, such as Progress, Zadok, Esther, Jordan and Banty, also gave an energetic performance to celebrate D’banj, who was one of the judges on the show. Apparently excited, the singer, who was dressed in a glittering brown outfit, could be seen grinning as he cut his birthday cake graciously, with his wife, Lineo, by his side, as the crowd spelt his name, ‘D-b-a-n-j’. Guests at the event included Wande Coal, Ice Prince, Ikechukwu, Ycee, IK Osakioduwa, Frank Edoho, Beverly Osu, Larry Gaga and Skibii.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
