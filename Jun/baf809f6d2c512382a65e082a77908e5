Super Eagles duo, Joe Aribo and Calvin Bassey, have been named in the 2021/22 Scottish Premier League team of the season after their outstanding performances for Glasgow Rangers last season, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Bassey was named at left-back while his compatriot Aribo was among the three midfielders listed in the squad. The 22-year-old defender was a revelation last season for the Gers and he performed remarkably well not only in the league but in their deep runs in cup competitions at home and abroad. He completes the defence line that comprises his club captain James Tavernier at right-back, Cameron Carter-Vickers from Celtic and Heart of Midlothian’s Stephen Kingsley. Aribo also had a fine season for the Gers in midfield, scoring stunning goals against Eintracht Frankfort, Ross County, Livingston, Hearts and St. Mirren among others. In attack, Celtic duo Jota and Kyogo Furuhashi were flanked by Regan Charles-Cook from Ross County. Both Aribo and Bassey are currently on international duty with Nigeria and were part of the team that defeated Sierra Leone 2-1 in Thursday’s 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Abuja. They are expected to feature for the Eagles when they face Sao Tome and Principe at the 45,000 – capacity Grand Stade de Agadir in southern Morocco next Monday. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
