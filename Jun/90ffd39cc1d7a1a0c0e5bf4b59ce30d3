Liverpool have been informed by Napoli president Aurelio de Laurentiis that a €100m bid would land them Victor Osimhen. A month ago, Victor Osimhen was declared as being open to a move to the Premier League. The Nigerian’s agents were “given the green light” to market him to teams in England with it reported that he only wants teams able to offer Champions League football. Corriere dello Sport now claims that Napoli president de Laurentis that has told the likes of Liverpool and Bayern Munich that they must pay £86m (€100m) to sign Osimhen. Osimhen, 23, is a fearless player and his heart and goalscoring ability would no likely appeal to Liverpool. The Reds are set to lose both Divock Origi and Sadio Mane this summer and both offer Jurgen Klopp a physical presence in the box and the ability to play a direct style of play. The former Ligue 1 striker started 26 games in all competitions for Napoli last term and directly contributed in 24 goals (18 goals and 6 assists). The 21-capped international has scored 10 goals and provided 6 assists for Nigeria thus far. He missed the AFCON due to injury and will not be taking part in this year’s World Cup as the Super Eagles failed to qualify. What Osimhen can offer Liverpool is a route to goal that not many are able to. He’s able to bully defenders and force them to make mistakes that they wouldn’t with a more tricky, nuanced attacker like Diogo Jota. Meanwhile,  Corriere dello Sport reported that Manchester United have requested for information on a possible Osimhen move to Old Trafford multiple times. Last season, United ‘s top scorer was Ronaldo, who scored 24 goals in all competitions. After him, compatriot, Fernandes, found the net 10 times. For goals, Erik ten Hag cannot over-rely on a 37-year-old centre forward next season and the Dutch manager needs to sign a youngster like Osimhen.
