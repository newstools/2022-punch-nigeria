Nigerian singer and songwriter, Tiwa Savage, has stated that she is not just looking for any other man but one that should be able to match her financial capabilities. The award-winning songstress stated this while performing for her fans at a concert in the United States. She said, “So I was telling my stylist, Tokunbo, it’s not that I am just looking for a guy that has money, because I have money too. Period! I have my own money too. If you do anyhow, I would get into my Lambo and [leave]. “All I’m saying is we’ve got to match our energy, you’ve got to match my energy. So from now on, we are looking for someone to add to our funds. Period!” Between 2013 and 2018, Tiwa Savage was married to music producer, Tokunbo Balogun, popularly known as TeeBillz, which produced a son, Jamil Balogun. Since the marriage ended in a messy divorce, the singer has been romantically linked with colleagues Wizkid and Naira Marley. She was also rumoured to have dated Davido’s late friend, Habeeb Uthman, aka Obama DMW among others. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
