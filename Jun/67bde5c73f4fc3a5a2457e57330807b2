The Edo State Police Command has said that the assailant, who inflicted a cut on an Igbo trader with a machete at the New Benin Market, Benin, early Saturday morning, is unknown and may likely be mentally unstable. Law and order broke down on Saturday morning after the attack, as hundreds of angry youths mainly traders at the market went on a rampage in protest. A viral video on social media showed angry youths beating the suspect and destroying goods in the market. But reacting to the development, the Edo Command spokesman, SP Chidi Nwabuzor, said the victim did not die as being speculated. In a press statement, the Nwabuzor said the unidentified assailant used cutlass to inflict bodily injuries on his victim, whose name was given as Mr Anthony Jibunor.  Copyright PUNCH.
