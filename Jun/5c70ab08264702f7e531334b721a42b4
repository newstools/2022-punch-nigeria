The lawmaker representing Ede-North/Ede-South/Egbedore/Ejigbo Federal Constituency in Osun State at the House of Representatives, Bamidele Salam on Wednesday, held a protest walk against insecurity in Nigeria. Salam, who was dressed in black, walked barefooted from the Unity Fountain in the Maitama area of the Federal Capital Territory to the National Assembly Complex. The lawmaker lamented that terrorists and other criminal gangs are killing and maiming, with many Nigerians abducted remaining in captivity, while the political elite are busy with electioneering towards the 2023 general election. Salam decried that the Senate and the House have passed several resolutions that the Executive arm of the Federal Government, led by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had allegedly failed to implement. He particularly decried that the government had failed to rescue the kidnapped passengers on the Abuja-Kaduna that was attacked by terrorists about three months ago, despite threats issued by their abductors. The lawmaker wrote on his placard, “President Muhammadu Buhari, please do more to secure freedom for the Kaduna train abductees and other citizens in captivity.”       Copyright PUNCH.
