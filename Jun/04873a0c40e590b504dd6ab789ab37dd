The National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party on Tuesday presented Certificates of Return to the 26 state governorship candidates for the 2023 general elections, while the governorship candidates of Kano and Ebonyi States await theirs due to legal issues arising from the primaries. The governorship candidates emerged after the party’s primaries were conducted across the country on May 25 and 26, 2022. The certificate presentation was witnessed by PDP state governors, the chairman of the PDP Board of Trustees, Walid Jibrin, members of the party’s National Working Committee and critical stakeholders among others. Speaking after the presentation, the presidential candidate of the party, Atiku Abubakar, said the event indicated that the party is the one that Nigerians are waiting for. The party’s National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, said the party at the moment has only 13 governors; stating that such number is not good for the PDP. Speaking on behalf of others, the party’s governorship candidate in Ogun State Oladipupo Adebutu, said, “We still have many odds to cross and we are not perturbed by the job ahead because we are driven by the need to set our people free from the shackles of misgovernance. “We take this as a challenge to work harder and we are particularly grateful to our people and the party for the platform. The PDP has given us this opportunity to go forward and rescue our respective states.” Three serving PDP governors, who are also candidates for the 2023 governorship race and were presented with certificates of return, included Governors Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State, Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State and Seyi Makinde of Oyo State.
