The leadership of Traditional Religion Worshippers Association, Osun State, on Wednesday, warned politicians against fomenting trouble during the forthcoming governorship poll in the state. The group said whoever that foments trouble during the election would face the wrath of Sango and Ogun, calling on the stakeholders to shun violence in the overall interest of the state. This was contained in a statement signed by the TRWASO President, Dr Oluseyi Atanda, in commemoration of his first anniversary in office as the leader of the group. Atanda, who admonished other religious groups in the state to also begin prayers to ward off violence, said politicians and their supporters must be law-abiding and refrain from acts that could jeopardise peace. The statement read in part, “As we approach the climax of political interplay in Osun, we as spiritualists will continue to pray to God Almighty and make supplications to the terrestrial to have a peaceful electioneering outing. “Let me state that it is likely that some desperate politicians will attempt a do or die approach and attempt to set Osun on fire, God Olodumare will not allow this to happen. “I want to enjoin all other religious groups to embark on prayers for a peaceful transition in Osun and admonish trouble makers to stop, otherwise they will incur the wrath of Sango and Ogun. Osun is peaceful and we want peace for all.” While reviewing activities of the group in the last one year, Atanda said his administration has strengthened its local government branches, while work has been progressing on the secretariat complex of the organisation.
