Personnel of the Nigeria Police Force disrupted a protest embarked on by the families of the kidnapped Abuja-Kaduna train passengers on Friday. Terrorists had on March 28 attacked the Abuja-Kaduna train, leading to the death of eight passengers while several others were kidnapped. The families had since the incident been pleading with the Federal Government to rescue their loved ones being held captive by the terrorists. The families gathered at the Unity Fountain armed with placards with inscriptions like, ‘The victims are dying in captivity’, ‘Mr President, please help us’, ‘Our blood pressure keep rising everyday’, ‘We hardly sleep with our two eyes closed’, among others. They had anticipated to march to the National Assembly but were intercepted by policemen on their way where they were sent packing by the policemen. The policemen had claimed they were not notified before embarking on the protest. Speaking to Saturday PUNCH, One of the family members, Abdulmumin Mohammed, bemoaned the actions of the policemen, adding that they were supposed to show empathy. He expressed dissatisfaction at the pace of the government to rescue the abducted passengers, urging them to hasten up their efforts. Mohammed said, “The policemen are supposed to show empathy. They are supposed to join us in this struggle, but out of their insensitivity they decided to do otherwise. It is a pity. Our loved ones had been in captivity for over 60 days; they are still there. Most of them are not in healthy conditions. We need the government to expedite action on whatever they are doing. The victims are dying and we are also not enjoying ourselves back home.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
