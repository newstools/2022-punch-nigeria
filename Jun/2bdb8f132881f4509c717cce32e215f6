Influential policy think-tank, Nextier SPD, has attributed continued terrorism in the country to inadequate involvement of communities despite the National Action Plan for Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism. The action plan was unveiled then by the Office of the National Security Adviser at the instance of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to provide a policy basis for engaging with the challenges of violent extremism in Nigeria. The document identified the core constituencies to focus on women and girls, families, schools, community leaders, faith-based organisations, health/social workers, civil society organisations, media and social media influencers, artists and social mobilisers, political leaders, private sector (and markets), policing and civil-military relations. Researchers at Nextier, in its weekly policy report, authored by Dr Ben Nwosu and Dr Ndu Nwokolo, noted that while community engagement remains a core point of implementation for any programme of prevention or countering of violent extremism, “the level of community involvement, which ought to be the centre of actions to prevent and counter extremism, is inadequate despite the National Action Plan. “With such a lack of action, it is no surprise that violent extremism is increasing across the country. It has moved from known religious leanings to economic, political, cultural and even extreme ideological positions.” Nextier further posited that “systematic prevention through coordinated intelligence sharing and safe spaces for discursive interaction still lacks policy support.” Copyright PUNCH.
