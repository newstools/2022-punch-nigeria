Oil and gas firm, Shell, has inaugurated the second and final phase of its comprehensive health care projects for Oloibiri and other communities in Ogbia Local Government area of Bayelsa State. Speaking at the inauguration event, Managing Director, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited and Country Chair, Shell Companies in Nigeria, Osagie Okunbor, described the dual-phased suite of health projects in Oloibiri as a reinforcement of the commitment of the oil major to the health and wellbeing of its hosts and Nigerians as a whole. Okunbor said, “The projects are to serve as a reference point for sustainable primary health care delivery, which is the foundation for the attainment of the Universal Health Coverage as prescribed by the World Health Organisation.” According to him, “Oloibiri holds an important place because when the narration of Nigeria’s oil and gas journey is told, it will always be mentioned that here, in 1958, Shell Nigeria made the first commercial find of hydrocarbons. Shell companies in Nigeria, therefore, share a momentous tie with the Oloibiri community and it is our desire to leave impactful memories here.” The phase two of the Shell Oloibiri health programme includes the Oloibiri Health Campus at Oloibiri Town; the Drug Distribution Centre at Emeyal II; a 400-metre Oloibiri access road to the health campus, and the Ogbia Safe Maternal and Infant Care Programme.” Phase one of the programme was inaugurated in 2019 to provide universal health coverage for Oloibiri where Shell’s oil and gas exploration began in Nigeria over 60 years ago. The delivery of the projects was to fulfil Shell’s commitments in commemoration of Nigeria’s centenary held in 2014.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
