The Independent National Electoral Commission has deployed additional 209 registration machines to the five South-East states, Lagos and Kano as the deadline for the Continuous Voter Registration draws to an end. The commission said the decision was in response to the unprecedented surge in the number of citizens that wish to register as voters. INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said these in a statement on Friday in Abuja. According to him, the commission was aware of the challenges faced by citizens across the country, hence the deployment. Okoye said in some states, the sudden turnout of prospective registrants is overwhelming. He said, “Consequently, the commission convened an urgent meeting with all the Resident Electoral Commissioners (yesterday Thursday 9 June 2022) to review the situation so that eligible Nigerians who wish to register are able to do so. “The necessity to urgently deploy more voter enrolment machines to ease the congestion at the registration centres was identified as a priority. “In response, the commission has immediately released additional 209 machines deployed mainly to the five South Eastern States, Lagos and Kano where the pressure is most acute.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
