The Primate, Church of Nigeria Anglican Communion, Most Reverend Henry Ndukuba, has stated that Nigeria is slowly sliding into anarchy. Ndukuba made this known in a press conference on Monday where he condemned the attack on Saint Francis Catholic Church, Owa-Luwa Street, Owo Local Government Area, Ondo State. The Sunday attack on the church in Owo, the hometown of the state governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, left many parishioners dead and several others injured. Speaking in the televised conference, Ndukuba said, “One thing we must get clear is that Nigeria is slowly gliding and sliding into anarchy. “We’re in a situation in which such things happen and nobody is arrested, nothing is done, and nobody is brought to book. Instead, people and individuals will have the occasion of speaking so boldly and freely in Tik Tok and other social media platform, threatening individuals, communities, and even tribes. “We do not encourage labelling any group of people as being evil but our system. Nigeria is a nation with rule, government, leadership, law, and constitution, and we are demanding that our leaders must rise up to the occasion to secure the lives and property of citizens in Nigeria. “Nobody has the right to be killed dn the place of his or her worship.” Copyright PUNCH.
