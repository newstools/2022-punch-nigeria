The Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr Orji Uzor Kalu, has been announced as the Director-General of the Ahmad Lawan Central Campaign Organisation. Lawan who is the Senate President and Chairman of the National Assembly is running for the office of the Nigeria President. At a meeting held in Abuja on Thursday and well attended by members, the Chairmen of eight committees of the campaign organisation were equally announced. The team met behind closed doors to fine-tune strategies and consolidate on the gains made so far. Lawan’s team led by Kalu is expected to strengthen the campaign organization and build a stronger cohesion that would deliver the All Progressives Congress ticket to the Lawan during the presidential primary and ultimately lead him to victory in the general election.
