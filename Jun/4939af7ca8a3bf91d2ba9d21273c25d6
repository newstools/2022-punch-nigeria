The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has urged stakeholders in the built sector to comply with physical planning laws in order to reduce cases of building collapse in the state. The governor stated this on Wednesday in his address at a stakeholders’ engagement organised by the Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority on the benefits of voluntary compliance to physical planning permit laws. Sanwo-Olu, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Mrs Folasade Jaji, noted that LASPPPA has been working with relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government as well as stakeholders to achieve more sustainable communities. He said, “This stakeholders’ engagement seeks to address physical planning regulations concerns of all players in the built industry and spur the development of workable solutions and ideas that will engender voluntary compliance to the state physical planning laws thereby promoting citizens’ ownership of the regulations for effective enforcement. “As a matter of fact, voluntary compliance costs less for both the applicants and government because applicants will not have to pay penalty fees for failure to obtain planning permits or for non-compliance to PPP regulations and the most important advantage of voluntary compliance is that it reduces the incidence of building collapse, thereby saving lives, property and economic resources of Lagosians.” Sanwo-Olu also advised stakeholders to embrace voluntary compliance and report physical development infractions.
