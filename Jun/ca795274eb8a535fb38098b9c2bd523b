British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will face a vote of no-confidence in the House of Commons on Monday. This comes after investigations revealed that the Prime Minister had participated in several gatherings that breached the country’s pandemic lockdown rules between 2020 and 2021. On Monday, Backbench chief, Sir Graham Brady, announced that 54 members of Parliament have written to him, seeking a vote of no-confidence against the Prime Minister, Daily Mail reports. “The threshold of 15% of the parliamentary party seeking a vote of confidence in the leader of the Conservative Party has been exceeded. “The votes will be counted immediately afterwards. An announcement will be made at a time to be advised. Arrangements for the announcement will be released later today,” the Member of Parliament wrote in a statement. The PUNCH had reported that public outcry over the so-called “partygate” scandal had left Johnson fighting for political survival. Although he denied any wrongdoing, several MPs, including those from his Conservative Party, had publicly called for his resignation. While he has apologised in parliament for the series of illegal gatherings, Johnson has, however, vowed to fight on in office. Several allies have also expressed support for the embattled PM, including Michael Gove, the Minister for Levelling-Up, Housing and Communities, who vowed to vote in support for his boss. “I’ll be voting for Boris this evening. The PM got the big decisions right on Brexit and Covid,” he tweeted on Monday. “We need to focus now on defending Ukraine, driving levelling-up and generating growth. We need to move past this moment and unite behind Boris to meet these challenges.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
