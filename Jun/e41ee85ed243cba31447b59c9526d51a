Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has stated that the Federal Government will continue to stand against evil. Osinbajo, who is also a presidential aspirant under the All Progressives Congress, made this known in a statement on Sunday, as he condemned the attack on St Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State. The incident which led to loss of lives, happened in the church, which is less than 200 meters away from the Palace of Olowo of Owo. The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), while reacting to the incident, had earlier noted that the country will not surrender to wicked people. Backing Buhari’s statement, Osinbajo said, “I join President Muhammadu Buhari to condemn in strongest terms, the atrocious killing of worshippers Sunday at the St Francis Catholic Church, Owa-luwa Street, Owo Kingdom, in Ondo State. “This saddens inexplicably, and I mourn the dead from this very unfortunate event. Also, my thoughts and my prayers go to the victims and their families, the Catholic Church, and the government of Ondo state. “We will not cower to the whims of elements who lurk in darkness to unleash inconceivable wickedness on our citizens. We will keep standing against evil and Nigeria will win. “As the President has charged, emergency agencies are to swing into action to bring succor to the wounded. “We stand in utter solidarity with the people of Owo and Ondo state in this terrible moment.” Copyright PUNCH.
