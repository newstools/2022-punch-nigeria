An ally of Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, Hon. Vincent Dike has dumped the ruling All Progressives Congress. Dike, who is the National Coordinator of Umahi’s Fans International, said he left the party as a consequence of intimidation and imposition of aspirants by the powers that be in the state. A source, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity, said the former coordinator of Edda North Development Centre in the Afikpo South Local Government Area of the state, was allegedly asked to drop his ambition to contest for the Afikpo South-East state constituency in the 2023 general election. This had pitched him against the party, the source added. The source further said Dike had joined the Labour Party and would pursue his aspiration in the party. In his resignation letter dated May 23, 2022, and addressed to his Ward Chairman, Dike said, “I am, with utmost respect and appreciation, do hereby wish to inform you that after due consultation with my ward members, family members and friends, I have decided to resign my membership of the APC with effect from May 23, 2022, due to ill-treatment meted on me by the State Chairman. “I sincerely wish to appreciate the Governor of Ebonyi State, Chief David Umahi, the incoming President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, for his developmental strides in the entire state. I will always support your Excellency’s political aspirations.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
