The candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in Ondo North Senatorial District in the 2023 election, Adetokunbo Modupe, has stated that the attack on St Francis Catholic Church, Owaluwa, Owo, Ondo State, was an indication of the near collapse of Nigeria’s security infrastructure. He joins a long list of Nigerians who have condemned the Sunday attack on Christian worshippers noting that it was a cause for concern for critical stakeholders to ensure the safety of lives and properties of the people. Modupe’s comments were contained in a statement signed by his Head of Media and Public Communications, Wale Obanigba, where he added that the government had failed in its responsibility to protect its citizens. The statement read in part, “The primary responsibility of government is the security and welfare of the people, therefore, it is a general failure of government when such cannot be guaranteed. “The reoccurring events of killings and kidnapping of people in the heart of Owo town in recent time is an indication of the near collapse of our security architecture, and I, therefore, call on relevant security agencies and government at all levels to rejig the security architecture for better performance.” Modupe, commiserating with the Catholic Church in Owo and the families of the victims, also urged security agencies to hunt down the perpetrators of the attack to ensure they are made to face the law.
