A study conducted by T4 Education in collaboration with EdTech Hub has said Tech limitations, particularly the high cost of data, and education assessment methods failed to accurately gauge student progress and identify learning losses created by COVID-19 The study which was conducted in Nigeria and other low-and middle-income countries maintained that effective EdTech tools and techniques for progress monitoring in an online environment were essential if governments were to address learning gaps that have widened during the pandemic. The report, titled ‘Effective assessment and progress monitoring in an online environment’, provided a vital insight into how tools and techniques for monitoring progress need to be improved if governments are to address learning gaps widened during the pandemic. The study was undertaken in six countries including Nigeria, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Philippines, and South Africa and was based on focus group discussions with teachers and school leaders in each country. A statement by the organisations said the report highlighted how consistent access to electricity proved a big challenge for teaching students and tracking their progress during the pandemic, as was a lack of access to devices. Executive Director of EdTech Hub, Verna Lalbeharie, said, “The extreme challenge placed on teachers in Nigeria and around the world to provide continuity of learning for students in a long-term emergency environment is something from which we must learn.” ‘‘There is no piece of technology that can replace the art of good teaching.”  Copyright PUNCH.
