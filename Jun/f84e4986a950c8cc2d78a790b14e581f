The Yemi Osinbajo Campaign Organisation’s top campaigner, Richard Akinnola, has congratulated the former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu, on his early lead and “presumed victory” at the ongoing All Progressives Congress presidential primary. So far, Tinubu has obtained over 890 votes to lead his closest contenders, Rotimi Amaechi and Yemi Osinbajo. Amaechi has obtained 175 votes while Osibanjo polled 126. On his Facebook page on Wednesday morning, Akinnola said though it appeared Tinubu would emerge victorious at the end of the exercise, he was proud of his support for the vice president. He wrote, “Congratulations, Asiwaju Tinubu, the presumed winner of the primaries. In any contest, there must be a winner. However, I’m very proud of my choice of support in the person of Prof. Yemi Osinbajo. “I have no iota of regret over my support for him. It was a privilege to play a pivotal role for him during the process. “I would gladly do it over and over again. It’s a matter of conviction. And for all our supporters and other volunteers who worked assiduously, day and night on the PYO project, God bless you all. I’m so proud of all of you. As l often say, God rules in the affairs of men and He has a purpose for what just happened. Understandably, many of you are dispirited and downcast but do not let your heart be troubled. There must be a reason God allowed this. “It may not be manifest to us now but later as He is all-knowing. I’m unfazed, unbowed and VERY PROUD of PYO. Our supporters, abeg, make una shake it off. No be say person die😂Life goes on. No yawa.” Meanwhile, the Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters, Senator Babafemi Ojudu, has hailed Osinbajo as counting and sorting continues at the Eagle Square, the venue of the APC presidential primary. “PYO you remain my hero for life.
