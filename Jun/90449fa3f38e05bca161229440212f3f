The Onisabe of Igbobi-Sabe, Lagos Mainland, Oba Owolabi Adeniyi, has asked the South-West and other parts of the country to prioritise security. The monarch spoke in reaction to the recent massacre of innocent worshippers at the St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State, on June 5, 2022. Oba Adeniyi stated that a situation such as the massacre called for concerted action, as security is not the exclusive responsibility of anyone or group of persons, but a joint responsibility. He said, “When you have a problem like this in the western world, it is not the business of the policemen alone. They combine all forces to face the threat. So, I am appealing to our government because the usual trend is for the people to blame the Obas and other traditional rulers and call us all sorts of names. “They even curse us and accuse us of being compromised, but you cannot blame them because they are talking out of pain. That is why I am speaking up. Perhaps if every Oba and traditional ruler speaks up, things would change. As you know, Obas don’t have any serious power; we only console ourselves when we say that we are the government because the truth is that we are not.” The Oba, who was dismayed over the matter, stated that such a massacre in broad daylight could not be overlooked. “If we keep quiet, it is even more dangerous. Since that incident, I have not been myself. I even shed tears after seeing a graphic picture of what happened,” he said. The monarch, who had cut short his palace Gelede Rebirth Celebration that Sunday, stated that he would rally and galvanise all Obas in the Lagos State Council of Obas to take up the issue.
