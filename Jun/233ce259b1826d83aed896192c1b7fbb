In this episode of So This Happened, we reviewed the attack by gunmen on the St Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State. We also reviewed the comments made by the former governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima, about the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo. He described Osinbajo as a nice man, who should be selling ice-cream and popcorn; as nice men make nasty leaders. Lastly, we reviewed the death of a Nigerian man who was killed by a drunk driver abroad. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
