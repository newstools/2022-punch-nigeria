The former National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, Chief Victor Umeh, has defected to the Labour Party. His defection is coming six days after he lost the APGA ticket to a member of the House of Representatives, Dozie Nwankwo, who currently represents the Anoacha/Dunukofia/Njikoka Federal Constituency. Umeh, who was the National Chairman of APGA for eight years, narrowly lost the APGA ticket for the Anambra Central Senatorial zone to Nwankwo. Umeh is currently contesting the ticket of the Labour Party for the Anambra Central Senatorial zone for the 2023 general election. Details later… Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
