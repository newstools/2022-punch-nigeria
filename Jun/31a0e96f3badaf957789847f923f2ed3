The Emir of Kano, Alhaji Ado Bayero, on Tuesday said malnutrition, which has been threatening the country for decades, could be addressed through the use of rich and multi-vitamin consumables. According to a statement made available to The PUNCH on Wednesday, Bayero spoke during a visit of the management team of Checkers Custard to his palace in Kano. The Emir was quoted as saying that, “As we all know, we are living at a time when children suffer from malnutrition right from birth or immediately after birth due to poor diet by pregnant mothers or inability to provide the children with highly nutritional food. “We hope you sustain the tempo at providing more products that will bridge the malnutrition gap so that we can have more healthy children, the breastfeeding mothers, the expectant mothers and the society at large. “I was also informed about your gesture during your last visit to the palace, it is highly commendable and I wish you more growth.” The Branch Head, Northern Nigeria, Checkers Africa, Ratheesh Nambiar, was also quoted as saying that said members of the team were at the palace to pay homage and introduce to their products to the traditional ruler. “I use this golden opportunity to appreciate your royal highness for your unprecedented prowess in the discharge of your royal duties and wise manner by which you have rallied round the people of Kano in unity and purposefulness.”
