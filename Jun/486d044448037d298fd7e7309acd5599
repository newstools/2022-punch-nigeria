The casualty figure of a family of 12, found unconscious in a room in their house in Obinze community, Owerri West Local Government Area of Imo State, on Monday morning, has risen to six. The sixth victim, who was the wife of the head of the family, Kingsley Oguzie, died on Monday night at Imo Specialist Hospital, Umuguma, Owerri, where they were rushed to for emergency medical attention. While Oguzie, his son, a two-year-old child, and another adult were confirmed dead upon arrival at the hospital, another person died hours later before his wife died late Monday. Our correspondent, who visited the hospital on Tuesday, was told today that Mrs. Oguzie lost the battle on Monday night. Our correspondent saw some of the victims still on life support machines while a few had slightly regained consciousness. While relatives loitered around the hospital, medical personnel were attending to the victims. The family house and the village, Obokwu, in Obinze community, were deserted when our correspondent visited the place. While the family’s house was locked without any neighbor or kinsman in sight, no member of the community agreed to speak to our correspondent except one man, who only told our correspondent, “policemen just came here now, locked the compound, and left.” Copyright PUNCH.
