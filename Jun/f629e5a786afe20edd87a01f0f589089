The Registrar of the National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders Academy, Mr Francis Omotosho, has said that the disunity of Nigeria is negatively affecting the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area. Omotosho, who spoke on Tuesday in Lagos, said the there were so many barriers affecting trade in Nigeria. He lamented lack of commitment on the side of the government to eradicate existing trade barriers, noting that there were no adequate trade infrastructures in the country. Omotosho also said that for Nigeria to effectively benefit from AfCFTA, there was a need for the border posts to be revived, adding that the rail lines should be made to work optimally. “Yes, the unity of Nigeria is affecting AfCFTA. Africa is the continent and Nigeria is leading the continent made up of 55 countries. In terms of trade, Nigeria is leading because we have the highest population and the highest landmark. In the North American continent, the United States of America is leading and it has 50 countries and they are united, which is why you can see that trade is moving smoothly. “Canada has the highest landmark, anyway. When you come to Asia, China is leading, and there are over 49 countries. China is united with a large landmark and population.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
