Former Osun State Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Kolapo Alimi, has defected to the Peoples Democratic Party. Upon defection, Alimi, it was learnt, was appointed as the Deputy Director General of Adeleke Campaign Organisation, the body charged with the responsibility of securing victory for the PDP candidate in the July 16 Osun governorship poll, Senator Ademola Adeleke. Alimi, a lawyer, served as commissioner in the state cabinet during the two terms of ex-Osun governor, Rauf Aregbesola. The Erin Osun-born politician, who until his defection was the Secretary, The Osun Progressives, a faction in Osun All Progressives Congress backed by the Minister of Interior, Aregbesola, was one of the fiercest critics of the incumbent governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, who he accused of sidelining those that worked for his victory. When it was recently rumoured that he had defected to the PDP, Alimi, who said there were talks, stated that when he was ready to leave, it would be announced. Alimi, in a text message to our correspondent on Saturday, confirmed his defection to the PDP. The Director of Media and Publicity of Osun PDP, Oladele Oluwabamiji, also confirmed Alimi’s defection and his subsequent appointment as Deputy Director General of Adeleke Campaign Organisation. Oladele said, “His defection to PDP is confirmed and he has also been appointed Deputy Director General, Adeleke campaign organisation.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
