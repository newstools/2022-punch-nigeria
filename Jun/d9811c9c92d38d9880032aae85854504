Veteran filmmaker, Wale Fanu, is dead. The death of the filmmaker was announced by his associate, Jide Bisayo, on Sunday. The 72-year-old veteran, who lived with sickle cell, was the managing director of one of the foremost production houses in Nollywood, Cinekraft. Announcing the death of the veteran filmmaker, Bisayo noted that Cinekraft contributed to the birth of Nollywood. Busayo wrote, “In the beginning while Nollywood was still an embryo, there was CINEKRAFT. Cinekraft in no small way contributed to the birthing of the nascent industry. “Behind Cinekraft administration and production management was one indefatigable, never tiring creative soul, my boss, Wale Fanu. Uncle Wales (as I like calling you), rest in the bosom of the Lord. “A titan has gone home indeed!” Though Busayo didn’t state the time or cause of death, Fanu was known as a sickle cell survivor. In an interview with The PUNCH in 2018, Fanu noted that the condition robbed him of certain experiences as a child. “It got so bad that my mother thought I was never going to get married. She tried to hide the truth of my condition from people. But to the glory of God, today I am married and have four children,” he had said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
