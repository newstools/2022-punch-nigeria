Thousands of Peoples Democratic Party supporters and well-wishers, on Friday, thronged the Sultan Abubakar International Airport in Sokoto to welcome the state governor, Aminu Tambuwal. The supporters, who had besieged the airport immediately after Friday prayer, around 2:30 pm, waited for hours before the governor arrived some few minutes before 6 pm. The enthusiastic crowd sang and danced as they joined the governor’s convoy to the city. Tambuwal, one of the top PDP presidential aspirants, had stepped down for former Vice President Atiku Abubakar at the convention venue and directed his supporters to vote for the former vice president. The development had been described by many as the game-changer that made Atiku clinch the party’s presidential ticket. The motorcade of the governor was still on the road leading to the government house almost two hours after arriving in the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
