Former President of the Senate, Anyim Pius Anyim, has condemned the massacre of Christians by gunmen at the St Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State on Sunday. In a statement issued on Sunday in Abuja by his media adviser, Sam Nwaobasi, Anyim said the killing of the worshippers during Sunday service was despicable, callous, as well as an assault on humanity and desecration of the Church of God. He wondered why the evil men could enter the sacred House of God to kill innocent and defenseless worshippers who had gone to commune with their creator. The former PDP presidential aspirant said he condemned the heinous murder “in the strongest term possible as despicable, barbaric, callous, evil and as an assault on humanity.” “I cannot understand why these evil men would carry out this dastardly act against defenceless citizens who had gone to the Holy Temple of the Lord Almighty to commune with their creator. “I call on the Ondo State Government and all the Security Agencies to go after these criminals, fish them out and make them face the law for the mindless murder of innocent citizens,” the statement read. Anyim prayed for the repose of the souls of those killed. He equally condoled with relations of the deceased. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
