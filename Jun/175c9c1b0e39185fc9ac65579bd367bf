The trial of Nice Omininikoron, the suspected killer of a 22-year-old fashion designer, Oluwabamise Ayanwole, could not go on at the Lagos High Court sitting at the Tafawa Balewa Square on Tuesday due to the absence of the defence counsel, Isaac Ezeawem. Omininikoron is facing four counts of conspiracy, rape, and murder of Ayanwole, who went missing after boarding a BRT vehicle driven by the defendant on Saturday, February 26. It was reported that she boarded the bus, which was going to Oshodi at Chevron Bus-Stop, Lagos Island. According to the prosecution, the offences are contrary to and punishable under sections 411, 223, 260 and 165 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. At the resumed trial on Tuesday, the prosecution, led by Dr Jide Martins, told the court that the defence lawyer, Isaac Ezeawem, informed him of his absence. He said, “The defence lawyer called me and said he was sick. I asked if he had written to the court to inform them. He apologised. I informed him we had a new date on Thursday, June 9, and he said he was aware. “I want it to be on record that there are three witnesses in court today. One came outside this jurisdiction and same witnesses that were in court at the last date when the defendant was not produced.” The counsel representing the victim’s family, Ayo Ademiluyi, was also present. Justice Sherifat Sonaike noted that the trial could not hold at the last date on June 1 because the defendant was not produced. She agreed with the prosecution on the new date. “I adjourn this case to 9th of June, 2022, in view of the absence of the defence counsel,” she added.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
