In furtherance of its commitment to engaging stakeholders in the development of the Nigerian oil and gas industry, Pacegate Energy Resources Limited recently held a one-day seminar to share insights on the application and monitoring of antiscalants as a means of preventing oilfield scaling. The event which had the theme, “Scale Inhibitor, Application, and Monitoring,” served as a platform for industry stakeholders to share innovative industry development, and supply chain updates, analyse global trends and discuss practical ways to apply and monitor scale inhibitions in the Nigerian oil and gas sector. The event was held in partnership with Canadian Energy Solutions, and Jacam Catalyst. Commenting on the development, the General Manager, Sales and Technical, PEARL, Franklin Oranusih, said, “Scale formation causes technical problems that lead to equipment damage and economic losses. “Preventing it relies on discussing and understanding the composition of the scale, appropriate scale inhibitor, and early pre-treatment.” However, the use of chemicals, acting as a scale inhibitor, has significantly proven to be the effective and economical approach to control scale deposition.” The Second Secretary Commercial and Trade Commissioner at the Deputy High Commission of Canada to Nigeria, Sonia Hukil, emphasised the need for strategic interaction and collaborations to promote the advancement of the Nigerian oil and gas industry.
