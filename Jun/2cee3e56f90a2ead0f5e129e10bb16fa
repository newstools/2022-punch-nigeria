The Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria has recovered over N7 billion out of the N48.3bn loans granted to over 200 estate developers and primary mortgage institutions in the country. While N6,462,286,052.87 was recovered from defaulting estate developers, N626,230,991.80 was repaid by PMIs, totalling N7,088,517,044.67. In addition, post-dated cheques amounting to N2,216,429,528.37 were reportedly issued by three estate developers in lieu of their loan repayment between September 2018 to December 2019. It further said the cheques could not be cleared because two of the developers completed their projects and the houses are being packaged for mortgage to National Housing Fund contributors, while the loan workout has been approved for the other developer to allow for mortgage creation to interested NHF subscribers. The FMBN disclosed these in response to a Freedom of Information request from The PUNCH. The bank in its letter jointly signed by FMBN Group Head, Corporate Communications, Lawan Sauri and Executive Director, Business Development and Portfolio Management, Kingsley Chukwuma, dated May 24, 2022, explained that the defunct Special Presidential Investigative Panel facilitated the recoveries. In the course of its work between September 14 and October 16, 2018, the bank said the SPIP met with 87 companies while 123 others failed to turn up. The letter titled, ‘Re: Freedom of Information request on the N48.3bn loans to PMIs, estate developers,’ read, “On the Bank’s efforts in recovering the outstanding debts, we have made sustained strides resulting in 29 non-performing loan accounts with a total exposure of N20,715,644,546.52 approved for closure. “This was as a result of the review and approval of exit proposals from the estate developers. Secondly, the Bank has taken over some funded projects (Tome Nigeria Limited, Skan Investments Limited and Hydraform Engineering Limited) from the developers in order to micro-manage the projects to completion to enable us to recover our investment on such projects.
