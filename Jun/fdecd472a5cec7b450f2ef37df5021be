Onaopemipo Adegoke is pleased to have won the maiden Squash Champions Challenge, insisting the tournament will boost his chances of breaking into the top 200 in the world in the coming months, The PUNCH reports. Adegoke beat Kehinde Samuel 3-1 (13-11, 11-7, 5-11, 11-6) in the final of the competition at the OTrafford Squash Club, Lagos on Saturday to emerge the winner of the tournament. The 23-year-old lost only one set during the four-day event in Lagos. Speaking with The PUNCH, Adegoke, who opted out of a squash event in South Africa to compete in Lagos, said the win meant everything to him. “I’m happy I stayed back to feature at the Champions Challenge because this win here means everything to me,” Adegoke, who became Nigeria’s undisputed No.1 squash player after his triumph, said. “I have spent most of the important moments in my career playing squash and I have never regretted it. This just adds to the success story.” Adegoke is hopeful more tournaments will be organised to keep a healthy competition among the athletes. “This is the first major competition in Nigeria and I believe with more events like this, squash will only get better and recognised more in the country.” Copyright PUNCH.
