A yet-to-be-identified man has been rescued during an attempt to commit suicide on the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge in Lagos State. The PUNCH gathered that the man left a destination in the state and went to the bridge where he attempted to jump into the water. It was learnt that passersby alongside the patrol team of the Lekki Concession Company quickly intervened and prevented the man from jumping into the water. A viral clip on social media showed the man resisting attempts by some good Samaritans and the patrol team to rescue him. The man was seen in the video shedding tears as no fewer than four persons consoled and encouraged him. “You can see promotion, your future is bright, it is ok. You are a man, cool down. Your future is bright, come let me find work for you,” a woman who was part of the rescue team, said as they discouraged him from making the attempt. Confirming the incident in a post on Instagram, the LCC said the quick intervention of its patrol team saved the young man’s life, adding that he was handed over to the police. The post read, “Thanks to the quick intervention of LCC patrol officers, a young man was saved from commiting suicide on Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge. He has been handed over to the police.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin, also confirmed the incident to our correspondent. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
