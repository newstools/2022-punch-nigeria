The Federal High Court sitting in Warri, Delta State, has fixed October 25, 2022 for commencement of trial in the lingering case of alleged terrorism leading to the death of no fewer than three persons and destruction of over 14 houses within Evwreni Kingdom in Ughelli North Local Government Area of the state. Among those alleged to have been killed in the recurring communal crisis sometime in March 2020 were Sylvester Adjogbe and Omoghene Akakor. Saturday PUNCH gathered that the commencement of the court trial which was scheduled for last Thursday could not be as the court did not sit until 12.00 pm when the Judge, Hon. Justice Effreti Abang, informed the counsels to both parties that he would only entertain fundamental human right cases at the day’s sitting, which led to the adjournment of the matter to October 25. In the suit No: FHC/WR/95C/2020 containing amended nine counts, including alleged terrorism and murder, the Ovie of Evwreni Kingdom, HRH Oghenekevwe Kumane, one Atiri Stephen and Kelly Omojugheri were billed to be arraigned before the court over the alleged charges. The monarch was visibly present in court at the aborted court session. Our correspondent gathered that the lawyers to the traditional ruler had at the last adjournment, promised to produce him in court to face the charges levelled against him.  Copyright PUNCH.
