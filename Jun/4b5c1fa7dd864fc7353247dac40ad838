A former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, has declared that the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, will defeat the Peoples Democratic Party candidate, Atiku Abubakar, in Adamawa State. Lawal stated that the Adamawa State chapter of the APC was ready to work to ensure Tinubu wins ahead of Abubakar, who hails from the state. He stated this on Thursday evening while speaking on a programme on Channels TV, noting that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), won against the former vice president in Adamawa at the 2019 presidential election. Lawal also boasted of the party’s reach within the state, adding that the APC in the state was ready to expend material and intellectual resources to ensure Tinubu’s victory. “We are there, and we are the ones from Adamawa who will deliver Bola Tinubu in the same way that we delivered Buhari while Atiku was contesting, in the same way, Adamawa delivered Goodluck Jonathan while Atiku was contesting, so it is not a new thing. “We have our tentacles all over the state; it is our state, and we know our tendencies, Bola Tinubu will win Adamawa State. “Whether he (Tinubu) makes it or not, only God knows, but we will work towards it, and we believe that we have the instruments, we have the resources – both material and intellectual – to deliver Bola Tinubu as the president,” Lawal stated.
