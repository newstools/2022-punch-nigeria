A worker with the Lagos Waste Management Authority, Rafiu Rahaman, has been arrested for faking his kidnap and demanding N5m ransom from his co-workers in Lagos State. This was contained in a statement by the state police spokesperson, Benjamin Hundeyin, on Friday. Hundeyin said after Rahaman faked his kidnapping, he travelled to Lugbe, Abuja, where he made a video of himself in captivity and sent it to one of his co- workers. The PPRO said Rahaman’s accomplice, Usman Sheidu, subsequently demanded N5m ransom and N150,000 was paid to him after extensive negotiation. He said, “Detectives of the State Criminal Investigation Department, Lagos, have arrested one Rafiu Rahaman, an employee of the Lagos Waste Management Authority in Lagos for faking his kidnap. “Rahaman, after faking his kidnap, travelled to Lugbe, Abuja, where he made a video of himself in captivity, which was sent to his co-worker. His accomplice Usman Sheidu, who demanded N5m ransom but got N150,000 after extensive negotiation has equally been arrested. “Investigation reveals that Usman Sheidu, who was arrested in Abuja, conspired with Rahaman to self-stage the kidnap and make the video that was sent to the co-workers for ransom.” Hundeyin said Usman, during interrogation, confessed to have shared the ransom equally with Rahaman and used his share in acquiring a generator and other items for himself. “Suspects will be arraigned in court at the conclusion of the investigations. The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi, while commending the detectives for a job well done, reassures Lagosians that perpetrators of crimes will not go undetected and unpunished,” the PPRO said.
