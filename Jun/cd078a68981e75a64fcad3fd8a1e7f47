The family of Harira Jubril, the pregnant woman who was killed alongside her four kids in Anambra on Sunday, May 22, 2022, has petitioned the Anambra State governor, Prof. Charles Soludo. The petition, titled, “Justice for Harira and her five children murdered by ‘unknown gunmen’ in Anambra State” had garnered over 11,955 signatures as of 9.46 pm on Saturday. A cousin to Jubril, Rashida Hamman, who started the petition, hosted on the global change platform, change.org, said the murder of Harira and her four children was an indication that there were no boundaries in terrorism. Hamman demanded that Soludo must, among all things, “bring the perpetrators to book and protect the lives and property of northern indigenes residing in the state and render financial assistance to my cousin, Jibril, who has relocated to Adamawa State based on this ugly incident.’’ She also urged the Adamawa State Government, Harira’s home state, to “acknowledge this incident and collaborate with the Anambra State government to secure the lives and property of Adamawa State indigenes residing in Anambra  state; provide support for Jibril to resettle in his homeland and provide him with adequate support to get through this difficult time;  and, condemn and bolster security measures to protect every Nigerian citizen.” Copyright PUNCH.
