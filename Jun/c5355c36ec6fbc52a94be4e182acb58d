A tech expert and co-founder of Venture Garden Group, Ademola Idowu, has urged the three tiers of government in the country to drive its administrative and social activities with technology and innovation products to allow sustainable growth within the tech ecosystem. He said providing access to knowledge and a level-playing field for the teeming youth population would solve the problem of unemployment, brain drain and untapped potential. Idowu, who made this known during the graduation of 125 trainees from the Garden Academy, a subsidiary of Venture Garden Group, added that the academy has the capacity and experience to train more than 10,000 youths if the needed facilities are made available for the youths by state governments. “With the graduation of this set that specialises in product analysis and quality assurance, we are showcasing to the government that we could solve problems of unemployment. “We want access to knowledge and employment democratised. If the government commit to automating 30-40 per cent of all its activities, we would have more than enough to provide jobs for the youths. We begin to export these talents to Africa and to the rest of the world.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
