A group of women in Owo, Ondo State, have reportedly laid curses on the attackers of the St Francis Catholic Church, Owo, which saw many killed and scores injured. The women were said to have performed traditional rites by invoking ancestral spirits to bring the perpetrators to justice, BBC Pidgin reports. The PUNCH reports that the gunmen attacked the Catholic Church in Owo on Sunday, June 5, throwing dynamite and shooting sporadically at congregants during a mass. At least 35 people were killed with scores injured in the attack. See photos:     Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
