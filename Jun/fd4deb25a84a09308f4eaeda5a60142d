The Resident Electoral Commissioner for the Independent National Electoral Commission in Osun State, Prof Abdulganiy Raji, on Monday, said the commission had taken delivery of fresh 333,000 Permanent Voter Cards. Raji made the disclosure in Osogbo while speaking with journalists on the sidelines of a sensitisation programme organised by the commission for community and religious leaders, as well as other stakeholders ahead of the 2022 governorship poll. He said the new PVCs received were for those who registered between June 2021 and March 2022; those who corrected their cards; those who lost their cards and those who did transfer. He said, “After the 2019 general elections, the commission had yet-to-be-collected 373,000 PVCs. “Out of that, roughly between 2,000 and 3,000 PVCs were collected since then. I can say about 370,000 plus PVCs have yet to be collected. In addition to that, we have now taken delivery of about 333,000 PVCs for those who registered between June 2021 and March 2022; those who corrected their cards; those who lost their cards and those who did transfer.” “These 333,000 PVCs and the old ones, 370,000, are at our local government offices. People should go to our local government offices to pick up their PVCs.” Continuing, Raji said the aim of the sensitisation was to ensure that all stakeholders collaborate with the commission towards a peaceful poll. He tasked the participants to return to their various communities and spread the message of peace. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
