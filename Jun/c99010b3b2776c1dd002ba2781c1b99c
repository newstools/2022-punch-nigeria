The Adamawa State Police Command has arrested an 18-year-old man over the murder of a 36-year-old nursing mother and her one-year-old child. The incident occurred at the Lamurde Local Government Area of the state. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Sulaiman Nguroje, said the suspect allegedly attacked the victim by the riverside, where she went to take her bath alongside her child. Suleiman said, “The Adamawa State Police Command on June 6, 2022, apprehended an 18-year-old suspect for the brutal murder of one Talatu Usman, 36, and her one-year-old child in Lamurde Local Government Area. “The victim was said to have resisted an attempt by the suspect to rape her, as he overpowered her and pressed her down into the water, where she died. “As if this was not enough, the suspect took the child, who was crying uncontrollably on the riverbank and pressed him into the water until he became lifeless. “On the strength of that, the suspect was arrested by the command operatives attached to Lamurde divisional police headquarters following a report received by the victim’s husband, Alh. Usman Abdul, who is distraught over the loss of his wife and child.” Nguroje said the state Commissioner of Police, Sikiru Akande, had ordered discreet investigation into the matter.
