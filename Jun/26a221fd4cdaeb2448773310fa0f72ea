A presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Rotimi Amaechi, has condemned the attack and killing of innocent worshippers at a church in Owo, Ondo State, on Sunday. Ameachi who is the immediate past Minister of Transportation said with the continuous attack on defenseless citizens, there was a need for the government and security agencies to step up intelligence gathering. Amaechi in a statement released by his media office on Sunday commiserated with the affected families, St Francis Xavier Catholic Church, the people of Owo Kingdom, and the Government of Ondo State. He described the event as “a terrible, absolutely vile and senseless murder of innocent citizens”. The former governor of Rivers State urged security agencies to collaborate and fish out the perpetrators, saying, “I feel so sad and livid that these criminals are so emboldened to carry out these barbaric attacks on the people in broad daylight. “Our security agencies have to put heads together and smoke out these monsters and ensure they are punished, immobilized, and totally flushed out. “They must also in partnership with our government, step up intelligence and work round the clock to nip such acts of terror in the bud. “May the souls of the departed rest in the bosom of the Lord. I also pray for the families, the church, the people, and the Government of Ondo State to find strength in the midst of the sorrow and pain,” Amaechi said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
