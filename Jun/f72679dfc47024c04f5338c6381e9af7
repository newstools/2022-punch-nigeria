Bandits have abducted the two wives and four daughters of a former Permanent Secretary, Zamfara State Ministry of Finance, Abubakar Bello. An indigene of the area, Auwalu Mohammed, said the bandits went to Bello’s residence in Furfuri village in the Bungudu Local Government Area of the state around 11pm last Sunday thinking that he was around. According to Mohammed, when the bandits searched everywhere and did not see him, they kidnapped his two wives and four daughters. Mohammed said, “I think the bandits were only targeting the former permanent secretary because when they arrived in the village, they didn’t touch anybody, but went straight to his house. “They fired many shots to scare people away and finally broke into the house and abducted his two wives and four daughters because he could not be seen.” Mohammed said the bandits later released the two wives and went away with the four daughters because the women could not make their way to the bandits’ camp. He said, “The bandits released the two wives because they could not trek to the bush despite severe beatings by the bandits. “They are currently receiving treatment at the Yariman Bakura Specialist Hospital, Gusau.” Efforts to speak to the former permanent secretary were not successful. The spokesperson for the state police command, SP Mohammed Shehu, could not be reached on his telephone line. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
