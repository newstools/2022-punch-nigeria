The Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, is currently meeting with the at least five governors of the All Progressives Congress as well as the National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu. The meeting comes just days after the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), met with the governors at the Council Chambers of the State House on Tuesday before leaving for Madrid, Spain. It also comes after the conclusion of the party’s screening for presidential aspirants by the John Odigie-Oyegun-led committee. Although the identities of the governors are still unknown, our correspondent confirmed that the meeting is taking place at the vice president’s official residence in Aguda House.
