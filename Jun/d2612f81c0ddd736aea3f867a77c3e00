The presidential candidate of the Labour Party has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission to extend the voter registration exercise across the country as the deadline for registration of new Permanent Voter Cards draws close. Obi made the call via his Twitter handle on Thursday stating that voter registration across the country and especially in the South East had been impeded by bureaucratic bottlenecks. INEC had earlier extended the deadline for online registration for new PVCs from May 31, 2022, to June 30, 2022. However, the electoral umpire maintained the deadline for all registrations on June 30. The former presidential aspirant under the Peoples Democratic Party called on INEC to facilitate a speedy registration of voters for them to be able to exercise their constitutional rights. “Information reaching me indicate that voter registration across Nigeria, more so in the South East, is dogged by inertia & bureaucratic bottlenecks. I respectfully call on [INEC] to facilitate speedy registration of Nigerians to enable them [to] exercise their voting rights,” Obi wrote. As the 2023 general elections draw close, many Nigerians have lamented the difficulty in getting their PVCs within the timeframe provided by INEC. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
