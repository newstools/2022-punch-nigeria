A civil society group, the United Nations Association of Nigeria, in line with its goals of addressing global challenges, has launched a fundraising event for the fulfillment of five key Sustainable Development Goals: people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership. In a press release made available to The PUNCH on Monday, UNAN reaffirmed its commitment to combating some of humanity’s greatest challenges such as poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace, and justice. The association described the move as a blueprint designed to achieve a better and sustainable future for all and to “enjoin all and sundry to take action with social responsibility for one another starting with disadvantaged areas and people in Lagos State.” Speaking on the sidelines of its upcoming 2022 UNAN DAY, the group’s President, Mrs Joan Agha, said, “We are already in the 7th year of this master plan since the UN declared the 17 SDGs in 2015. “Our role, therefore, is to solicit support from partners, collaborators, and benefactors in improving lives through SDGs 1, 2, 6, and 8 which state thus: No poverty, No hunger , Clean Water and Sanitation, Decent Work and Economic Growth.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
