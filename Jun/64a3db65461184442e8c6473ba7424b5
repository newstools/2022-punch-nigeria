The Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has said he is not an emperor by any chance barely 24 hours after a comment by a presidential aspirant and national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu. Tinubu had, on Thursday, while speaking to delegates of the APC in Ogun State, said Abiodun would not have become a governor without him (Tinubu). “Look at this one seated behind me, Dapo, he wouldn’t have become governor without my support,” Tinubu had stated. In a tweet posted to his verified Twitter page, @dabiodunMFR, a day after, Abiodun stated that he was not an emperor and his office as the governor of Ogun State was not a family inheritance. “I am not an emperor by any chance and this is not my family inheritance. “I am holding this position in trust for all the people of this state and I have vowed to be fair, just and equitable and this is the solemn agreement I made between the Almighty God and myself,” Dapo said.
