Men of the Ogun State Police Command have arrested one Wakilu Ogundairo for allegedly raising a false alarm on alleged Boko Haram invasion through a WhatsApp voice note. Ogundairo was accused of raising a false alarm of Boko Haram terrorists’ invasion of Imosan-Ijebu in the state. The state Police Public Relations Officer, SP, Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this on Thursday in a statement. Oyeyemi said the suspect circulated the false alarm on social media, thereby causing panic among law-abiding citizens. He said, “The  suspect was arrested when the voice note went viral and people from all walks of life started calling the command’s emergency number, expressing concern  over the safety of their loved ones in Ijebu-Ode and Ogun State as a whole. “The Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, then quickly directed the DPO Obalende Division to move into the area and find out the authenticity of the said WhatsApp voice note. “In compliance with the CP’s order, the DPO Obalende Division, SP Salami Murphy, moved into the area for a thorough investigation. “In the course of the investigation, it was discovered that the only people in that location were farm labourers from Benue State who are carrying out their legitimate business devoid of any form of violence.” Copyright PUNCH.
