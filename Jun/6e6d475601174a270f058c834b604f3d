Members of the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria have staged a protest at the National Assembly gate over the unpaid backlog of reviewed salaries and allowances. According to the organisation, the management of the National Assembly has refused to fulfil their part of the agreement signed early in the year, leading to an indefinite strike. PASAN, in a statement, said the industrial action came after three notices to the management led by the Clerk to the National Assembly, Amos Ojo. The statement read in part, “The Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria, National Assembly Service Commission and National Assembly (chapters), at its joint congress meeting of 2nd June, 2022, resolved to embark on an indefinite strike over the failure of the National Assembly management to implement the subsisting MoU jointly signed by NASC and NASS management and PASAN on the 13th of April, 2021.” See photos from protest below:  Photos:  Tope Omogbolagun Copyright PUNCH.
