Nigerian rapper, Ikechukwu Onunaku, has called for justice following the death of his wife’s cousin, Obinna Obiefuleh. According to the rapper, the deceased, a 14-year-old boy who schooled at Queen of the Holy Innocent Secondary School in Imo State, was found dead, “beaten up and bruised” in the early hours of Thursday at the school’s boarding house. Sharing a video of Obinna via his Instagram page on Thursday, Ikechukwu wrote, “This is so so sad. This is Obinna, 14 years of age, my in-law, cousin to my wife. This footage is of him at my wedding. He was found dead at 1am in the boarding house of his school. “Class – SS2, in the senior hostel, Queen of the Holy Innocent Secondary School Ogwume in Ideato LGA. Beaten up, bruised. “So many holes in this story. And frankly, I’m sick of these happenings. Now it has come to my doorstep. I urge every media portal to help bring light to the happenings surrounding this event and every other event concerning these children who we confidently give to schools to look after. “This is outrageous. No child should have to die, talk less of in this manner where they are supposed to be safe and cared for. I implore all media and bloggers to please help pursue this to the end. May his soul finally rest in peace. My deepest condolences to the entire family #JUSTICEFORPBINNAOBIEFULEH.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
