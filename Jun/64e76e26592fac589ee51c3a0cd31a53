A former presidential aspirant under the All Progressives Congress, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, has revealed that the National Chairman of the party, Abdullahi Adamu, and the party’s National Working Committee, are set to present the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for endorsement. News earlier emerged that Senator Adamu picked the Senate President as a consensus candidate of the party as its primary election holds on Tuesday. The NWC and the President had denied picking a consensus candidate, insisting that all aspirants will meet at the poll as delegates would decide who flies the flag of the party in the 2023 presidential election. However, Kalu, Chief Whip of the Senate who congratulated Lawan in a statement he personally signed on Monday, said the Senate President would be presented to Buhari for endorsement. He stated, “Sen Abdulahi Adamu has through a vigorous evaluation of all our able and qualified candidates, decided in the interest of our party and the future wellbeing of millions of Nigerians who look to our party for continuous leadership, decided that Senator Ahmed Lawan is the strongest and most suitable candidate to be the flag bearer of our party in the upcoming Presidential election. “The National Chairman and NWC of our party will present Senator Ahmed Lawan to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for his endorsement.” Copyright PUNCH.
