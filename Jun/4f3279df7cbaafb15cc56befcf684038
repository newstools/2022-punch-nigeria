No fewer than 60 Senior Advocates of Nigeria have stormed the National Industrial Court in Abuja for a legal battle against the Federal Government over the poor salaries of Nigerian judges. The PUNCH gathered that the senior lawyers were to challenge the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), the National Judicial Council, and the National Assembly, seeking an order to compel the upward review of the salaries of judicial officers. The PUNCH gathered that the SANs, who were from different parts of the country, had begun consultations on how to table their arguments and persuasions in the court. Among the SANs were Chief Adegboyega Awomolo, Kanu Agabi, Sebastine (Hon), Godwin Obla, Emeka Ngige, and Mike Ozekhome. Others included Taiwo Taiwo, Emeka Etiaba, Paul Ogbole, Henry Akunebu, Audi Anuga, John Asoluka, and Hassan Liman. It was also gathered that the suit was filed by Chief Sebastine Hon (SAN), however, going by the sitting arrangement, Chief Solomon Awomolo, SAN, alongside Kanu Agabi, SAN, would be presenting the case to the court. Justice Osatohanmwen Obasrki-Osaghae is expected to preside over the matter and was being awaited in the courtroom. The lawyers of the four defendants could not easily be identified as the mass presence of the senior lawyers for the plaintiff had overshadowed the courtroom. Chief Sebastine Hon, in the suit, marked, NIC/ABJ/CS/595/2022, is asking the court to compel the defendants to increase the salaries and allowances of judges in the country. Copyright PUNCH.
