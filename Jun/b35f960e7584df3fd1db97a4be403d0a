The leadership of the All Progressives Congress has thrown its weight behind the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), following the scathing remarks of a presidential aspirant and the National Leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. Tinubu had while speaking to the party’s delegates in Ogun State on Thursday claimed that without him, Buhari would not have become president in 2015. He also narrated the circumstances that led to the emergence of Prof. Yemi Osinbajo as the vice president, saying Buhari had offered him the running mate ticket, but some party chieftains opposed it. Reacting to Tinubu’s comments, Adamu stated that the former Lagos governor’s outburst was unbecoming of a leader of his stature, adding that the party found his latest attack on the president insulting. The APC national chairman said, “We are saddened by what we saw in the video and pray we don’t see such again. I, as Chairman of this party, have a duty to stand by Mr President. “Tinubu went as far as saying how Gen Muhammadu Buhari went to him, citing instances of even prostrating in tears begging him to endorse him and to support him for the presidency. He claimed Buhari went to him. “His utterances are very very insulting. It’s very very unbecoming for a person of that standing to do what he did to the sitting president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the President produced by the votes of the APC. Asked if the APC would punish the national leader, Adamu said a decision had not been taken. “If there is a need to punish any member of a party, not just Tinubu, we will bring it to the party’s book.
