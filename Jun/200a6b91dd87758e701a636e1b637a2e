A retired Archbishop of the Methodist Church of Nigeria, Ayo Ladigbolu, has said he is one of the contestants seeking to succeed the late Oba Lamidi Adeyemi as the Alaafin of Oyo. The stool became vacant following the death of 83-year-old Oba Adeyemi on April 22. Speaking in a telephone interview with our correspondent on Friday, Ladigbolu, who is also 83 years old, confirmed to Saturday PUNCH that he was in the race to ascend the stool of Alaafin. Ladigbolu family is a branch of the Agunloye Royal House and the kingmakers have said it is the turn of the Agunloye Ruling House to produce the next Alaafin. Asked if he is one of the contestants for the Alaafin stool, Ladigbolu said, “Yes, my name is on the list but I can’t talk about that now.” After repeated calls that spanned four hours, the octogenarian cleric said he did not want to talk about why he was jostling to succeed Oba Adeyemi because it would appear like a self-promotion. He said, “I think we should be patient and I don’t want to be seen to be promoting myself. I believe promotion comes not from the East or from the West, as the Bible says, God is the one that puts down one and lifts the other up. So, we should give some time for reflection even by all of us who have made the list. “Primarily, I have always been in the service of this community and I have also extended it beyond Oyo and to other parts of the country. I believe I have been created to serve. “My conviction has strengthened my resolve and I will continue to serve in whatever capacity. So, I believe whatever comes my way even at my age will only be a continuation of my service to God, to humanity and particularly to my beloved community.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
