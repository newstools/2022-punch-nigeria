Activities are still grounded at the National Assembly as workers resume protest against the non-payment of a backlog of salaries and allowances by the management at the complex gate on Thursday in Abuja. According to the executives of the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria, the protest which started on Monday was put on hold on Tuesday and Wednesday due to the roadblock for the All progressive Congress convention held at the Eagles Square. The protest resumed again at 6 am on Thursday and would be on till the close of the day, The PUNCH learnt. According to the protesters, they are using their working hours to demand their “rights.” Meanwhile, the association, on Thursday, brought in caterers to provide food for the protesters unlike on Monday when protesters had to fend for food. The PUNCH reports that the workers on Monday commenced an indefinite strike over the non-payment of backlog of reviewed salaries and allowances, forcing lawmakers to make a U-turn as banks, restaurants and others were forced to close. The workers had, during their protest that began in the early hours of Monday, blocked the main entrance to the premises with a bus, while they danced to music from a disc jockey stationed in the middle of the road. Power and water supplies to the buildings were cut, thereby crippling activities. On Monday, the workers besieged the second gate to the complex, blocking and occupying the road. Lawmakers, workers and journalists, among others, were prevented from driving into the premises. People were only allowed to walk into the building. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
