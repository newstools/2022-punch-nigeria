Several houses and shops were reportedly razed when a petrol-laden tanker caught fire on Sunday in Lokoja, Kogi State. Eyewitnesses told our correspondent that the tanker was about to negotiate a bend along the Ganaja-Ajaokuta Road in Lokoja when it fell on its side, leading to the spillage of its content as residents trooped to the scene to scoop fuel. PUNCH Metro gathered that a shop owner along the road lit a cigarette, which ignited the fire. However, there was no record of death as of the time of filing this report. The incident led to blockade of the road, as firefighters battled to put out the inferno. Efforts to get to the Public Relations Officer of the Kogi State Police Command, SP William Aya, proved abortive, as several calls to his mobile phone rang out. He had also yet to respond to a text message sent to him on the incident as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
