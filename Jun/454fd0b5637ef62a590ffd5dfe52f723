The Kogi State Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Suleiman Mafara, has cleared the air on the death of the late Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Ponyan Ward, Yagba East Local Government Area, Mr. Bunmi Ipinnaiye. Ipinnaiye was arrested by officials of the civil defence for attempted murder. Speaking with newsmen in his office in Lokoja, the commandant said Ipinnaiye died at ECWA Hospital, Ponyan and not at the cell of the NSCDC as claimed in some quarters. Throwing more light on the alleged suicide, the commandant said Mr. Bunmi, 42 years old, was arrested by the NSCDC following a report that he wanted to behead a young boy who was making advances toward his daughter. Following the report, the Commandant said Mr. Bunmi was arrested on June 7, 2022. The Commandant said he was arrested with the cutlass he was using to chase the 19 year-old-boy and brought to the office. While he was detained at the counter, the Commandant said they tried counselling him in a bid to calm him down when he suddenly asked for a bottle of water. The Commandant said unknown to the officer who went to get him the water that Mr. Bunmi had a negative plan, met him gasping for breath. He said upon the return of the officer, he met Mr. Bunmi, who was suspected to have tried to strangle himself, quickly rushed him to the hospital. He disclosed that after a while and efforts to stabilise him, the medical doctor confirmed Mr. Bunmi dead, adding that he didn’t die while in NSCDC custody. The Commandant said Mr. Bunmi did not commit suicide in the Civil Defence cell as claimed in the public. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
