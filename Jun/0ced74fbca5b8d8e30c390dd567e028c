The British government, through the Director of Home Office International Operations, Nick Fowler, has promised to enhance the operations of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency with the provision of strategic equipment, logistics and training as part of a £1m plan. The plan, according to a statement by the Director, Media & Advocacy, NDLEA, Femi Babafemi, on Friday, would be implemented in 2022 with additional support over the next three years. This was made known when Fowler led the Home Office International Operations’ Africa Regional Director, Julie Hartfree, and the West Africa Regional Manager, Kris Hawksfield, on a courtesy visit to the Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig.-Gen. Buba Marwa (retd.), on Thursday. Fowler commended the NDLEA, stating that it had played a significant role in intercepting loads of illicit drugs meant for the UK. He said his office was now well positioned to share intelligence with the NDLEA. In his welcome remarks, Marwa expressed appreciation to the visiting UK team and the British government for past support for the NDLEA. Marwa added that with the expansion of the operations, command structure and staff strength of the agency, he would need more support and collaboration from the UK government.  Copyright PUNCH.
