Former Deputy Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, Prof Kingsley Moghalu; and founder of Roots Television Nigeria, Dumebi Kachikwu, will on Wednesday contest for the presidential ticket of the African Democratic Congress. Speaking ahead of the event scheduled to hold in Abeokuta, Moghalu, according to a statement made available to newsmen on Sunday, promised to secure the lives and property of Nigerians if elected. He said his Presidency would have the political will to secure the country, adding that he would ensure that security is placed above ethnic or religious interests. “I will have the political will to secure our country. This means putting our security above all else: no security, no country. Political will is the willingness and ability to take tough decisions to secure Nigeria, including not succumbing to or being deceived by vested interests that might be profiting from the killing field Nigeria has become. “It also means putting Nigeria’s security above ethnic or religious interests. It means loyalty to the lives of Nigerians and the territory of Nigeria first, no matter where within our country,” he said. On his part, Kachikwu, in a post on his social media page, promised to initiate public service reforms to eradicate corruption and win the war against terrorism. The businessman assured Nigerians that if elected, he will invest in power generation, build broadband internet infrastructure and limit states and the private sector to distribution activities only.
