The Lagos State Government on Thursday commenced celebrations for this year’s World Environment Day with the planting of 10 historical breadfruit trees. The Director of Public Affairs, Ministry of Environment and Water Resources, Kunle Adeshina, disclosed this in a statement made available to The PUNCH. Other activities lined up for the celebration, according to the statement, include an Environmental Awareness Walk and submission of a petition for the support of the environment to the Lagos State House of Assembly with a climax of the 2022 celebrations on Sunday. Speaking at the ceremony which took place at the St Paul’s Anglican Primary School, Breadfruit, Lagos, the Permanent Secretary, Office of Environmental Services, Omobolaji Gaji, was quoted as saying that “the task of regenerating the environment should not be left to the government alone.” Gaji described the 2022 World Environment Day, with the theme, “Only one earth,” as a campaign to ensure that the beautiful planet remains a comfortable home for humanity. “This year’s celebration is a historic milestone for the global environmental community as it marks 50 years since the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, widely seen as the first international meeting on the environment,” he said. Gaji added that the activities of the World Environment Day as practised all over the world included planting trees, cleaning up local beaches, organising meetings and joining online protests amongst others. He described individuals and civil societies as pivotal advocates, adding that the more people raise their voices and emphasise what needs to be done, the faster change will come. Copyright PUNCH.
