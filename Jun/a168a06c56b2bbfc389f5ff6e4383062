A Federal High Court in Abuja on Thursday granted permission to the detained Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, to file more evidence against a suit by the Federal Government seeking to extradite him to the United States of America for trial. Justice Inyang Ekwo granted Kyari’s request made through his lead counsel, Nureni Jimoh (SAN), in a motion on notice. Jimoh, while arguing the motion on notice, prayed the court to allow Kyari to bring additional documentary exhibits to establish his innocence in the charges against him. Counsel for the Federal Government, Pius Akuta, however, opposed the request. Delivering a brief ruling, Justice Ekwo rejected the objection of the Federal Government and granted permission to Kyari to adduce further documentary exhibits to his own defence. The judge said the court would have ample opportunity to determine the probate value to be attached to the additional evidence. Meanwhile, Justice Ekwo has fixed June 3 for definite hearing in the extradition suit instituted by the Attorney General of the Federation, on behalf of the Federal Government, against Kyari. The suit is seeking to extradite Kyari at the request of the American Government to face trial in his indictment for an alleged internet fraud by a Nigerian, Abdulraman Abbas, also known as Hushpuppi.
