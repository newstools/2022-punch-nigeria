The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, on Monday, presented an Air Transport Licence to the interim management of Nigeria Air, the country’s proposed national carrier, led by Captain Dapo Olumide, as it raced against time to meet the new July deadline. The ATL licence was received by the interim management of Air Nigeria headed by a former Managing Director of the defunct Virgin Nigeria Airways, Captain Dapo Olumide, at the NCAA headquarters in Abuja. The ATL certification is one of the licences airlines receive before they can operate flight services. The other, Air Operator’s Certificate, which comes shortly after the ATL, is currently under processing and can be granted before the end of July. The ATL with number NCAA/ATR1/ATL214 signed by the Director General of NCAA, Captain Musa Nuhu, will run for a period of five years from June 3, 2022 to June 2, 2027. The Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, had hinted that the much-awaited national carrier would commence operation by July. The Ministry of Aviation had made this known via its official Twitter handle in a short statement which said: “The @NigerianCAA will on Monday, June 6th 2022 present the Air Transport License (ATL) to the interim management of the #NigeriaAir, Nigeria’s national carrier at the NCAA’s Corporate headquarters, Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.” Details soon… Copyright PUNCH.
