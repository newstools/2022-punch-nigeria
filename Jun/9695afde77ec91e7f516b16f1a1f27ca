Some young supporters of presidential aspirant and national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, has just stormed Eagle’s Square, the venue of the ruling party’s national convention. The supporters, all dressed in attires and caps with imprints of Tinubu’s name and logo, entered the venue in their numbers at exactly 05:00 pm, chanting, “On your mandate we shall stand”. The young supporters were welcomed by a large crowd of Pro-Tinubu delegates all sited across the Eagle Square. See photos below:   Photos: Abiodun Sanusi Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
