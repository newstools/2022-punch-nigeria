A Professor of Agricultural Economics, Simeon Bamire, was on Tuesday inaugurated as the 12th substantive Vice Chancellor of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State. Bamire took over from Prof. Eyitope Ogunbodede, who had completed his five-year tenure. In his acceptance speech, Bamire promised to build on the achievements of his predecessor. Appealing to unions in the university to cooperate with him to grow the institution, Bamire also promised to bring on board more philanthropists, private sector operators and governmental agencies to further develop the university. He said, “There are so many things my predecessor has done, but there is always a room for improvement and incidentally, the rooms are so large this time around because of the inadequacy of funds, but by God’s grace, we are going to enhance our internally generated revenue in such a way that we will support government’s funding opportunities. “We have land resources here and we will be able to make use of the land resources to enhance and promote a lot of things aside from generating income. It will be a knowledge base for our students. “I am a man of peace and I find it very difficult to move ahead if there is disunity anywhere. That is why I am appealing to our unions that are not in good shape to come together, so that we will be able to work as one because a house divided against itself cannot stand.”  Copyright PUNCH.
