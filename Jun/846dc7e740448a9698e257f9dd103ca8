The immediate past National Secretary of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, on Monday, announced his resignation from the party. In a statement issued in Abuja, on Monday, he apologised to all his supporters, reassuring them that the move is for the best. He wrote, “I write to notify you of my resignation from the All Progressives Congress, forthwith. “Henceforth, I cease to be a member of the APC in my ward (Ward 6, in Uyo LGA) or anywhere for that matter. I hereby relinquish all rights accrued to me as a member of the APC, member of the National Advisory Council and member of National Caucus of the APC. “This decision to part ways with the APC is a tough one, but leadership entails adherence to the wishes of the vast majority of associates, allies and supporters who have shown fidelity overtime and have now witnessed the obduracy of the APC in handling the candidates’ selection processes in Akwa Ibom state.” Meanwhile, Akpanudoedehe has joined the New Nigeria Peoples Party. He has also secured the governorship ticket of the party as its consensus governorship candidate for Akwa Ibom State. In his acceptance speech at the governorship primary organised by the Akwa Ibom chapter of the NNPP on Monday, Akpanudoedehe thanked the party for finding him worthy of the ticket. Copyright PUNCH.
