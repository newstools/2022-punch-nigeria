American pop icon, Britney Spears, has tied the knot with her lover, Sam Asghari, during an intimate ceremony held in Los Angeles on Thursday. Their marriage comes months after the singer was released from a 13-year conservatorship, which she claimed prevented her from getting married or having children. While her parents and two sons were absent at the event, the singer had several celebrity friends such as Paris Hilton and Drew Barrymore in attendance, E News reports. The couple’s private ceremony however took a dramatic turn as Spear’s ex-husband, Jason Alexander, tried to gate-crash the event. He went live on Instagram, filming the empty venue while telling security Britney Spears had invited him and he was there to “crash the wedding”. Alexander was later arrested by Ventura County Police on a warrant from a different county for an undisclosed offence. TMZ also reported that he has been charged with trespassing, vandalism and battery due to his physical altercations with security at the event. Britney and Jason married in Las Vegas on the spur of the moment in January 2004. They, however, called it quits barely three days later. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
