A Federal High Court sitting in Abakaliki has nullified the rescheduled primary elections of the Peoples Democratic Party in Ebonyi State. The court ruled that the primary elections that took place on June 5 and 6, 2023, which produced Senator Obinna Ogba as a governorship candidate and others were illegal, unconstitutional, null and void. The court also affirmed the primary elections conducted on May 29, 2022 that produced Dr Ifeanyi Odii as governorship candidate. The presiding Judge, Justice Fatun Riman, stated this while declaring the judgement at the Federal High Court, in Abakaliki, on Tuesday. The PUNCH reported that the PDP National Working Committee had on May 29, 2022 cancelled the primary elections of the party in the state. The party had argued that the primary elections of May 28 and 29 did not comply with the party’s guidelines, adding that the electoral panel was not properly constituted. Angered by the cancellation, Odii approached the Federal High Court Abakaliki seeking the leave of the court to declare the cancellation of the primaries as illegal, null and void.  Copyright PUNCH.
