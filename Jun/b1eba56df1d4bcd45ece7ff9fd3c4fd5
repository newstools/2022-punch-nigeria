The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Thursday, extended warm wishes and congratulations to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, on the occasion of her platinum jubilee on the throne. Buhari’s greeting was contained in a statement signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, titled ‘President Buhari salutes Queen Elizabeth II on platinum jubilee.’ It read in part, “As the Queen marks her 70th year on the throne and Head of the Commonwealth of Nations, which Nigeria is a member, the President rejoices with Her Majesty. “President Buhari notes that Queen Elizabeth II is the first British monarch to reach seven decades on the throne.” In his message to mark the special occasion, the President noted that Queen Elizabeth II had chalked a number of milestones including the fact of being the youngest ever on the throne, handling her role with confidence and grace, and now, the one who has served the longest. He expressed his admiration for the Queen as a loyal, patriotic, and compassionate leader who worked for the people, not as a ruler but as a friend and compatriot. According to Buhari, people never lose trust in Queen Elizabeth. Their firm belief is that she always has the potential to deliver, especially during troubled times. It is confirmation of the fact that Queen Elizabeth always acts and delivers according to people’s expectations. “In her lonely journey on the throne, and so recently having lost her husband and principal supporter, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, I and all our citizens wish her many more years as Queen of England and Head of the Commonwealth, in excellent condition of health.” Copyright PUNCH.
