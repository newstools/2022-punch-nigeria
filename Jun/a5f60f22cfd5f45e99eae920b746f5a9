The Resident Electoral Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission in Osun State, Prof. Abdulganiy Raji, has assured all candidates and parties, participating in the July 16 governorship poll in the state that the Commission will be fair. The REC spoke in Osogbo on Friday at the opening session of two-day capacity building for Civil Society Organisations/Non-Governmental Organisations, and People With Disabilities. Prof. Raji, who also assured that votes would count during the poll, said the Commission had engaged various stakeholders, including royal fathers as part of measures to ensure a free and fair poll. He said, “I want to reassure you that INEC will ensure that votes count during the forthcoming governorship election as a level-playing ground would be provided for all candidates and political parties contesting this election.” Speaking further, Raji also acknowledged maximum cooperation the Commission had received from the security agencies in the state under the umbrella of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security. He added that the Commission had also formed a strategic alliance and partnership with CSOs found credible to interface and engage with, with a view to generating new ideas and ideal ways to carry out her activities. He further explained that the workshop was put together by the Commission to acquaint the CSOs, NGOs, and PWDs with the best ways of conducting effective voters’ education and public mobilisation, especially at the grassroots. He, however, charged the participants to assist the Commission to conduct voter education in every part of the state for the peaceful conduct of the governorship poll. Copyright PUNCH.
