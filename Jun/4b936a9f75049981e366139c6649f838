Super Eagles defender William Troost-Ekong and midfielder Innocent Bonke have been excused from Monday’s (today) 2023 AFCON qualifier between Nigeria and Sao Tome and Principe following injuries. The duo returned to their respective bases in England and France to attend to the injuries they sustained during the international break. Stand-in Super Eagles captain Troost-Ekong suffered a muscle injury against Sierra Leone last Thursday and couldn’t recover in time for the trip to Morocco. The Watford player could only feature for 82 minutes before making way for Spain-based Kenneth Omeruo in the 2-1 comeback victory over the Leone Stars in Abuja. Bonke was injured in the friendly game against Mexico in Dallas on May 28 and was replaced at the break by Katsina United defender Sani Faisal. The Lorient star jetted out to France on Saturday for further treatment on the injury.
