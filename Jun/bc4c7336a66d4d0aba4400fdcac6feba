Super Eagles coach Jose Peseiro has appealed for more time to build a formidable team despite Nigeria’s 2-1 victory against Sierra Leone in their opening fixture of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. The three-time African champions had to stage a first-half comeback to kick start their campaign on a winning note. Peseiro’s side trailed by a goal after 11 minutes of play after a diving header from Jonathan Morshay in the 11th minute gave the Leone Stars the lead but the Eagles stormed back and were level within four minutes after Alex Iwobi cured in a low drive from the edge of the Leone Stars penalty area. Victor Osimhen secured the win for the Eagles four minutes before half time. Speaking after the game, Peseiro shared his elation with the victory, but he agreed that the West-African giants were not at their best. “We are better than Sierra Leone in this game”, Peseiro said after the game. “We deserve the win. We changed the setup in the second half, I think it was only in the last ten minutes that our opponents had some good spaces. “We created a lot of scoring chances, we could have won with a bigger margin, but the team needs more time and we must work. The Super Eagles would look to be at their best when they lock horns with Sao Tome and Principe in the second round of games.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
