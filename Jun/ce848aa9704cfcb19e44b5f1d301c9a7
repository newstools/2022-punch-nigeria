The Minister of State for Health, Senator Adeleke Mamora, on Thursday, congratulated the National Leader of All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, over his emergence as the presidential flag bearer of the party. Mamora’s congratulatory message was contained in a letter personally addressed to the former governor of Lagos State. Tinubu defeated Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi and 12 other presidential aspirants to clinch the APC ticket. While describing him as standing tall among his peers, Mamora disclosed that his victory at the convention was well deserved. The letter read, “You have come a long way in your political career, demonstrating courage, vision and strategy, the three attributes that I have always believed stand you out among your peers. Your resilience even in the face of seemingly daunting odds is legendary. “You have led from the front as a leader and have come thus far to the glory of God. The real battle still lies ahead in 2023. “As you march on with confidence, may your troops be willing in your day of battle and may God’s purpose for your life be fulfilled. Congratulations, my leader.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
