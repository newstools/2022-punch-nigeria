The Osun State Government, on Sunday, commiserated with the family of Mr. Israel Ajao, and the Nigerian Police Force, over the passage of the retired Deputy Inspector-General of Police. Ajao, whose death occurred on Friday at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, was described in a statement by the state Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Funke Egbemode, as a fine officer. While in the service, Ajao was the pioneer Assistant Inspector-General in charge of the Force Intelligence Unit and also served as the Deputy Inspector-General in charge of Force Criminal Investigations, and later, Operations, before retiring in 2010. The statement read in parts, “We are also extending our sympathies to the good people of Oluponna in particular and Osun State in general over the demise of one of the state’s finest national icon. The death of DIG Israel Ajao (retd.) is painful and a huge loss not only to his family but to the nation. He was a committed and experienced Police Officer who served the nation diligently and passionately. “His heroics were also notable in his advancement of the community policing agenda and his strategic contributions in the Force saw him hold think-tank positions including serving as Board Chairman, Lagos Neighborhood Safety Corps. On behalf of the governor, government, and the people of Osun, we extend our deepest condolences to the family of DIG Israel Ajao (retd). His legacies of professionalism and service to humanity are a pride to us as a state and a valuable lesson for the younger generation. “We pray God grants the soul of the deceased eternal rest and give his bereaved family, friends, and associates the fortitude to bear the huge loss.” Copyright PUNCH.
