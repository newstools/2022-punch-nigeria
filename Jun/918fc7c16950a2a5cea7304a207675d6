A  budding singer and disc jockey, Mimi Yorzua, aka KillarVibez117, has said that though the entertainment industry is brimming with talented acts, he stands out because he is both a singer and DJ. In an interview with Saturday Beats, he said, “I am a dream chaser. That is why I decided to be a professional DJ in addition to pursuing a career in music. I am here for the long haul, and I won’t stop until I accomplish my heart desire, which is to be a household name in the global entertainment industry. “I am a very humble young man who loves his family and career passionately. “My style of music can be described as a blend of afrobeat and afropop, but it is laden with several messages that would have a positive impact on the lives of listeners. My childhood in both the northern and southern parts of Nigeria also give me a very solid foundation to understand different cultures and project them in my music.” Copyright PUNCH.
