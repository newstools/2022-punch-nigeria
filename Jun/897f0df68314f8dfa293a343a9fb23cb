The Nigeria-British Chamber of Commerce has called for concerted efforts toward addressing fundamental problems faced by exporters in the country. The chamber stated this during an advocacy roundtable held to discuss the challenges associated with exportation in Lagos recently. Speaking at the roundtable discussion, Chairman, NBCC Advocacy Committee, Anne Rinu, said the discussion was borne out of challenges expressed by exporters involved in the business of non-oil exports. According to her, the challenges in exportation ranged from multiple bureaucratic government regulatory agencies and foreign exchange restrictions to lack of funding/financial access and port infrastructural irregularities. She said, “We want to use this medium to announce that we intend to further engage with the Nigerian Ports Authority, Shippers Council, and other relevant authorities at the 2nd phase of the NBCC Advocacy Roundtable which will be coming up on the 10th of August 2022. This event will address the issues of over-crowding, frequent delays, and loss of cargo at the Port amongst others.” Highlights of the discussion included: enhancing efficiency in implementing export incentives, processes and requirements of entering UK markets as well as bringing all the government economic agencies (NPA, NCS, NDA, others) and the business community together on a regular basis to discuss and resolve the issues raised at ports.
