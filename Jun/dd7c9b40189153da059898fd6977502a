Paolo Zanetti has taken over as Empoli manager, the Serie A club announced on Monday after former coach Aurelio Andreazzoli left last week. In a statement, Empoli said that former Venezia coach Zanetti had signed a two-year deal with an option for a third season. Zanetti, 39, was sacked by Venezia in April as part of a failed bid for Serie A safety. He was replaced by youth team coach Andrea Soncin, who failed to keep the Lagoon side up at the end of their first top-flight season in two decades. Andreazzoli left Empoli at the beginning of the month after the Tuscan outfit was promoted from Serie B. AFP
