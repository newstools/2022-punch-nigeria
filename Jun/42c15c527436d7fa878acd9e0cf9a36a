There was nearly a stampede at the venue of the All Progressive Congress primary when the crowd overpowered the security officials on duty and gained access to Eagle Square, the venue of the convention. The issue was quickly brought under control as another set of security officials went in to block the last gate to the venue of the national convention. The PUNCH reports that the main entrance has become full of people, making it difficult for delegates to gain access to the venue. After the main gate, are four other gates before final access to the last gate. The mob broke the third gate before security men quickly went to block the last gate. As of 7 pm, many delegates are still locked outside the gate trying to find access to the convention ground. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
