The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and All Progressives Congress presidential candidate for 2023, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, are expected in Ekiti State on Tuesday to rally support for the party’s candidate in Saturday’s governorship election, Mr Biodun Oyebanji. Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, said the APC mega rally meant to boost Oyebanji’s chances in the election, would also have in attendance the party’s National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, APC governors and other critical stakeholders in the party. Oyebanji is contesting against candidates of 15 other political parties, including the Peoples Democratic Party, Social Democratic Party and African Democratic Congress to fill the governorship seat, which will be vacated by Fayemi on October 15 on the completion of two terms in office. A total 988,923 registered voters are eligible to vote in the election out of which no fewer than 75 per cent have collected their permanent voter cards according to the Independent National Electoral Commission.
