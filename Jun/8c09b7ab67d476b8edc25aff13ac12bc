Luka Modric has agreed to extend his trophy-laden Real Madrid stay to over a decade by signing a one-year contract extension. The European and La Liga champions on Wednesday confirmed that Modric will remain at the Santiago Bernabeu for another season. Modric joined Los Blancos from Tottenham in August 2012 and has made over 400 appearances for the club and was adjudged to have been one of the worst signings of the season. The 36-year-old midfielder pulled the strings as Carlo Ancelotti’s side completed a UEFA Champions League and Spanish LaLiga double in a glorious 2021/2022 season. Modric has won the Champions League five times, the La Liga titles three times, and lifted the FIFA Club World Cup on four occasions. The Croatia captain also won the Copa del Rey once during his long spell in the Spanish capital. He also has three European Super Cup winners’ medals and has celebrated Supercopa de Espana success four times. Modric won his 150th cap for his country in a 1-1 UEFA Nations League draw with France on Monday. (dpa/NAN)
