Some bandits in the early hours of Saturday invaded Iri Station, Idon Ward of Kajuru Local Government Area of Kaduna State and abducted no fewer than 14 people. A Supervisory Councillor of Admin, Finance and Health of the Council, Bala Jonathan, who confirmed the incident, said the bandits struck in the wee hours on Saturday. Jonathan gave the identity of those abducted by the hoodlums to include Abdullahi, Yakubu Isah, Samson Julius, Angelina Julius, Pasema Daniel, Junior,  Bobo Julius, Saratu Mohammed, Asenath Sunday, Confidence Jerry, Barnaki Sunday, Moses Kenneth, Danladi Goma and Ummi Jibrin. “These are the names of abducted persons in Iri Station which we have discovered for now. The sad event happened in the early hours of today, June 4, 2022,” he said. He added that some of the natives who were kidnapped earlier “are still being held by the criminal gangs because their loved ones and communities have not been able to raise the ransom demanded by their abductors.” It was gathered that the community (Idon) is fast becoming haven for the hoodlums who at will abduct natives with reckless abandon, leaving the members of the communities with no option but to part with ransoms in order to save their beloved ones. The Kaduna State Police Command had yet to confirm the incident as of the time of filing this report. When contacted on the telephone, the state Command’s Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, promised to get in touch with the officer in charge of the area and get back to our correspondent but he hadn’t at press time. “Let me call the Sector Commander there and get back to you,” Jalige told our correspondent.
