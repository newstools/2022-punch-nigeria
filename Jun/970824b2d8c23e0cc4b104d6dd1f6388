The number of players in the Super Eagles camp ahead of the friendly game against Ecuador has increased to 21 with the arrival of another striker in the squad. According to the updates from the Super Eagles camp in the United States, Watford striker Emmanuel Dennis is the latest arrival for the friendly match. Dennis missed the 2-1 loss against Mexico on Saturday as Nigerians witnessed Peseiro’s first game in charge of the Eagles. Dessers who scored his first Eagles’ career goal led the frontline alongside Terem Moffi in the loss to El Tri and Peseiro will be hoping Dennis can bring more spark to the team’s attack. Three-time African champions, Nigeria are participating in these friendlies as part of their final preparation for the opening game in the qualifiers for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations. As specified in the official press statement issued by the NFF, only 25 players will make the final list for the tour, which is preparatory to next month’s 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying matches. The Super Eagles are up against Sierra Leone in Abuja on June 9 and São Tomé & Príncipe in Marrakech, Morocco on June 13. The Eagles are currently at New Jersey in readiness to confront Ecuador at the Red Bull Arena in Harrison on Thursday (tomorrow).  All rights reserved.
