The leadership of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Shekinah Glory Zonal Parish, headed by Pastor Segun Adeoye and wife, Pastor Keji Tina, shared gifts to women and children of the church as they celebrated their movement to their new site. The three-day programme reached its climax on Sunday, May 29. The event, which was tagged ‘Celebration of God’s faithfulness’, saw children in their numbers from the zone have fun on Friday, May 27, with bouncing castles, clowns, popcorns, ballet dance and choreography. Some women, who also received gifts, were treated to musical performances by different groups and got exposed to teachings on how to be a model woman who successfully builds her home and ministry.
