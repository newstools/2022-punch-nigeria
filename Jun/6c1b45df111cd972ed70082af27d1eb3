An international election monitor and the Chief Executive Connect Development, Ambassador Hamzat Lawal, has called for the resignation or sacking of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele for allegedly mixing politics with his job. Lawal, who is an anti-corruption activist, was speaking on Saturday on the sideline of the 25th coronation anniversary of the Ohinoyi of Egbiraland, Dr Ado Ibrahim, held at his palace in Okene. “The job of the Central Bank as the custodian of the economy is too sensitive to be left in the hands of a politician as his decision would be coloured by political considerations. According to him, Emefiele’s recent attempt to have a shot at the presidency has shown him to be a politician and should be allowed to go so that he can focus on his political career. He said the President, Maj. Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) should do the needful by either asking him to resign or sack him. Lawal also asked the National Assembly to pass a vote of no confidence in Emefiele for allegedly engaging in politics alongside his job as the governor of the Apex bank. “As for me I have already passed a vote of no confidence in him as the economy has witnessed a downward trend since he took over the CBN over seven years ago,” he added.
