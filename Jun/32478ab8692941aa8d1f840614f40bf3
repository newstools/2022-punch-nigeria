Oyo State Deputy Governor, Rauf Olaniyan, on Sunday, announced that he had defected to the All Progressives Congress. The announcement of his defection from the Peoples Democratic Party was made in his private office, Ojoo, Ibadan, while addressing journalists. His announcement came after weeks of speculations that he was going to leave the party because of the frosty relationship between him and his boss, Governor Seyi Makinde. There were reports on Thursday that Makinde had dropped Olaniyan as his running mate for the 2023 governorship poll but no official statement had been issued to that effect. The deputy governor had in 2020 complained to the Dr. Saka Balogun-led committee to reconcile aggrieved PDP members, that Makinde had sidelined him for a long time. Copyright PUNCH.
