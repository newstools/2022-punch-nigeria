New Super Eagles Head Coach, José Peseiro, has met with the Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare, for the first time since his appointment. Dare met with the Portuguese at a reception in a conference hall at the sports ministry on Wednesday. At the reception, Dare charged the former Venezuela and Sporting Lisbon manager to be consistent in delivering excellent results for the Super Eagles as Nigeria is a football-loving country. Peseiro, on the other hand, expressed his belief in the team and his readiness to win the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations in Côte d’Ivoire. “I want to win the next AFCON for my fantastic players and for Nigerians. I’m confident because I believe in this team, I believe in the quality and the number of good players,” Peseiro stated. See photos:    Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
