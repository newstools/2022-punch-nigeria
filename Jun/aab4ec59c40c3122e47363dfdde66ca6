The Federal Government, on Wednesday, said it has begun consultations with the Economic Community of West African States for the commencement of works on the Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline. The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources and former presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress, Timipre Sylva, disclosed this to State House Correspondents shortly after the over three-hour FEC meeting presided over by the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, at the Council Chambers of the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The Pipeline, he said, would be the world’s longest offshore pipeline and second-largest pipeline globally carrying gas from Nigeria to Morocco and running through at least 11 West African countries, to Spain in Europe. “Today, the Ministry of petroleum resources presented three memos to Council. The first memo, the Council approved for the NNPC Limited to execute a memorandum of understanding with ECOWAS for the construction of the Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline. “This pipeline is to take gas to 15 West African countries and to Morocco and through Morocco to Spain and Europe. “At this moment, we are still at the Front-End Engineering design. It is only after the engineering design of the pipeline that we will know exactly what the cost of the pipeline will be. When that time comes, we will be talking about funding.” Copyright PUNCH.
