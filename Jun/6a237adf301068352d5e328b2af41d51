There was panic on Saturday morning at the New Benin Market area of Benin City, Edo State capital, as angry youths, mainly traders, went on a rampage after an Igbo trader was allegedly attacked with a machete by another trader of northern extraction during a fracas. The trouble was said to have started after a brief argument between the two traders. The Igbo trader was said to have ordered the Hausa trader to leave the front of his stall. The Hausa trader, who felt slighted, allegedly drew his machete and inflicted several cuts on the Igbo trader. A viral video making the rounds on social media shows angry youths in a wild protest as they pounced on the suspected assailant. As of the time of filing in this report, a combined team of armed security personnel made up of military and police had taken over the troubled commercial area. Details later… Copyright PUNCH.
