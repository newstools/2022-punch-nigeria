The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari(retd), has arrived at the scene of the convention of the All Progressives Congress, The PUNCH reports. Buhari, who arrived around 7:40 pm, came in the company of security operatives. The PUNCH reports that Buhari had been under pressure as regards the choice of his successor. Buhari, in a meeting with governors under the ruling APC, had noted that he would appreciate their support in choosing his successor. In another meeting with aspirants, the president noted the need to reduce the number of aspirants. Though the president in a statement released by his special assistant, Garba Shehu insisted that he would not impose any candidate. The Governor of Plateau state, Simon Lalong, in an interview with Channels Television on Tuesday, noted that Buhari had okayed a list of five aspirants. Lalong said, “The President told us any of these five (aspirants) is qualified to be president and have contributed to the party (APC). He said he is comfortable with any of them. “Our recommendation is to enable us to give direction for the party as we go into the primary. We cannot go with everybody, but in our view, these are the people we think should remain.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
