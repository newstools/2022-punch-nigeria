A national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on Monday, visited Owo town in Ondo State, where some terrorists attacked a Catholic Church on Sunday. He condemned the attack and urged the security agencies in the state to fish out the perpetrators of the dastardly act, which occurred at the St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo. Speaking at the palace of the Olowo of Owo, Oba Ajibade Ogunoye, the presidential aspirant on the platform of the APC commiserated with the monarch and the people of the town. Tinubu was accompanied by the state governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu; a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Yakubu Dogara, and other chieftains of the party. Tinubu said, “I want to call on the security agencies to fish out the perpetrators of the attack.” Tinubu also prayed that such terrible incident would not occur again in the state. Earlier, Governor Akeredolu had expressed gratitude to Tinubu for the visit, saying he (Tinubu) had proved that “he is a worthy leader by leaving his political campaign to visit Owo.” Copyright PUNCH.
