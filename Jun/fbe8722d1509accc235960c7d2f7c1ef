Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu, has said that he is not the Director General of Lawan Campaign Organisation, the team in charge of the presidential aspiration of Senate President, Ahmad Lawan. The senator representing Abia North was reacting to media reports which listed him as the Director General of the organisation. In a release sent to newsmen, Kalu said, “The list should be disregarded, as no authorisation was given to the effect of its publication.” He said, “It is important to notify the general public that we are not yet in the campaign proper. A committee will be inaugurated to that effect once our most preferred candidate, Senator Ahmad Lawan, emerges as the presidential candidate of All Progressives Congress.” Kalu added, “I am also running for election in my senatorial district and would rather recommend a sitting governor who is not running for an election to chair the campaign team at the right time”. According to him, several private visitors who were not even part of the meeting were also reported to have been in attendance, including Sen. Betty Apiafi and Sen. Uche Ekwunife who visited on a different bipartisan matter concerning the senate. He warned, “It is mischief to have included these names as part of Ahmad Lawan Campaign Organisation”.
