The All Progressives Congress in Ebonyi has described Gov. David Umahi’s performance at the party’s recent presidential primary in Abuja as “gallantry”. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Umahi placed sixth with 38 votes at the primary which was won by former Lagos Governor, Bola Tinubu. While the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, scored 47 voted, Ogbonnaya Onu, who is a former Minister of Science and Technology got one vote. Former Imo State Governor of Imo State, Owelle Rochas Okorocha, scored zero vote. The state Chiarman of the party, Chief Stanley Okoro-Emegha, in a statement made available to newsmen on Friday, congratulated Umahi on his “courageous and resilient disposition” during the primary. He said the governor made the state and entire Igbo race proud, having garnered the highest votes among the Igbo contestants at the primary. “You can never know the quantum of joy and prestige you gave not only to Ebonyi but the entire Igbo nation by your firm disposition during the primary. “You won the hearts and admirations of many as multitudes across the country have commended and eulogised you,” the statement said. The chairman said that Umahi’s performance took Ebonyi out of relegation corridors as his first shot at the presidential seat had a heavy impact. He said, “We appreciate the delegates and other party faithful for their unprecedented support to the governor. Ebonyi people are trustworthy and cannot be influenced by materialistic tendencies. “The 39 votes from the state were judiciously utilised towards the two presidential aspirants from the state. Our hearts, however, bleed by the betrayal from our sister states. We consulted vigorously among them but their delegates could not even offer a vote in our favour.”
