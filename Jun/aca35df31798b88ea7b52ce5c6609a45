A professor in the Department of History and International Studies, Osun State University, Osogbo, ‘Siyan Oyeweso, has called on stakeholders to ensure proper documentation of history of their various towns. This, according to him, will enable interested scholars undertake research work  and also assist in the preservation of culture. Oyeweso, who is immediate past Director, Centre for Black Culture and International Understanding, Osogbo, disclosed this in Oke-Ila Orangun, during a programme tagged, ‘National conference on the history and culture of Oke-Ila Orangun,’ organised by the town. Describing Oke-Ila Orangun as a community with interesting history, Oyeweso specifically charged Orangun of Oke-Ila, Oba Adedokun Abolarin, to work on the authorised version of the town’s history and produce it in digital form for people across the globe to access it. He said, “Let us not forget our history, customs and traditions. Do you have any place reserved purposely for burying of dead kings called Baara in Oke-Ila? I know you don’t have. “All kings that have passed away in Oyo empire are buried at Baara. Also let us learn something for Ooni of Ife (Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi). Within his palace, he created what is called royal museum in which you will see pictorial images of the all past Ooni of Ife.” In his remarks, Oba Abolarin, who went over the history of the town, commended Osun government officials and traditional rulers that were in attendance. He lauded his subjects for coming up with such an initiative. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
