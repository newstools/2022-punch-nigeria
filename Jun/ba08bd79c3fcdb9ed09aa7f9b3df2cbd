A former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Chief Adebayo Adelabu, said on Thursday, that he had joined the Accord Party. He said he intended to contest the 2023 governorship election on the platform of his new party after he lost the All Progressives Congress ticket to Senator Teslim Folarin. Adelabu said this in a statement on the same day Asiwaju Bola Tinubu visited Ibadan and advised Folarin to begin to beg aggrieved APC leaders to support him in order to win the election. Adelabu, who contested and lost the 2019 governorship election to Governor Seyi Makinde of Peoples Democratic Party, explained that he left the APC because of injustice, lies, conspiracy and malice. He said, “It is needless to restate in detail, reason for relinquishing my APC membership on the point that such reason is public knowledge. “The man dies in him who keeps silent in the face of blatant injustice and the life of a lie is a matter of little time. Evil people struggle in vain in their conspiracy against their innocent fellowman because malice is a poor match for destiny.”
