The hard-hitter, who displayed great technique and footwork to overcome his opponent, claimed the Mojisola Ogunsanya Memorial Trophy for the best boxer of the night and the cash prize of N1m. “I’m delighted to have won this trophy and N1m after just four months I turned pro and I believe this is just the beginning of good things to come in my career,” Kadima said. The seven-bout event also saw Ibadan-based lightweight boxer Samuel Moses defeat Wale Anifowose, thereby ending a streak of victories for Lagos-based boxers.

Super welterweight star, Jafar “Armor Tank” Suleiman, also knocked out Basiru Kabiru in their super welterweight duel. The light heavyweight tie was decided by a unanimous decision in favour of Segun “Success” Olanrewaju, who faced a spirited challenge from Victor Bennet, all through the eight-round duel.
