State governors in the South West region of the country, under the auspices of South-West Governors Forum, have expressed worry over the influx of large number of commercial motorcyclists also known as okada riders, to the region. To this end, the forum said it would set up a security committee tagged ,’South West Security Committee’ that would look into the operations of the okada riders across the six states in the region. This was part of the resolutions reached at a virtual meeting of the six governors held on Friday. The meeting’s communiqué was made available by the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, Mr Richard Olatunde, on Sunday. The communiqué read in part, “The governors, as Chief Security Officers, resolved to continue to assist security agencies in the areas of crisis management and intelligence gathering at all times. “The governors reviewed reports from various states on the factors militating against peace and security in the region.  They expressed grave concern on the influx of Okada riders into all parts of the South West, especially the state capitals. The meeting further resolved that efforts be geared toward identity management of Okada riders and stringent regulation put in place for their operation. “Consequently, the forum decided it was time to reconvene the South West Security Committee to look critically into this creeping menace before it blossoms into another intractable social problem. “The committee will be expected to submit its findings on the desirability of Okada operations in the region. It is also expected to submit a multi-level template to combat the threat of insurgency and terrorism in the region.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
