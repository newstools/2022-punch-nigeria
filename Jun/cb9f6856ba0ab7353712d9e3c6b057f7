The Lagos State Government has said it will partner with non-governmental organisations as part of measures to attain sustainable development in the state. The Commissioner for Economic Budget and Planning, Mr Samuel Egube, stated this on Friday during a NGO summit organised by the Lagos State Development Partners Initiatives, in Alausa, Ikeja. He said, “We are committed to collaborative and consultative governance and therefore, this is one of such moves by Mr Governor through the Ministry of Economic Planning and Budget to interact with the civil society and see what they have been doing in their respective NGOs. “They have been partners with the government in developing and supporting citizens in the society in different ways but we plan to expand this cooperation to promote national development through citizen participation, attracting and retaining top talents and working with the private sector to deliver landmark development projects.” The Commissioner for Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Mrs Bolaji Dada, who was represented by Mrs Babarinde Itunu, listed the achievements of the ministry in training women in various skills. “I want to particularly applaud the organisers of this summit, which is the first of its kind, for enhancing women’s proficiency across all strata such that a huge percentage of our women will become financial contributors to economic growth,” she stated. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Sustainable Development Goals, Mrs Solape Hammond, urged NGOs to familiarise themselves with the government’s agenda and identify how and where to come in to collaborate.
