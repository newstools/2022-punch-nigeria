Five senatorial aspirants on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, who boycotted the primary election for Adamawa Southern Senatorial District, have expressed surprised at the declaration of Adamu Ismail as winner of the election. The PUNCH reported that Grace Bent, Ahmed Abubakar, Bala Sanga, Sani Jada and Bridget Zidon, in their petition to the Senate Appeal Committee for Adamawa, condemned the emergence of Ismail through a purported primary which neither they nor their agents attended. They want the nomination rescinded for vote buying, contrary to clauses 8(ii),8 (iv) and 8(vi) of the guidelines for the nomination of candidates for the 2023 general elections. Their petition was titled Petition against Adamu Ismaila Numan for vote buying and bringing disrepute to the party contrary to the law, and clauses 8(ii), 8(iv) and 8(vi) of the guidelines for the nomination of candidates for the 2023 general elections. They urged the appeal panel not to allow the outcome of the primary to stand. A former Attorney General and Commissioner of Justice in the state, Bala Sanga who read the petition, said Adamu engaged in vote buying, and the lawful thing was to disqualify him. Copyright PUNCH.
