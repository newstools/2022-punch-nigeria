The police on Friday disrupted a protest by families of the kidnapped Abuja-kaduna train passengers on Friday. Terrorists on March 28 attacked the Abuja -Kaduna train, leading to the death of eight passengers while others were kidnapped. The families had since the incident been pleading with the Federal Government to rescue their loved ones held captive by the terrorists. The families  gathered at the Unity Fountain carrying placards with inscriptions such as “The victims are dying in captivity,” “Mr President, please help us,’’ “Our blood pressure keeps rising every day,” “We hardly sleep with our two eyes closed” among others. They planned to march to the National Assembly but were intercepted by policemen on their way and sent away by the policemen. The policemen claimed that the families didn’t inform them of the protest. Speaking to City Round, one of the family members, Abdulmumin Mohammed, bemoaned the actions of the policemen, adding that they were supposed to show empathy. He expressed dissatisfaction at the efforts of the government in rescuing the victims, urging the government to accelerate action to ensure their freedom. Mohammed said, “The policemen are supposed to show empathy. They are supposed to join us in this struggle but out of their insensitivity they decided to do otherwise. It is a pity. Our loved ones had been in captivity for over 60 days. Most of them are not in healthy conditions. We need the government to expedite action on whatever they are doing. The victims are dying and we are also not enjoying ourselves back home.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
