A former President of the Senate, Ken Nnamani, on Monday, has pulled out of the race to secure the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress. The former lawmaker announced his withdrawal during a meeting with journalists in Abuja on Monday. He said, “In the present circumstances, it does not make any sense for me to continue in the race as I have not had the opportunity to market my profile and ideas to the delegates of our party in a manner that allows for deliberation and introspection. “Therefore, I discontinue my aspiration and wish the party a successful primary and unity of purpose so that we can win the 2023 general elections. “I will continue to engage with the party and its leadership to make sure that the ideas and values that I cherish and propagate find a strong footing in the party administration and in public leadership after the election.” Copyright PUNCH.
