Security operatives on Tuesday threw tear gas canisters to disperse some supporters of the All Progressives Congress and journalists from the venue of the special convention at Eagle Square, Abuja. The incident occurred when the victims were being asked for means of identification and their mission at the venue. However, as the turnout of party supporters and media men grew larger, an overzealous policeman shot tear gas canisters into the crowd. His action evoked an immediate response from other operatives, who also embarked on a show of force by flogging the fleeing parties. The PUNCH, on Monday, reported the brutality and intolerance of policemen, operatives of the Department of State Security, and men from the NSCDC mounted at different roadblocks leading to the venue and within its precinct. Their frequent harassment made many civil servants working at the Federal Secretariat and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stay off work. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
