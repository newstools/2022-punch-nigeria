Four persons have been confirmed dead in a clash between the Lunguda community and some settlers in Adamawa State. The incident, which happened at Lafiya in Lamurde Local Government Area of the state, was confirmed by the Lamurde Council Chairman, Bulus Daniel. Daniel informed The PUNCH on Tuesday about the death of four persons in the violent confrontation which started on Monday morning. “I can confirm to you that about four people have been killed, but we do not have the full statistics of the casualties as of now,” Daniel said. A resident of the area, who did not want his name in print, said, “The violence on Monday emanated from pent-up anger following ceaseless attacks on innocent residents. “Sometimes ago, our people came under heavy attack when they visited their farms as some of them sustained injuries from machete cuts. We told the authorities but nothing was done. “The same thing happened today while our people were on the farm. Some people attacked them and killed one man called Sani, while two others were killed on the outskirts of the town leading to the escalation of the conflict.” “The people have been coming to Dan Isa to threaten us to vacate the land, claiming that it’s their ancestral land and we have paid dues on the same piece of land. All our complaints for redress fell on deaf ears.” The Adamawa State Police Command confirmed the incident, saying calm had been restored. The command’s spokesman, Sulaiman Nguroje, said policemen have been deployed in the troubled area. “The Divisional Police Officer of the area has sent a report to the effect that there was a communal conflict.”  Copyright PUNCH.
