Bendel Insurance continued their impressive run of form as they defeated visiting Osun United 2-0 in their matchday 16 game of the Nigeria National League at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, Benin City at the weekend. The Benin Arsenal started the game strongly and their efforts paid off as early as the ninth minute, when Meyiwa Oritseweyinmi capitalised on a loose ball to grab the opening goal. The visitors battled back but were kept at bay as the first half ended 1-0. Insurance then had to wait till the 85th minute to increase the tally, with Zaidu Ayuba calmly controlling a through pass before hitting the target. Insurance, who still maintain top of Group B1 with 34 points, will next face Ekiti United in an away week 17 encounter. Coaches of both teams were not available for the post-match conference, but Permanent Secretary, Edo State Sports Commission, Mrs Sabina Chikere, noted, “We are impressed with what Insurance has done so far in the league. We are back on top and our target is to finish top and gain promotion to NPFL. “The Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration has made it clear that Edo should be number one in all sporting activities and Insurance cannot be in the lower division.” Copyright PUNCH.
