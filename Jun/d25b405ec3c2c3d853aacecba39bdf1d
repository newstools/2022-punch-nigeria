A middle-aged man, identified simply as Mustapha, has been killed by hoodlums in Plateau State. The victim was said to be going home after closing from work on Monday when he ran into the group, who were engaged in a free-for-all in Anguwa Rogo community, in the Jos North Local Government Area of the state. Mustapha was stabbed by the men and rushed to a hospital, where he died on Tuesday. A resident, Ibrahim Tasiu, said the victim lost a lot of blood before he died. Tasiu said, “Yesterday night (Monday) at Anguwan Rogo community, a man named Mustapha was coming back home from his working place around 7.50pm. A group of Sara Suka boys were fighting each other when Mustapha was passing by. “He wanted to enter his house when one of the hoodlums followed him and stabbed him with a sharp knife in the chest. Mustapha shouted and fell with blood all over his body. Some people came and took him to the nearest hospital, but he passed away this morning (Tuesday). There was tension, but we called security operatives from the Anguwan Rogo Police Station and also personnel of the military special taskforce. “Both of them came and this morning (Tuesday) Mustapha was buried around 9am after he died from the injuries he sustained in the attack. The person who stabbed Mustapha was later identified, but he ran away. Security agents have arrested all his family members. Till now, security personnel are still in the community, monitoring the situation.” A spokesman for the Plateau State Police Command, Ubah Ogaba, did not take his calls when contacted on the incident.
