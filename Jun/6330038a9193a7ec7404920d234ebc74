The Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, on Thursday, reiterated his support for financial autonomy for the judiciary. Ortom stated this during the inauguration of three high court judges in Makurdi. He said, “I wish to use this occasion to again stress my total support, not only for financial autonomy, but complete autonomy for the judiciary. “To this end, I wish to recommend that all entitlements due to the judiciary should be deducted at source from the Federation Account and remitted directly to the heads of courts for onward payment to judicial staff. “Specifically, all matters of welfare of judicial staff – salary, pension and gratuity should henceforth be handled by the National Judicial Council.” “This, I believe, has become necessary for the smooth and effective operations of the judiciary in a democratic setting.”
