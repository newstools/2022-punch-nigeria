The Environmental Officer of the General Hospital, Ijede, Mrs Rita Ehinmetan, has urged members of the public not to relent in cultivating the habit of cleaning the environment to make it habitable for everyone and future generations. According to the statement made available to The PUNCH on Tuesday, Ehinmetan made the call while speaking at a sensitisation programme organised by the hospital to commemorate the 2022 World Environmental Day. She also noted the essence of this year’s celebration is to advocate a cleaner environment. She emphasised the need to guard and protect the environment jealously for the health and wellbeing of all human beings, plants, and animals. Ehinmetan implored all participants to always patronise the Private Sector Participation operators in their respective areas. She emphasised the need to dispose off refuse appropriately to prevent the spread of germs and diseases in the environment. The statement quoted her as calling on “Lagosians to shun every act of illegal disposal of refuse in drainages and canals, cultivate the habit of recycling, dispose of sewage properly to prevent outbreaks of infectious diseases, reduce carbon emissions and encourage tree planting among others.” She added that cultivating these habits will go a long way in preventing pollution, depletion of the ozone layer, degradation, and the protection of water bodies and water sources among others.
