Sterling Bank Plc says it has partnered with Community Pot, a social impact project, to launch a pilot project in Lagos to feed 500 malnourished children across Nigeria. The bank said this while speaking at the launch of the project with the theme ‘Adopt a child to recovery.’ The Chief Executive Officer, Sterling One Foundation, Mrs Olapeju Ibekwe, was quoted in a statement as saying that Sterling Bank was passionate about children and their health. She said the bank was excited to be a part of the project and would support the Community Pot project to feed 200 children for about three months by providing them with a baby feed known as Toddler Protein. The feed is manufactured by Whole Eats Foundation for feeding kids, the statement said. Also speaking, the Convener and initiator of the Community Pot project said, Mrs Kemi Jeje, said, “We want to make an impact. We want to make a difference through the initiative.” She noted that one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations is in alignment with the purpose of the project. “According to statistics, 420,000 children die yearly in Nigeria as a result of malnutrition and until one sees one of them, it is just a number one is hearing,” Jeje said. She said about 2.5 million children in the country were deemed to be malnourished and the project would try to reach as many of these children as possible.
