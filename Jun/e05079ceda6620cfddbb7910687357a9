A non-profit organisation, Anap Foundation, has stated that in line with its objective of driving Nigerian youths to actively participate in the nation’s electoral processes, it would inaugurate the GoNigeria Hausa rap challenge. The foundation disclosed this in a statement in Lagos on Thursday, adding that the contest which was organised for young Nigerians between the ages of 18 and 34, would serve as an incentive-driven platform that would boost political participation by Nigerian youths. The statement read partly, “These GoNigeria competitions act as an incentivising platform that should also boost political participation by Nigerian youths, as the messaging requires participants to showcase their communication skills beyond entertainment alone, but by also delivering an important message through rap that is consistent with the ongoing GoNigeria advocacy campaign. “The Hausa Rap Challenge will be anchored by Buba Barnabas Luka (Classiq) and the contest will run from Friday, June 10, 2022 to Thursday, June 30, 2022. Only Nigerian youths between the ages of 18 and 34 years and who have Permanent Voter Cards are eligible to participate. Participants are required to send in a 60 seconds rap video, in which they must show their PVCs or registration slip and play with the word PVC in their rap production. “While the thrust of the rap challenge is aimed at engaging Nigerian youths with a strong inclination towards rap to showcase their talents, the real objective is aimed at encouraging Nigerian youths, within the eligibility demographics of the challenge.” Copyright PUNCH.
