Governor of Cross River State and presidential aspirant, Ben Ayade, has appealed to delegates in the All Progressive Congress presidential primary to vote for him. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, which has been scheduled for the primary, the presidential aspirant called on his “colleagues” to support his presidential ambition. He noted that the presidency was a collective project, as he unveiled his strategy for soliciting votes from the delegates. In the statement personally e-signed by him, Ayade said, “I am calling on all my colleagues to support my ambition as PRESIDENT of our great nation. “Mine is our collective project where shared responsibility of the incoming government lies with us all. “My strategy has been quiet, non-controversial but in touch with the entire delegates nationwide. Let me be your last joker. Thank you so much. God bless.” Meanwhile, the APC presidential aspirants from the South-East have written a letter to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to allow the South-East to produce the next presidential candidate of the party. In a copy of the letter obtained by our correspondent on Tuesday, the aspirants urged Buhari to intervene during the convention for “proper guidance”. The letter was signed by Ikeobasi Mokelu, former ministers of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu; state for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, and Mrs. Ken Uju-Ohanenye. Senator Rochas Okorocha was listed among signatories but didn’t append his signature. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
