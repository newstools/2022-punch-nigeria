The National Insurance Commission has urged the Professional Insurance Ladies Association, PILA, to use its position to influence acceptance of insurance in the country. A statement said the Commissioner for Insurance and Chief Executive Officer, NAICOM, Sunday Thomas, said this during the investiture of Margaret Moore as the 14th president of PILA in Lagos. Thomas said PILA, as the foremost female professional body in Nigeria, had, over the years, provided a forum for developing and promoting forthright professional insurance ladies whose attributes would be the highest demonstration of empathy in relating with insurance policyholders. He said, increasingly, insurance was becoming accepted as a social intermediation, rather than a commercial concern, adding that it should be offered and sold in that sense. “Suffice it to say that people are more likely to see the value and benefits of insurance when presented as a social product and with women in the lead,” he said. To the new president and her team, Thomas said, “I am highly confident that you and your team will work assiduously to see that women lead by example in deepening insurance penetration, using your influence as mothers, wives and above all women professionals to challenge the men that indeed you can do better.” On her part, Moore said her administration would strive to have active PILA chapters in all the six geopolitical zones of the federation, with Lagos remaining the hub. While speaking on the PILA Africa project, she said her administration would key into the recommendations of the committee set up in 2013 in The Gambia to work out modalities for the establishment of the body as a pan-African insurance ladies organisation.
