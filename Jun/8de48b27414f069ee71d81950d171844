The Ministry of Power today has explained the reason behind the low electricity supply currently being witnessed across the country. In a statement by the Special Adviser, Media to the Minister, Isa Sanusi, said the low supply was due to the partial shutdown of the Oben power plant. “Other power plants on other gas sources are undergoing planned maintenance and capacity testing,” it added.
