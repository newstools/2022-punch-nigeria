The Anambra State Governor, Chukwuma Soludo, has expressed deep sadness and sense of loss over the death of Army officer and former Chief of Staff of the defunct Biafran Army, General Alexander Madiebo. Madiebo died on Friday, June 3, 2022, at the age of 90. A statement by the Press Secretary to the governor, Chris Aburime, on Saturday, said the governor regretted that Madiebo died at a time his wise counsel was needed in moving the state ahead. He expressed gratitude to God that the deceased lived a worthy life and died at a very advanced age. It said, “On behalf of my family, the government and the good people of Anambra, I express my sincere condolences on the passing of a great patriot, courageous soldier and officer gentleman, General Alexander Madiebo. “Though we would have loved him to still be with us, we take joy that he lived a life of service and accomplishment. “His contributions to nation building and development of his immediate environment, remain strong reference points in patriotism and nationalism. “He put his life on the line in protecting his people when it mattered most. It is gratifying that while in the battle fields, he kept notes that enabled him to write one of the greatest books about the Nigerian civil war, ‘The Nigerian Revolution and the Biafran Civil War’. “We will surely miss his wise counsel and exemplary life of service to the fatherland. “It is my prayer that the good Lord will grant his noble soul eternal rest. May his immediate family and other relations have the fortitude to bear the pains of his exit, knowing that he led a worthy life.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
