Napoli manager, Luciano Spaletti, is confident of moulding Victor Osimhen into one of the world’s most feared strikers next season, The PUNCH reports. Spalletti, who guided the Partenopei to a third-place finish in the Serie A last season, also hopes no “indecent” bid is made for the 23-year-old during the transfer window. Osimhen finished as Napoli’s top scorer last season with 18 goals and has been linked with a move away from Naples with Arsenal, Real Madrid, Newcastle United, Liverpool, Bayern Munich and Manchester United all reportedly interested in the Super Eagles striker. The Partenopei are holding out for €110m for the Nigerian striker, who has three years left on his current deal, according to a report on Corriere dello Sport. “He (Osimhen) is a potential that can still be improved and made more profitable for the team,” Spaletti told Tuttosports. “Osimhen has healthy selfishness of a centre forward who shoots as soon as he sees the goal and a physically overwhelming power that he expresses above all with his head and this characteristic is very popular in the Premier League. “But I hope that in the end, no indecent proposal arrives at Napoli, so that I can shape this raw jewel, to make it shine even more because technically he still needs to improve. “I hope to coach him for a long time.” The 21-cap Nigeria international has scored 10 goals and provided six assists for the national team thus far. He is expected to return to the Eagles’ starting line-up when they host Sierra Leone in a 2023 African Cup of Nations qualifier in Abuja Thursday.. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
