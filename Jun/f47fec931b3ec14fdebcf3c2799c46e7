Midfielder Oghenekaro Etebo believes a win over Sierra Leone in Thursday’s 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Abuja will usher in a new dawn for the Super Eagles under Jose Peseiro, following their failure to qualify for the Qatar 2022 World Cup, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Etebo, who is one of the five midfielders listed for the game, stated that the team must return to winning ways to earn the trust of the country’s teeming fans again. The Eagles have failed to win in their last five games, losing three – against Tunisia, Mexico and Ecuador and drawing two with Ghana over two legs during their Qatar 2022 World Cup playoffs. “The most important thing for us is that if we want to win we must start now,” Etebo told the NFF Media ahead of the clash. “The game won’t be easy because the last time we played them (Sierra Leone) at home in Benin City, we were 4-0 up, but we lost focus and ended up drawing the game 4-4. “In Freetown, it ended in a draw too but that has passed now. We need to start taking our games seriously and amass every point, so we can qualify for the AFCON. “As a team, we must start this campaign with a win.” On new Eagles coach Peseiro, the former Watford and Galatasary midfielder said he hopes his reign will make the nation proud. The Portuguese tactician replaced Gernot Rohr after the German was sacked last November. “I have known him for a long time, while I was playing in Portugal. I read about him and I hope he does well to make the nation proud.” Peseiro lost his opening two games against Mexico and Ecuador and will be hoping he begins his AFCON qualification on a winning note against the Leone Stars in Abuja.
