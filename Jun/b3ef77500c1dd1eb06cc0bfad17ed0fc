Former Arsenal forward Alexandre Lacazette has rejoined French side Lyon on a three-year deal. The 31-year-old former France international was a free agent after seeing out his contract with the Premier League club, which officially expires on June 30. Ligue 1 side Lyon confirmed on Thursday that they had re-signed the player, a product of their own youth system, who they sold to The Gunners in 2017. Lacazette joined Arsenal on a five-year deal from Lyon for a club record fee of £46.5 million in the summer of 2017 and has scored 71 goals in 206 appearances in all competitions for the Gunners. At the time of his move to London, he had won 11 senior caps for France and has since made a further five appearances. Lacazette scored six goals and made eight assists in 36 appearances for Arsenal during the 2021/2022 season as they finished fifth in the Premier League, just missing out on a UEFA Champions League place.
