Edo State indigenes all over the world have set up a group of professionals, UNUEDO Renaissance,  aimed at enabling the government to find solutions to the problem of insecurity in order to achieve lasting peace and sustainable development. The group held its first in the series of webinars that focused on issues and challenges bedevilling the state on Sunday, to find immediate, medium to long-term solutions. In a communiqué issued at the end of the event, a copy of which was made available to The PUNCH on Wednesday, the group disclosed that it drew the participation of over 100 Edo sons and daughters from across the globe who raised their concerns about the need to make the state safe and secure for indigenes and visitors to thrive in an atmosphere of peace for the needed progress, growth and development of our various communities. The President of UNUEDO Renaissance, Mr Nuhu Yakubu, said the aim was to offer a platform for the security personnel in the state to discuss developments and compare notes with indigenes and residents who are at the receiving end of their services.
