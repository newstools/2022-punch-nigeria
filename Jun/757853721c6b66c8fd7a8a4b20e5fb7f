Some residents of Empire area of Surulere, Lagos State, are soliciting for help for a homeless lady who they said has been living under the bridge for over a year after her late husband was reportedly imprisoned at Kirikiri correctional facility for stealing alcohol. One of the residents, Kenneth Obaraye, revealed how he met the lady and his investigations about the whereabouts of her husband. He also mentioned how he had gone to religious houses around the area asking for help for the lady. Another resident, Isreal Pius, said the lady usually sleeps in front of his shop. He said he was able to get her a job with Lagos State Waste Management Agency but she lost the job after she was knocked down by a tricycle. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
