The State Commandant, Ekiti Amotekun Corps, Brig. Gen. Joe Komolafe (retd.), said on Friday that security agencies in Ekiti State had taken proactive steps to prevent terror attacks on public places in the state and were on the alert. Komolafe also called on residents in the state to be vigilant and be willing to volunteer information to assist security agencies to checkmate crimes. The Amotekun Commandant, who spoke with Saturday PUNCH, said, “Not only Amotekun, all the security agencies have put our heads together and we have taken steps to prevent such a thing. “Apart from that, everybody in the state – individuals, churches, mosques, malls, markets, business places, event centres and schools among others – should try as much as possible to have the telephone numbers of security agencies around them in case of emergency and in case you notice anything, you can call, the reaction time will be very short. “People should be very vigilant, if you see strange faces, do not be afraid to accost them or report. If you do these, they will know that you are vigilant.” Komolafe, who said Christians and Muslims have been going to their places of worship all along, however, assured, “On Sunday, people could go to their churches to serve their God. All they need to do is to be vigilant. Be your brother’s keeper. All the security agencies in the state are on the alert.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
