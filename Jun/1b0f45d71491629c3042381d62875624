Dr Umar Ardo has emerged as the governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party in Adamawa State. Ardo, a former chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party and ex-aide to former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, defected to the SDP after several unsuccessful attempts to clinch the PDP governorship ticket. Ardo, who contested the governorship position of the SDP unopposed, was declared the winner of the primary through affirmation. The primary was held at the conference hall of a hotel in Yola. In his acceptance speech, Ardo promised to address headlong the root cause of misery for most residents of the state by tackling the developmental challenges such as severe economic problems, insecurity, widespread poverty, hunger and weak governance systems.
