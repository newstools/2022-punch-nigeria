The event which is themed, “The role of government regulations in the ease of doing business”, has been scheduled to hold later this month in Ikeja, Lagos. The Chief Executive Officer of ADVAN, Mrs. Ediri Ose-Ediale, said that the ‘The ADVAN Industry Dialogue’ would be an exclusive platform for the deliberation of issues affecting the marketing community in Nigeria. She said, “This year’s edition will focus on the topic, The Role of Government Regulations in the Ease of Doing Business.” She noted that the dialogue sought to provide a meeting point for critical stakeholders in the marketing communications industry and various regulators in order to proffer global best practice solutions on effective regulations for economic growth.
