Three people were feared killed in a renewed cult clash in Ilorin, Kwara State capital on Monday night over battle for supremacy. Punch Metro gathered that the attack which occurred around Omoda roundabout in the metropolis paralysed social and commercial activities as residents and shop owners scamper for safety. Although, the Kwara State Police Command claimed officially that only one casualty was recorded, residents confirmed that two others were gunned down around Oju-Ekun area in the metropolis. Mallam Sofiullahi, a resident, said the suspected cultists trailed two members of a rival cult group to the area and shot sporadically, killing one in the process. “Two others were rushed to the hospital including one Hausa commercial motorcyclist who was hit by a stray bullet”, he added. Another source told our correspondent that the “cultists” later headed to Oju-Ekun area which is very close to the first scene where they also killed two people. The Police Public Relations Officer, Ajayi Okasanmi, who confirmed the incident however noted that “we only have record of one death (yet) and one person has been arrested in the latest attack”.
