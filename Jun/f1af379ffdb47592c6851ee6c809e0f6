Some political thugs loaded in five buses reportedly attacked members of the Social Democratic Party in Itaji Ekiti and Oye Ekiti all in Oye Local Government Area of Ekiti State. In the incident which reportedly happened on Saturday, the political thugs were said to shoot indiscriminately at the campaign rally venues of the SDP. The Director of Media and Publicity of Segun Oni Campaign Organisation, Mr Jackson Adebayo, made the claim in a statement made available to journalists. Adebayo narrated that the thugs began to shoot when the SDP governorship candidate, Segun Oni, was addressing SDP members and supporters at Itaji town. “Three SDP members were shot and terribly wounded in Itaji but luck ran out for one of the thugs who missed the bus and was arrested by party supporters who handed him over to the police. “It took the mobile police and some soldiers on patrol about 30 minutes to bring the situation under control. The unlucky thug confessed that they were sent,” he said. At Oye, Adebayo alleged that the attackers shot three members of the SDP waiting for the arrival of Oni who was due to address party supporters in the town. “The thugs entered their buses and fled on seeing the mobile policemen that were following the campaign convoy of the SDP and the soldiers that were on patrol. “Notwithstanding the hullabaloo, at Itaji and Oye, the people trooped out en mass to welcome Oni, promising to vote for him. “The SDP candidate was told to go and sleep as nothing can change their support and love for him. “The injured SDP members have been taken to the hospital while the matter was reported to the Commissioner of Police,” Copyright PUNCH.
