The Chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Marwa (retd.), has suggested drug tests for youth corps members when they resume for the mandatory one year national service in their various orientation camps across the country. Marwa said it was part of the agency’s drug demand reduction efforts. The chairman made this statement at the NDLEA headquarters in Abuja on Wednesday while hosting the Director-General of the NYSC, Brig. Gen. Mohammed Fadah, and his management team. He said, “There is the need for drug test for our youth corps members as they report at the orientation camps. “Once they know there will be drug test at the camps, they will abstain from it. The whole essence is to ensure help gets to those who test positive early. This is part of our War Against Drug Abuse initiative. “Nigeria has a drug issue. We are determined to ensure this is changed but we can’t do it alone, we need organisations like NYSC to reduce and control demand for drugs. Nigeria has insufficient rehabilitation and counselling centres. We need counselling centres in the primary health care centres at the grassroots, where we don’t have enough manpower to cover and this is where the young men and women of NYSC come in. “We can train them in their numbers to serve as counsellors at the grassroots level because the majority of drug users only need counselling.” NYSC DG said he came on a courtesy visit to commend the efforts of the agency and also seek support as orientation camps prepare to admit new corps members.
