Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, has emerged as the All Progressives Congress senatorial candidate for Ebonyi South in a rescheduled primary election. Umahi finished sixth in the APC presidential primary in Abuja on Wednesday, where a former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, was declared the winner with 1,271 votes. Two weeks ago, the governor’s younger brother, Austin Umahi, was declared the winner of the senatorial primary election for Ebonyi South. However, after Umahi’s loss, the APC cancelled the earlier primary election and rescheduled it for Thursday night. Umahi clinched the APC’s ticket in the rescheduled primary election, held at the Afikpo North Local Government Council. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
