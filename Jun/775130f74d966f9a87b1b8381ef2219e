A medical expert and patron, Tinubu Support Organisation, Dr. Adebayo Orire, has advised the All Progressives Congress to vote right in its presidential primary holding next week with a view to choosing the best as its candidate. Orire said the APC national leader and presidential aspirant, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, towered above all the aspirants in the aspects of competence and ability to address the country’s problems. “We in the TSO share the conviction of many Nigerians and we are sure the former Lagos State governor is capable of winning the general election and can fix Nigeria”, he said. Orire, who spoke at a press briefing in Ado Ekiti on Wednesday, said, “Tinubu has proven to everybody that he can do it. He has been developing talents; he has developed governors, ministers, senators, ambassadors. He has plans, he can change this country for the better, he has the experience, exposure and capacity.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
