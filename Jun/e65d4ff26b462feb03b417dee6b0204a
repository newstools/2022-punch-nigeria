There was jubilation in Osun State as a retired visually-impaired teacher, Mr Aniobi John, received a bond certificate of N8.3m from the state government. John described the gesture as the best thing to happen to him, noting that the state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, had rekindled his dashed hope. He was among the 162 retirees who benefitted from the N1.156bn bond certificates presented to a set of pensioners by the state government. The beneficiaries were primary school teachers, local government staff, civil servants who served in ministries, departments and agencies and the state-owned tertiary institutions. John told our correspondent that the gesture was a great relief to him and his family, given what they had passed through since he retired from active service. John, who retired in 2016 after 35 years in service, burst into tears of joy for being a beneficiary. He decried the delay in the payment of his pensions, which he said ought to have been paid before the previous administration left office.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
