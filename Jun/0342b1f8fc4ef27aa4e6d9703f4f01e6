The newly inaugurated Chairman of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators of Nigeria, Olufemi Sokan, has said he would focus on capacity enhancement of members. He said this while giving his acceptance speech during his investiture and other executives of the chapter in Lagos. The event was attended by stakeholders in the industry, chieftains in the financial sector and other top government officials. This Sokan said, “This administration will focus on capacity enhancement of our members, especially the upcoming ones, and the opportunity to participate more in richly packaged governance programmes. We promise to have many free events and programmes for our members. “We will equally execute an impactful mentorship programme to help young members grow.” He also said he would focus on improved welfare of  members through new initiatives. Some of the initiatives, he said, would be to assist members, especially the upcoming ones, to enjoy the benefits of internship. He said he would creatively work on increasing sources of funds for the chapter. The new chairman said, “We will ensure a better visibility of the chapter. This will be achieved by taking ICSAN back to the grasroots. One key way we intend to achieve this is to organise governance rallies showing the importance of it in our rallies.” Some of the new executives sworn in during the investiture were: Ololade Olude as  vice chairman; Adebusola Iyamu as secretary; Onubogu Chinwe as treasurer; Efosa Ewere as mobilisation secretary; and Oladayo Akinlemibola as financial secretary.
