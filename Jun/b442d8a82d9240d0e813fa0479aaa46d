A former lawmaker representing Anambra Central Senatorial District, Senator Ebenezer Ikeyina, has emerged as the factional presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party for the 2023 general elections. The PUNCH reported that the Shehu Gabam-led SDP is presenting a former governor of Ekiti State as its candidate in the June 18 governorship election in Ekiti State. SDP said contrary to reports, the party was not factionalised. The Chairman of the National Convention Organising Committee, Chief Mike Odunrinde, who presided over the presidential primary of the SDP, said out of the 311 delegates accredited, 308 voted in favour of Ikeyina. The factional acting National Chairman of the SDP, Chief Supo Shonibare, while addressing delegates at the national convention of the party in Abuja, said the party’s candidates for various elective public offices at the federal and state levels would beat their opponents in the 2023 general elections. He said, “It may not be as quickly as we think but we are confident that we will prevail. And one thing I can assure you is that we will not back off. We will continue to extend an olive branch to the other tendencies who we know were never elected.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
