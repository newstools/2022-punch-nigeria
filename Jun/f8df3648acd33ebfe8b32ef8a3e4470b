A United States of America-based singer, Sam Olatunji, aka Prexy Sam, has said that for him, music is beyond a means of entertaining people, but a calling for him. He told Sunday Scoop, “I started my career in an acapella group. Now, we are incorporating contemporary gospel worship and praises into our music. My band, The Retum Brodaz, specialises in using pidgin English to drive home our messages. “To me, it is not just about singing to entertain people, I consider it to be a calling. No man can do ministry all alone; we need people. That is why I will always sing in a group. However, I could release solo albums (from time to time) in order to give more expression to what I am called to do.” On how he has been able to manage his band over the years, Olatunji said, “We are one big family. People can come in and go whenever they want. However, there are some who play active roles (in the band), and they have been with us for a while. Everyone cannot be part of the band; they have to be ‘called’ into it. Understanding the vision (of the band) is also very important.” Speaking about his latest projects and the challenges he faces at this stage of his career, Prexy Sam said, “I just released a single titled, Mighty God, and it is available on digital stores. The Retum Brodaz album is also coming. We (band members) are currently working on a soon-to-be-released song titled, Hallelujah to You. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
