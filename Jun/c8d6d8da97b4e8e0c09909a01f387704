Nigeria international, Cyriel Dessers, is set to return to Genk when his loan deal expires today after Feyenoord failed to reach an agreement with the striker to sign him on a permanent deal. Dessers joined the Dutch side from Genk on transfer deadline in the summer, with the Eredivisie side retaining the possibility of keeping him in Rotterdam for €4m. The 27-year-old striker had a fantastic season with Feyenoord, guiding them to the final of the maiden UEFA Conference Cup final, the club’s first major European final appearance in more than a decade, where they lost 1-0 to Roma. The Nigerian also finished as the tournament’s top scorer with 10 goals ahead of fellow finalist, Tammy Abraham, who scored nine goals. His performance was enough to convince De Stadionclub, as they are fondly called, to raise the required €4m to sign him from Genk. However, according to a Dutch website, HLN, both Feyenoord and Dessers have not been able to reach an agreement on personal terms. “Cyriel Dessers (27) has not found a personal agreement with Feyenoord about a definitive transfer,” the website wrote. “In principle, the striker will return to Genk, unless the team from Rotterdam makes an extreme offer tomorrow (Wednesday), when the deadline expires.” In the just concluded season, Dessers scored a total of 20 goals across all competitions.
