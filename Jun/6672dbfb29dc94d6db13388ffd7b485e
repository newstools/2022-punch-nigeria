Nollywood actress, Mary Njoku, has noted that the industry was arguably controlled by women. In an Instagram post on Saturday, the founder of ROK TV noted that women “sign almost all the cheques.” This is as she narrated how a family member wrote her off as “an actress whose career refused to blow”. She said, “Dear women, women are doing big things too! Few weeks ago, a family member needed a guarantor for her rent and I went to the lawyers office to sign. “I spent over 45 minutes trying to convince her I can afford the rent but she didn’t believe me. She thought I was an actress whose career has refused to blow. She needed proof that I am truly the Founder of ROK or the CEO of the studio. “I googled my name but she didn’t agree. In her eyes, I can’t be me. I am a small girl. The agent and I begged her to do her small research but refused. “I told her I will get the CEO of IROKOTV to co-sign but she said I was calling big big names. She insisted on seeing my business card. I had none. Business card that I can write anything on! “I had to call a male colleague whose career is ‘stronger’ than mine to help be the guarantor. She was a fan and super happy. “I was sad for her. She lives in a box; an old one.” “Today, Nollywood is arguably controlled by women. We sign almost all the cheques! But I guess I am too young and too simple to be ME. “I had no entourage. I waited at their reception. I was super polite to her. She even asked for the name of my grandfather’s village. I was nice. Yet she insisted on being a fool. Sad.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
