Popular Disk Jockey, Imohiosen Patrick, popularly known as DJ Neptune, on Monday lamented the absence of immigration officers at a Nigerian airport. Sharing a video of himself and other persons at the airport on his Instagram page, the record producer noted that he arrived in the country in the early hours of Monday. He added that on his arrival, there were no immigration officers to stamp their passports, as they all formed a long queue. Though he didn’t mention the name of the airport, his video showed people in a long queue, who were apparently waiting for immigration officers to get their passports stamped. The producer wrote, “Just arrived into the country ‘Nigeria’ 4:15 am and there is no Nigerian Immigration officer on duty to stamp our passports.” He noted that the absence of immigration officers was an indication that there was “serious trouble” in the country. “(It’s) safe to say there is serious trouble in the land from top to bottom,” DJ Neptune said.
