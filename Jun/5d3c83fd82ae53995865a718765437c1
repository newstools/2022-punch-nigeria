The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has congratulated Asiwaju Bola Tinubu on his emergence as the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress. Aregbesola said Tinubu’s victory at the party’s special convention was a hard fought one, describing Tinubu as a dogged fighter. These were contained in a statement the minister personally signed on Wednesday. The statement read, “I write to felicitate with you on your hard fought victory at the just concluded Presidential Primary election of our great party, the All Progressives Congress . “You have demonstrated once again that you are a dogged fighter and in your quest for the establishment of a democratic society, you are willing to go the whole hog. “It is my prayer that you will ride on the crest of the momentum of this triumph to lead our party to victory in next year’s general elections. “On behalf of my family and our associates, I heartily congratulate you on this well deserved victory.” Aregbesola and Tinubu had a frosty relationship after the minister, in February, accused the presidential candidate of betraying him. The late Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi and the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, was said to have begun a move to reconcile them before the Alaafin’s death. The Minister of Interior in a statement to mourn the passage of Aalafin said the monarch was still working to settle their rift before his death. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
