A group, Ife Youths Organisation, on Friday, threatened to resume protest over the emergence of Prof. Simeon Bamire, as the Vice Chancellor-elect of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State. The group in a statement signed by its national coordinator, Abimbola Afolabi, also advised the general public to stay clear of OAU premises beginning from Monday when the protest would commence. The management of the university had already slated Tuesday for the inauguration of Prof. Bamire as the 12th substantive Vice Chancellor. The PUNCH reported that the announcement of Bamire as the VC-elect had sparked off protest by some indigenes, who accused the outgoing Vice Chancellor, Prof. Eyitope Ogunbodede, of manipulating the selection process against a candidate backed by the Ife community. Ife indigenes, in its statement which partly read declared that “Contrary to the belief of the outgoing Vice Chancellor, we shall not relent on the struggle except justice is seen to have been done. “Without any jabberwocky, we strongly advise the general public to stay clear of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife premises from Monday, June 6, 2022, as we resume our peaceful demonstration, this time with every sense of commitment. “While we remain hopeful that the concern authorities will do the needful before the said date, we shall continue to open communication channels for meaningful and progressive intervention.” Copyright PUNCH.
