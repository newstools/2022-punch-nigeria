The Southern Kaduna Concern Youth Group has called on the Peoples Democratic Party governorship flag bearer in Kaduna State to pick the incumbent lawmaker representing Kaduna South Senatorial District, Sen. Danjuma La’ah, as his running mate. Chairman of the Group, Mr. Samuel Adamu, in a statement issued in Kaduna on Thursday, said his selection will guarantee the victory of the party at the general election. He explained that Senator La’ah who has the support of the grassroots in Southern Kaduna, will in no small way boost the chances of the party winning the election in Kaduna State. Adamu expressed optimism that Senator La’ah has been a loyal party man, having served at the senate as the only PDP Senator in the Northwest Zone of the country, but has refused to decamp to the ruling All Progressives Congress despite intimidation. The chairman pointed out that the only way the PDP can reward Senator La’ah’s loyalty is for him to be on the ballot as Deputy Governorship Candidate with Isah Ashiru Kudan in the 2023 polls. He, however, called on the party faithful to continue to rally around and campaign for all the candidates of the party across the board for success. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
