Super Eagles assistant coach, Finidi George, says the men’s football senior national team is in the rebuilding phase following a series of disappointing results. The Eagles in January crashed out of the Africa Cup of Nations in the round of 16 following a perfect performance in the group stage. The three-time African champions also saw their dreams of appearing at the Qatar 2022 World Cup dashed after losing out to Ghana on goal aggregate, a result which led to the exit of interim coach Austine Eguavoen in March. The Nigeria Football Federation May announced Portuguese Jose Peseiro as the new Eagles head coach with Finidi as the first assistant. In the Portuguese first game, Nigeria lost 1-0 to Mexico in an international friendly at the AT&T stadium in Texas. As the team prepare for their second game under the tutelage of the former Real Madrid assistant coach, Finidi in an interview with the NFF media team said he was happy with the team’s training session as they continue with the rebuilding of the team. “We’ve had a couple of sessions, while in Dallas and I think we liked it. We are building and the building process has started and we’ll see how far we can push the players. It’s been good so far. Let’s see how the second game will go,” he said. “It’s not easy, just a week with the players and he’s giving the players more information. By the time we get to the qualifications, I think the players will know what’s expected of them in the Super Eagles of Nigeria. “It’s still a building process and a draw won’t be a bad result. If we have the victory, we will take it. If we can have a draw and play a good game, we will all accept it and go back home and build on that.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
