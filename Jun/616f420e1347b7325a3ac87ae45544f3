The Governor of Ekiti State and All Progressives Congress presidential aspirant, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has condemned the attack by terrorists on Christian worshipers at St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State, in which scores of innocent people are feared killed during a Holy Mass on Pentecost Sunday. Fayemi, who is the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum, described the attack as “vile, barbaric and callous”, adding that “there can never be any justification for the heinous behaviour of the assailants.” The governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, titled, “Fayemi condemns Owo killing”, said, “The perpetrators of this dastardly act should not go unpunished. We call on relevant security agencies in the state to spring into action and ensure that they are brought to book.” In solidarity with the sister state, Fayemi directed the Ekiti State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Banji Filani, to immediately send human and medical resources to Ondo State. Fayemi, who commiserated with his Ondo State counterpart, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, said, “Our condolences to the government and good people of Ondo State as well as families that lost their loved ones in the carnage.” Copyright PUNCH.
