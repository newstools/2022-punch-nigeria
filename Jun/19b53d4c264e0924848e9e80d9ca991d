It was a moment of celebration as one of the aides of singer Davido, Isreal Afeare, formally met the family of his fiancée ahead of their marriage. The introduction ceremony took place on Saturday in Benin, the Edo State capital, Isreal DMW revealed on his Instagram story. Sharing photos and videos from the event, Isreal wrote, “Introduction fully done and dusted.” See photos of the ceremony below:   The introduction comes barely two months after Isreal proposed to his fiancee. Shortly after the proposal, Davido had gifted the bride-to-be a sum of N500,000 to buy “airtime.” This is not the first time that Davido would extend his generosity to Isreal, his personal logistics manager. In January 2022, Davido gifted Isreal a brand new Toyota Venza. The logistics manager had later revealed that the car was bought for N8.5m. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
