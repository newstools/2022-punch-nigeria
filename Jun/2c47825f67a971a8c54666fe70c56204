A delegate from Enugu State and former High Commissioner of Nigeria to India, Major General Chris Eze (retd.), has accused the leader of the delegates team from his state of manipulating the delegates’ list. The aggrieved delegate told our correspondent that they were being cheated and he felt the world must see the corruption ongoing in his state. According to him, the list they previously had was different from this until they got to the accreditation venue at the International Conference Centre, Abuja, and saw a different list. He said, “The list of delegates from Enugu, presented by their leader simply named as Ogo is not the authentic list of delegates. “We are law-abiding people, so we are not going to fight anybody but we want the world to know that the list was manipulated.” Copyright PUNCH.
