The National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party has presented a Certificate of Return to the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. Abubakar won the party’s presidential ticket during a special national convention held in Abuja on May 28 and 29, 2022, after scoring 371 votes to beat 11 other aspirants. Governors, governorship candidates, presidential aspirants, members of the Board of Trustees, members of the National Assembly, and critical stakeholders among others graced the ceremony. The event was held on Wednesday at the PDP National Secretariat, Abuja. Atiku said, “My chairman, my dear friends, while I am excited and happy for this opportunity to bear our party’s flag, let us all remember that what just happened is a contest within a family to decide how to put our best foot forward. The main contest is the one to win the Presidency of our country for our Party. “And it requires the entire PDP family and other supporters and sympathizers. We must pull everyone together. Nobody should be excluded. “I have already visited some of those who contested against me as a way to lead in that effort to unify the party so that we can face our real opponents, defeat them in the elections and begin the process of rescuing and rebuilding this country. “The callous and dangerous APC misrule over the past seven years is there for everyone to see. “However, we should not take their defeat for granted. We must unite and work extremely hard for every single vote in this country.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
