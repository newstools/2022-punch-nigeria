The Independent National Electoral Commission has expressed concern over the lack of interest by youths in voting during elections. The INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner for Osun State, Prof Abdulganiy Raji, disclosed this during an engagement meeting that the commission held with identified youth groups, National Youth Service Corps members, and persons living with disabilities and albinos in Osogbo on Tuesday. Speaking on the theme of the meeting, ‘Role of youths in Osun governorship election,’ Raji expressed hope that after the meeting, the youth in the state would be convinced and the attitude of not voting during the election would change. He said, “Ever since this period, the registration of young people has remained over 60 per cent of the entire registered voters, but this huge number has not been reflecting positively in the number of people who vote and exercise their franchise during elections. “The disposition of our young people to voting in elections calls for serious concern. So, the commission is not out of order by organising today’s engagement meeting with identified youth groups in Osun State. “It is our strong belief and we are convinced beyond reasonable doubt that today’s meeting with you will provide the needed impetus in changing the old narrative of not voting in elections or being used by the inordinate political class who believe in election violence as a means of achieving their selfish political interest.”  Copyright PUNCH.
