Almeria striker, Sadiq Umar, believes the Super Eagles are on the part of writing history after their World Cup failure, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Umar, who played the last two minutes of the Eagles’ 1-1 draw against Ghana in Abuja last March – a result that dashed the qualification hopes of the three-time African champions for the Qatar 2022 World Cup, said the team would not disappoint as they kick-start their 2023 AFCON qualifying campaign against Sierra Leone. Ghana held on to a crucial 1-1 draw in Nigeria and qualified for the 2022 World Cup on away goals after the first leg of the play-off finished in a goalless draw in Kumasi. Ghana bagged a crucial away goal through Thomas Partey after 10 minutes, with Nigeria equalising after 22 minutes through a William Troost-Ekong penalty, but the Black Stars held on to book a place in Qatar later this year. “It was a tough moment for us after the team failed to qualify,” Umar told PUNCH Sports Extra. “But we are ready to do the nation proud when we face Sierra Leone on Thursday.” “It was a big mistake (not going to the World Cup). Next time, it will not happen again. “We have every player hungry and ready to deliver for the country. It’s a fresh start and I believe we will not disappoint.”  Copyright PUNCH.
