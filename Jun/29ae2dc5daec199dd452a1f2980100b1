A truck laden with a 20ft container overturned on Saturday at the Oyingbo Rail Crossing, Yaba, Lagos. The incident injured a male passerby and blocked a section of the road. According to a statement by the Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, the truck driver drove on the bad sections of the road, and overturned into the rail tracks. “Upon arrival at the incident scene, an articulated truck laden with a 20ft container was found at the railway crossing at the aforementioned location. “Further investigation revealed that the truck driver poorly navigated the bad sections of the road and as a result, the truck overturned onto the rail tracks. No life was lost but an adult male passerby was injured as a result of the incident. “The agency’s heavy-duty forklift has been dispatched to evacuate the truck off the rail track to eliminate a secondary train accident.  Unfortunately, the operation is being hampered by miscreants at the scene. Request for armed intervention by Nigeria Police has been made,” the statement read. In a follow-up response to inquiries by Sunday PUNCH, Oke-Osanyintolu noted that the truck and container had both been recovered from the rail track onto a nearby lay-by. He stated, “The axis is now safe for both rail and road traffic. Recovery operations have also been concluded.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
