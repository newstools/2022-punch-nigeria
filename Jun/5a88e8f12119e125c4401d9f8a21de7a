The Ebonyi State Police Command on Wednesday confirmed the collapse of a five-storey building in Abakaliki. The building, which was under construction, is located in the Presco area of Abakaliki metropolis. It was gathered that construction workers ran out of the building a few minutes before it went down. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Chris Anyanwu, during an interview with journalists, said “no casualty was recorded.” On a visit to the scene of the incident, our correspondent observed government officials inspecting the collapsed building to ascertain what went wrong with the structure. Residents said the building collapsed at about 6 p.m. on Tuesday.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
