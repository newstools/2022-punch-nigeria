BtoB Events, organisers of Food & Beverage West Africa, has said that the trade show will return to Lagos in two weeks’ time. According to a statement, the exhibition will run from June 14-16 and will have more than 220 exhibitors from five continents taking part. The statement said the event would place a real focus on promoting Nigerian food and beverage products. With more than 40 countries represented, visitors will have an opportunity to find out about the latest local and international food and drink developments and to sample products launched in Nigeria and the region. Managing Director, Jamie Hill, said: “After the huge success of FAB West Africa 2021, I cannot wait to bring the largest edition of the Food and Beverage West Africa exhibition back to Nigeria. It will be the first exhibition to utilise the new third hall at the Landmark Centre, perhaps making it the largest food and beverage exhibition on the African continent. “This year’s exhibition has seen an incredible increase in demand for exhibition space and will host exhibitors from across 40 countries and 5 continents. The previous edition back in September 2021 was a huge success, despite certain COVID-19 and travel restrictions. “This is the first edition since international travel was relaxed, so we have seen a surge in demand for exhibition spaces. This exhibition will sell out so should you want to exhibit, get in touch today.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
