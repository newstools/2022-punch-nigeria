Nollywood actor and politician, Desmond Elliot, on Monday, celebrated his wife, Victoria, on the latter’s birthday. The member of the Lagos State House of Assembly representing Surulere 1 shared a picture of the celebrant on his Instagram page and showered her with praises. He described his wife as his most treasured gift and reaffirmed his love for her. Desmond wrote, “You are indeed my most treasured gift, a joy, a sister, lover, friend and teacher. I thank God for yet another birthday celebration, Babamai. “I wish you the best; just the best. May you always be happy and fulfilled. I love you so dearly and wish you a very happy birthday, darling.” The couple celebrated their 18th year in marriage on December 26, 2021. The actor faced criticism during the period of the #EndSARS protest due to comments he allegedly made on the regulation of social media while in the Assembly chambers. Though he initially denied making such comments, the video was released online and the actor-cum-politician was thoroughly bashed on the Internet. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
