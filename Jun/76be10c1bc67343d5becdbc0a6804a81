Mixta Africa, a real estate company, has launched an innovative solution that aims to tackle the country’s growing housing deficit. The firm said it aimed to reduce the financial pressure of the home-buying process for customers through a rent-to-own process. It said in a statement that the solution termed the ‘Rent-To-Own’ scheme offered flexible and accessible opportunities to live in one of Mixta Africa’s upscale, beautiful, and serene communities on a lease while working towards the option of an outright purchase and complete ownership at the end of a fixed three-year period. It catered to the middle-income segments of the housing industry, focusing primarily on working families in Lagos, the statement said. Speaking on the new initiative by the company, the Chief Commercial Officer, Mrs Rolake Akinkugbe-Filani, said “The scheme is designed to ease the financial stress attributed to the process of home-buying for potential customers and leverages the experiences of other payment schemes in Lagos to provide a superior solution. “This new scheme makes a considerable proportion of Mixta Africa’s more affordable real estate holdings available to willing customers.” Copyright PUNCH.
