The United States Consulate has celebrated the accomplishments of Carrington Fellows of the 2021 cohort The United States government exchange programme brings together Nigerian youths with vision, skills, and experience to design and implement projects that have a positive impact on their local communities. The US Consulate hosted a graduation ceremony celebrating the success of 17 young Nigerians who formed the 2021 cohort of the Carrington Youth Fellowship Initiative. The graduating fellows ranging from ages 21 to 35 years were selected through a competitive process and have implemented social service projects focused on health, education, civil liberties, environment, and economic empowerment during the 12-month long fellowship. While delivering the remarks during the graduation ceremony,  the US Consulate Public Affairs Officer, Stephen Ibelli, highlighted the positive impact the initiative has had on local communities since its inception in 2011. He commended the graduating fellows for their selfless service and commitment to the values championed by the late US Ambassador to Nigeria, Walter Carrington, for whom the initiative is named. In a goodwill message delivered at the event, the wife of late Ambassador Carrington, Dr Arese Carrington, congratulated the 2021 cohort and urged them to remain exemplars of honesty and concern for the welfare of the less privileged.
