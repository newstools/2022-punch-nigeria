Kidnappers operating on the Okigwe/Uturu/Aba Road in Abia State have abducted a photographer attached to the Press Unit, Ebonyi Government House, Abakaliki, Mr Uche Nwube. Nwube was kidnapped on Wednesday while returning from Aba, Abia State. The victim, it was gathered, made calls to his colleagues to inform them about his abduction after he was instructed to do so by his captors. He was quoted to have said his abductors demanded N50m for his release or he would be killed. One of the kidnappers also reportedly spoke to a journalist, saying the N50m must be brought to them by 10am on Thursday or they would kill him. PUNCH Metro gathered that journalists in Abakaliki, on Thursday, approached the Ebonyi State Police Command to report the incident. However, the police directed the journalists to approach the Abia State Police Command. But the Ebonyi State Commissioner of Police, Aliyu Garba, said he had directed his men to liaise with their counterparts in Abia State to ensure that the victim regained his freedom. Copyright PUNCH.
