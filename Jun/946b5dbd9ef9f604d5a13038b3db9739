The Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Ponyan Ward, Yagba East Local Government Area, Kogi State, Bunmi Ipinnaiye, has reportedly committed suicide in a Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps cell. Ipinnaiye was arrested by men of the NSCDC for the attempted murder of his son, who was said to be fraternising with some boys who were allegedly involved in social vices. Our Reporter gathered that the deceased had attacked his son with a machete on their way to the farm and the incident was reported to the Civil Defence, which led to his arrest. A source, who spoke on condition of anonymity said upon interrogation, the late APC chairman refused to respond to questions and was left in one of the rooms in the security outfit office. When the officers returned to resumed interrogation, he was found dead after using his belt to commit suicide by hanging himself. Efforts to confirm the incident from the Public Relations Officer of Kogi State Command of the NSCDC proved abortive as his phone was switched off. Also, the police public relations officer of Kogi State Command, SP William Aya, promised to get back to our correspondent after finding out from the Divisional Police Officer of the area, but had yet to get back as of the time of filing this report Copyright PUNCH.
