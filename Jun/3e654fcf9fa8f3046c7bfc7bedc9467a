The Lagos State Sports Trust Fund has reaffirmed its support for the ongoing renovation of the Mobolaji Johnson Indoor Sports Hall at the Rowe Park Sports Centre, Yaba stating that it will be completed by August. LSSTF secretary, Olaposi Agunbiade, lauded the Lagos State Lottery Board and Chief Kessington Adebutu for their support in ensuring that the facilities got a facelift. “We have all realised that government cannot fund sports alone and we at LSSTF have decided to seek support from the private sector, we must acknowledge the huge backing we received from the Lagos State Lottery Board as well as Chief Adebutu, who made it possible for us to get to this stage of the project. We are still seeking the support of well-meaning individuals in Lagos for us to do more in terms of sports infrastructure,” he said. Agunbiade promised that the LSSTF would continue with the donation of sports equipment to public secondary schools in the state, adding that there were plans to present more to the six educational districts next month. The project contractor Niyi Lawal said, “Most of the works are near completion. In a few weeks, we should be handing over the volleyball, handball and basketball courts, while we still need a few weeks to finalise works on the swimming pool based on the quality of materials we’ve been using on the project.  We hope that by August, we should be quitting the site and handing over the facilities to LSSTF.” Copyright PUNCH.
