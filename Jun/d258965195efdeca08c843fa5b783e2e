Presidential aspirant, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has promised to rehabilitate the displaced people of Bakassi if elected president. He made the promise on Wednesday in Calabar when he came to consult delegates ahead of the party’s forthcoming presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress. Tinubu said,”We will create jobs, we will rehabilitate those displaced in Bakassi,” adding that he will make Calabar port functional. Tinubu, who came with an entourage including the Governor of Kano state, Abdullahi Ganduje, told the delegates to vote for success and progress and that they should ask about his achievements in Lagos. “I can turn Nigeria around. We will bring back Nigeria’s prosperity. We will create commodity markets. Economic prosperity will be there for you and your children,” he said, adding that he will replicate his achievements in Lagos nationwide if elected president in 2023. Former governor of Borno, Hashim Shettima, said equity, justice and fairness demand that power must go to the south, and that Tinubu deserves the job because he has made a huge sacrifice to sustain democracy. Ganduje also supported zoning the presidency to the South, saying Kano would swing votes in favour of Tinubu. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
