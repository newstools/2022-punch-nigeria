Speaking after receiving the award, Joel said, “When we look at the world around us, it is easy to see that technology is changing at an exponential rate. The world economy is more connected than ever and the competition is just as high. “We need to keep changing not only the culture inside our companies but also the culture in the social, commercial and public sectors. We also need to encourage shared progress and equal opportunities for everyone.” Prunedge also bagged two awards: Software Company of the Year and ICT Services Implementation & Support Company of the year.
