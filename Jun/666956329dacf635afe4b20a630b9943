Liverpool have confirmed the departure of Sheyi Ojo and six other players including striker Divock Origi when their contracts expire at the end of this month. The 24-year-old who played on loan at English Championship club Millwall last season – his sixth since he joined the Reds from MK Dons in November 2011, departs having made 13 appearances and scored one goal against Exeter in the FA Cup. Origi spent eight years on Merseyside and sealed the Reds’ stunning comeback to sink Barcelona 4-0 in the Champions League in 2019. Announcing his departure, Liverpool wrote, “Divock Origi will leave the club when his contract expires at the end of June. “Thank you for an incredible eight years of service and leaving us with so many special memories. Liverpool legend.” Goalkeeper Loris Karius and former first-team player Ben Woodburn have also been released, along with three members of the club’s academy. Karius became notorious for his error-strewn performance in the 2018 Champions League final against Real Madrid, and spent much of his subsequent Anfield career on loan. Woodburn became the club’s youngest goalscorer – a title he still holds – when he scored in the League Cup match against Leeds at the age of 17. Academy players Elijah Dixon-Bonner and Luis Longstaff – who made first-team appearances in domestic cup competitions – have also been released.
