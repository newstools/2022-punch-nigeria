Goodness! “How can you just kill people like this? How? Like their lives mean nothing! What should happen to their families?? Their loved ones, friends, colleagues?? “What has happened to the right of every citizen to life? There is no justification for this madness!” Rapper Eva Alordiah tweeted, “Everyday it’s a new sad story that could have been avoided. Unnecessary evils and waste of life all round. “So very sad! Sending love to everyone who is hurting right now. May Nigeria not happen to us and the ones we love.” “No! What terrible news is this!”, rapper Ladipoe lamented on his Twitter page.
