The Independent National Electoral Commission has assured Nigerians that they would get feedback concerning the calls for the extension of the Continuous Voters’ Registration. The INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, made this known during his speech at a political concert in Lagos. Sharing a picture of Yakubu at the concert, a tweet from INEC on Saturday read, “We have heard your requests loud and clear. You will soon hear from us on the extension of CVR registration. “Please assure me that you will register, pick your PVCs and Vote. I also assure you that your vote will count.” The exercise was scheduled to end on the 30th of June, 2022 but there have been calls for its extension. The concert tagged, ‘Youth Vote Count 2.0 Mega concert’, is geared toward creating awareness of the need for youths to register and vote in the forthcoming 2023 general election. The concert attracted a mammoth crowd which assembled at the Tafawa Balewa Square in Lagos. INEC, Yiaga Africa, and the European Union are among the sponsors of the event which included performances from top Nigerian artistes. Nigerian female singers, Omawumi and Waje, thrilled the fans who defied the rain to turn up at the event. Some celebrities who attended the event include Falz, Mr Macaroni, Real Warri Pikin, Broda Shaggi, MI Abaga, and a plethora of many others. The Chairman of INEC, Prof Mahmood Yakubu; Lagos State Resident Electoral Commissioner, Olusegun Agbaje; and other members of the commission were present at the concert. Copyright PUNCH.
