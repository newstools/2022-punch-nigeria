Emmanuel Dennis continues to attract interest from Premier League clubs, as his future seems increasingly likely to be away from Vicarage Road. Crystal Palace and Brentford are the latest two sides to be credited with an interest, as preparation begins for the 2022/23 season. Reports in Nigeria in recent weeks have linked the striker to the two clubs and sources have since supported them. Palace are looking to add extra firepower to their team, with only Wilfried Zaha reaching a goals tally in double figures in the recently-finished campaign. Dennis’ representatives have touched base with a number of sides already, including West Ham United and Villarreal, but his options are only increasing for the time being, with Palace and the Bees throwing their hats into the ring. With Brentford, the situation appears a little more complicated. Top scorer and talisman Ivan Toney has attracted interest from other teams, after a successful return to the Premier League, in which he scored 12 goals. Whether or not Dennis would be seen as a replacement for Toney should he depart, or an attacking partner, is not yet clear. Either way, it suggests that there are at least three clubs who could potentially make a move for the Nigerian, who is currently away on international duty with the Super Eagles. Watford value him around the £20m mark.
