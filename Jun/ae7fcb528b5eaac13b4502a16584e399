Former Big Brother Naija season 6 housemate, Peace, has addressed her noticeable absence from social media shortly after the show ended in October 2021. In the reunion show which premiered on Thursday night, she opened up on why she took a break off social media. Peace noted that she took a break from social media because she needed to strategise and make plans. She said, “I just needed a break. You know how this thing can be sometimes. I needed to take some time. I needed a break. I needed to strategise.” Reacting to her new hair colour, Ebuka said, “And you came back blond.” “I came back blond and happy,” Peace said. Peace’s absence became more noticeable when she didn’t go with the housemates to a trip to Dubai, which they won during the show. At that time, some fans rumoured that she was pregnant but she refuted the claims. During her stay in the house, Peace was the first ever Head of House for the BBNaija Shine Ya Eye edition. Peace, Michael, Boma, and Tega were evicted from BBNaija six weeks into the show. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
