A faction of the Labour Party led by its former Deputy National Chairman, Callistus Okafor, on Wednesday elected Chief Digar Ezenwafor as its presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections. Ezenwafor, immediate past Senior Special Assistant to Ex-Governor Willy Obiano of Anambra State on Politics and Strategy, emerged as the LP faction’s candidate at a national convention held in the Garki area of Abuja. He is also said to have worked with a factional presidential candidate of the party, Peter Obi, as his Chief of Protocol during his first term as governor of Anambra State. Okafor presided over the convention in his capacity as the party’s acting national chairman. Ezenwafor told the party’s delegates that he was on a rescue mission to Nigeria. He said, “I am on a rescue mission to free Nigerians from social, economic and political crises currently bedevilling it.” He said having understudied two former governors in Anambra State, he has what it takes to lead the country to economic freedom. Okafor said his position and actions were based on the need to ensure justice, fairness and equity stressing that he had nothing against Obi, who had been presented by the other faction as its presidential candidate.
