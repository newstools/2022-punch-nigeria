The Speaker of Cross River State House of Assembly, Eteng Jonah-Williams, has called on Nigerians to come out en masse and register for the Permanent Voter Cards ahead of the 2023 election. The Speaker said this in a statement signed by his Press Secretary, Mr Hope Obeten, on Sunday in Calabar. Jonah-Williams said that it was only through the PVCs that Nigerians can exercise their voting right for the candidate of their choice in 2023. He urged Nigerians to take advantage of the ongoing registration exercise and obtain their PVCs if they wanted a change in 2023. The Speaker charged Nigerians not to lose hope with the leadership in the country as there were clear signs that the country was on its way to gaining the full dividends of democracy. He urged young Nigerians to participate more in the country’s democratic process both at the local, state and federal levels. Jonah-Williams said that even though the country was faced with various challenges in its march toward nationhood, Nigerians should roll out the drums and celebrate the 23 years of its democracy. He urged Nigerians not to forget the devastating effect of military rule and how past dictatorships had stunted the growth of the country. The Speaker used the occasion to call on leaders to build institutions of governance so that the country’s democracy would stand on “sure footing” for the benefit of the future generation. (NAN)
