The Nasarawa State Police Command says it has rescued the two kidnapped children of a former commissioner of the National Population Commission in the state. The PUNCH had reported that the former NPC commissioner, Zakari Umaru-Kigbu, was attacked and killed by gunmen who stormed his residence last Saturday at Azuba Bashayi in the Lafia Local Government Area of the state. After killing Umaru-Kigbu, the gunmen kidnapped two of his children and took them to an unknown destination. Speaking to our correspondent in Lafia on Friday, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, ASP Ramhan Nansel, said officers of the command located the hideout of the kidnappers in the Nasarawa Eggon LGA of the state and went after them with full force, but the hoodlums escaped, leaving the children in a bush in the area. He said, “We were able to locate the hideout of the kidnappers on Wednesday, at a mountainous location in the Nasarawa Eggon LGA and due to the pressure our personnel mounted on the kidnappers, they were forced to release the victims. “The victims were immediately rushed to the Dalhatu Araf Specialist Hospital, Lafia, for medical examination, after which they were reunited with their family.” While warning all criminal elements to leave the state without delay, Nansel said the Commissioner of Police, CP Adesina Soyemi, had directed that a proper investigation should be conducted on the matter in order to arrest the perpetrators of the act.
