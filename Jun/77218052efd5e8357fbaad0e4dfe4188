The Niger/Kogi Command of the Nigerian Customs Service has seized 101 exotic cars and other vehicles alongside clothes, rugs and consumables worth N755.3m. This was revealed in Minna on Monday by the command’s Area Comptroller, Abubakar Adamu, while showcasing the seized items. He stated that the consumables seized include cartons of bottled water, wine, ketchup, spaghetti, Basmati rice, tomato soup, foreign parboiled rice, whipped cream, vegetable oil and others.

He said among the items seized are 140 rolls of foreign rugs, 50 bales of second-hand clothing, 920 kegs of Premium Motor Spirit, eight motorcycles and 200 pieces of used tyres. “The Cumulative Duty Paid Value for all the seized items amounted to N755,377,866.00,” Adamu stated. The comptroller said the success was recorded due to the massive intelligence deployed during the operations, adding that no casualty was recorded as the rules of engagement were applied during the operations.
