The St Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State, was on Sunday attacked by yet-to-be apprehended armed men. The attack led to the loss of many lives and bloodied pews. As usual, there has been an outpouring of condolence messages and many government officials traipsing the scene of the attack, the palace of Olowo of Owo, Oba Gbadegesin Ogunoye III and the office of the Ondo State governor, Rotimi Akeredolu. However, the questions Nigerians are asking are, ‘How did we get here?’ How can we get out of this dreary place where human lives have no value?’ Listen:  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
