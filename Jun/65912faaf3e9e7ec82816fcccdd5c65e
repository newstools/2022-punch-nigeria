Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has stressed the need for the southern part of the country to produce the next president. Ayade spoke when the national leader of the All Progressives Congress and presidential aspirant, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, visited him at the Government House, Calabar. Tinubu, according to a statement by his Media Office on Wednesday, was accompanied on the visit by Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje; former governor of Nasarawa State, Tanko Al-Makura; former governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima; and former Senate Leader, Victor Ndoma-Egba, among others. “Zoning is a provision of our constitution to ensure balancing. It should not be about ethnic or regional domination, but balancing. It is the turn of Southern Nigeria in 2023,” Ayade said. While describing Tinubu as a trans-generational leader and political strategist, the governor said he has the capacity, experience and exposure to lead and is more than qualified to be Nigeria’s President. The APC leader had told Ayade who is also contesting for President that there was no collision in their desires. Tinubu said, “Mine is to respect you as you respect me. I appeal to you as your senior brother and the first to declare his intention, not to endorse me today but when you get to Abuja, you can endorse me fully. “We must have that unity of purpose. We must work together not only for the unity and economic development of Cross River, but also of the country. We owe that to the present and future generations.” Copyright PUNCH.
