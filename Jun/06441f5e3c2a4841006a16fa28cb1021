Anambra State Governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo, has said democracy all over the world is a continuous struggle towards a better society. Soludo stated this during a special church service to mark Nigeria’s June 12 Democracy Day celebration at the Governor’s Lodge, Amawbia, on Sunday. The governor stressed that nation building was a consequence of class and social struggle. He said that values such as focus, determination and perseverance are indispensable in this kind of struggle. According to him, there is no perfect society anywhere in the world, accounting for various contestations and contradictions, adding that they bring out the best in society. He pointed out that, for Anambra indigenes, it’s a struggle to build a liveable and prosperous homeland where everybody had very fundamental roles to play. Soludo recalled that Nigeria had consistently fought against dictatorship during which time many people even paid the ultimate price. He stressed that the sacrifices by the late MKO Abiola and others, in the course of the struggle that gave rise to the Democracy Day celebration, would not be taken for granted. Copyright PUNCH.
