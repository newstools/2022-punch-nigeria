Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has declared that his administration has recorded over 75 per cent success rate as far as service delivery and electoral promises made by him are concerned. The Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Taiwo Adisa, disclosed this in a statement made available to journalists on Sunday. He quoted the governor as saying that the policies and programmes of the government in education, health, security and economic expansion have brought a positive turnaround to the state. Adisa said the governor stated these on Saturday at a live interview programme, Meet the Governor, hosted by the state-owned Broadcasting Corporation of Oyo State and aired live by radio stations across the state. Speaking on the just-concluded Peoples Democratic Party’s convention, Makinde said he had put the developments at the national convention behind him, stating that the party would do what is necessary to rescue Nigeria. Makinde, who stated that though a Northerner emerged as the party’s presidential candidate despite the decision by southern governors that the Presidency of Nigeria should rotate to the South, it has become imperative to work together so that Nigerians could be saved from the maladministration of the All Progressives Congress. The statement further quoted the governor as saying that the PDP leaders have resolved to chase away the APC as the first condition towards rescuing Nigeria. He said, “We have seen the outcome of that presidential primary but it is what it is. In politics, if you cannot get what you desire, you look at where you are, evaluate and see how best you can deal with your situation.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
