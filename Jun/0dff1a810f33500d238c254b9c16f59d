The Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, Qu Dongyu has said the youth have the potential to transform agrifood systems and make them more efficient, more inclusive, more resilient, and more transparent. In an open letter published on the agency’s website to mark the World Environment Day annually celebrated on June 5, the FAO chief said this year’s theme was ‘Only One Earth.’ He said, ‘‘The youth are catalysts for change who have the potential to transform our agrifood systems to make them more efficient, more inclusive, more resilient, and more transparent. ‘‘They are the global agents of change for better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life for all, leaving no one behind. We must ensure that youth are in the driver’s seat of their future,’’ Dongyu  said. Dongyu added that global harmony could be attained by recognising and respecting the rights of people. He said, ‘‘Youth, including young professionals, who make up a large proportion of the global population, are and will continue to be disproportionately affected by the crises facing our planet, such as the impacts of climate change, ecosystem degradation, biodiversity loss, hunger and malnutrition, water scarcity, access to energy, and health for all. Without our immediate action, they will inherit an uncertain future.’’  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
