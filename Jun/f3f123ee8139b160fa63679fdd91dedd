Former Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State says the powerful cabal in the Presidency is planning to give All Progressives Congress leader, Bola Tinubu, the ‘MKO Abiola’ treatment at the presidential primary of the APC. Fayose said this in an open letter to Tinubu on Monday which he personally signed. MKO Abiola was the acclaimed winner of the June 12, 1993, Presidential election but was denied victory after the result was controversially annulled. He was eventually detained by the military government of General Sani Abacha the following year for declaring himself President. He died four years later. In his open letter, Fayose said it was obvious that Tinubu was swimming against the tide and he needed to proceed with extreme caution. The letter read in part, “Going by the handwritings that are now clearly on the wall, if I may consider sir, I see you as one that may be swimming against the political tide of the cabal in your party. They are equally preparing for your actions and reactions and are fully set to contain same as they did to both Awolowo and Abiola.” Fayose said unfortunately Tinubu’s empire – which comprised almost all the six South-West governors and ministers as well as Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo – had been balkanised as evidenced by Tinubu’s outburst in Abeokuta last week. The ex-governor added that the responses to the Abeokuta outburst by some of Tinubu’s allies in the North and the South were clearly something to worry about. He added, “Unfortunately, your kingdom has been badly balkanised if what happened in Abeokuta is anything to go by. The book of Proverbs 22 verse 3 reads, ‘Sensible people will see trouble coming and avoid it but unthinking people will walk into it’.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
