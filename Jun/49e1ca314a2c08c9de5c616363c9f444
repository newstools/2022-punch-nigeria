The Deputy Governor of Delta State, Deacon Kingsley Otuaro, on Sunday, distanced himself from a group calling on the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, to nominate him as his running mate. While calling on members of the public to completely disregard the statement from the group, the Deputy Governor insisted that the said statement by the Southern Nigeria Liberation Movement was issued without his knowledge. Otuaro’s position was contained in a statement issued on his behalf by the Director of media and publicity of the KBO campaign organisation, Arex Akemotubo, copies of which were made available to journalists in Warri. He further stated that his main focus as the Deputy Governor of Delta State “is to support the Governor of Delta State, Dr. Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa to finish strong politically and in the provision of infrastructures for Delta State.” The Deputy Governor reiterated that he had no connection whatsoever with the group called Southern Nigeria Liberation Movement or any other group fronting same matter. He, therefore, called on those he tagged “mischief makers” to stay clear. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
