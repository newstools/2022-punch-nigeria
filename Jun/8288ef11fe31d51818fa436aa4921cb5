Popular singer and self-acclaimed leader of Marlian FC, Azeez Fashola, aka Naira Marley, on Sunday, May 29, 2022, hosted his debut album listening party. The 14-track album is titled, ‘God’s Timing’s the Best’. According to the singer, he chose that titled because there were certain things he had been trying to but they didn’t work out until God decided that it was the right time. While on stage at the event, the singer said, “What’s up, my people. I thank everyone for coming out here. God’s time is the best. In my life, I had been trying to plan a lot of things in my own time and they did not really work out. “Like me coming to Nigeria, EFCC arresting me and then letting me go. “God’s timing is the best because this album came at God’s time. I could have released it a long time ago but I ‘dropped’ it now.” Other artistes that thrilled guests at the listening party included Marley’s label mates, Oniyide Azeez, aka Zinoleesky; and Ilerioluwa Aloba, aka Mohbad, among others. Zinoleesly and Mohbad performed the songs they were featured in on the album. Prior to the release of this new album, the singer had two Extended Play albums titled, ‘Lord of Lamba’ and ‘Gotta Dance’.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
