The governorship candidate of the Labour Party in Benue State, Herma Hembe, on Saturday called on the leadership of the All Progressive Congress in the state to stop mentioning his name in their activities. Hembe stated this in a statement made available to our correspondent in Makurdi that he did not participate in the governorship and rerun primary of the APC held on May 29 and June 9, 2022, respectively. The national secretariat of the party had ordered a rerun of the governorship primary following a protest by some defeated aspirants in the May 29 primary, which was won by the suspended Catholic priest, Rev Fr Hyacinth Alia, who also won the rerun. Hembe, a serving member of the House of Representatives, said having withdrawn from the governorship race and resigned his membership of the APC, he did not participate in the primary and stressed that at the time the rerun was conducted, he had emerged the gubernatorial candidate of the Labour Party. He described as mischief the continuous mentioning of his name as a participant in the APC governorship primary. He stated, “I gave notice to the party through my counsel of my withdrawal from the gubernatorial primary of the APC. The notice was served on the party on the morning of May 26, 2022, several hours before the party purportedly changed the mode of election from indirect to direct primary. “I followed up my notice of withdrawal from the race with a notice of resignation of the APC membership, which was served on the APC Chairman of the Mbake Ward, Konshisha Local Government Area.
