Actor, Shawn Faqua, has urged entertainers not to depend on awards for their validation. The African Magic Viewers’ Choice Awards nominee told Sunday Scoop, “I don’t believe entertainers should depend on awards for validation. I believe one’s work should speak for one. If the validation comes, it would just an icing on the cake. The cake itself is the work that one puts out constantly, and that is what would guarantee that one keeps getting jobs. Sometimes, these things can be flawed. It (awards) is not a confirmation that what one is doing is right or wrong. It just feels good that people recognise and appreciate one’s work.” On how he felt about his AMVCA nomination, the Soole actor said, “It feels great to be nominated. It is good that the work we put in is being recognised on such a scale.” Faqua also stated that finding balance, mentally and spiritually, can help one maintain relevance in the industry. The actor also noted that he will like to feature in a biopic. He said, “There are quite a number of roles I will love to play that I have not had the opportunity yet. For example, I will love to act in a biopic.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
