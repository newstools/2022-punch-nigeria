Seven people have been confirmed dead in a road crash at Agbede, in the Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo State. The crash, which happened around 11am on Sunday, involved 14 vehicles, comprising one Sienna bus and 13 trucks. An Assistant Route Commander and Public Education Officer of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Edo State, Miss Omozie Inegbenebor, confirmed the incident in a statement on Tuesday. According to her, 25 adults were involved in the crash, which led to the death of seven persons. She explained that the crash was caused by brake failure from one of the trucks, which ran into another vehicle. Inegbenebor said, “Rescue teams of the FRSC, Edo Command, have been on ground carrying out rescue operations, clearing obstructions and controlling traffic along the area. “The Sector Commander, Mr Henry Benamaisia, while carrying out an on-the-spot assessment of the crash, sympathised with families of the victims and ensured the proper trans-loading of the vehicles spilling fuel and arrival of water tankers to put out the remaining fire.” Meanwhile, the Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has commiserated with the families of victims of the accident. In a statement on Tuesday, Obaseki said the accident was regrettable and would be a major subject for deliberation at the State Security Council meeting in order to unravel the causes and avert a recurrence.
