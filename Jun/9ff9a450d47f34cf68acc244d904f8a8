Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has described as false insinuations in some quarters that he may be asked to step down as presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress in ensuring the party produces a consensus candidate. The governor said he was favourably positioned and had the backing of the real stakeholders in APC ahead of the presidential primary election to clinch the APC ticket. There were reports that Fayemi, who is also the chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum and other four governors held a meeting behind a closed door with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, suggesting that he was being pressured to step down. But Fayemi in a statement issued in Abuja by the Head of Media and Spokesperson of his Fayemi Presidential Campaign Organisation, Femi Ige, described the report as “absolute rubbish.” He said, “No meeting took place between us and any aspirant about stepping down. We are undoubtedly among the leading aspirants for the position and one to watch in the race. “Our candidate has deep trust and respect among political leaders in the party and also from colleague governors who form a critical mass in the decision-making process.” Ige asked Fayemi’s supporters to “remain calm, focused and not losing faith because of the lies fabricated by political detractors, saying no amount of late-night demarketing will work against the Kayode Fayemi Presidential project.” Copyright PUNCH.
