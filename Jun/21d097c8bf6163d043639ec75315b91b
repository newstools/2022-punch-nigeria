Employees of Wema Bank Plc took their Corporate Social Responsibility a notch higher this year by donating a borehole facility to Eko Akete Grammar School, Lagos. This project was executed as part of the Salary for Love initiative, an annual initiative where Wema Bank staff donate their one-day basic salary for community impact projects. Since the initiative commenced in 2018, it has recorded increased success and positive societal impact over the years and over 80,000 people in various communities across Nigeria have benefitted from the Salary for Love initiative of Wema Bank. This year, the Salary for Love initiative was premised on ‘Education and Entrepreneurship’. The theme was informed by the rapid increase in moral decadence and depravity amongst Nigerian youths today. Champions from all the regions across the Bank were nominated to execute selected projects for their respective regions. The Head Office/ALAT Team donated a borehole facility to the students and staff of Eko Akete Grammar School as their Salary for Love 2022 project. This project was chosen to provide potable water for the beneficiaries in line with the Sustainable Development Goals – Good Health & Wellbeing, Quality Education, and Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 3, 4 & 6).
