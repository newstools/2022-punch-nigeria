Bayern Munich have ruled out a summer move for Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The German champions are in search of a new No.9 to replace Robert Lewandowski, who is on his way out this summer. Italian website Corriero dello Sport had reported in May that Bayern were interested in the Napoli striker but on Tuesday, Skysports Germany transfer expert Marc Behrenbeck revealed that the Bavarians could afford the Nigerian, who is currently valued at €110m by the Partenopei. “Yes, he (Osimhen) played a great season, is a really good player, but according to our information it is not currently an issue at FC Bayern,” Behrenbeck said. “Yes, Bayern wants to get another No.9, but it’s not Osimhen. In addition, the requested transfer fee is far too high.” €100m or  €110m? No, no way.” Last season, Osimhen scored 18 goals in all competitions and made six more in 32 appearances as Napoli finished third in Serie A. The 23-year-old is currently with the Nigerian squad in Abuja preparing for Thursday’s 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Sierra Leone.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
