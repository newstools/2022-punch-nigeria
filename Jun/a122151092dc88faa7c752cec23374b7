The General Manager, Lagos State Building Control Agency, Gbolahan Oki, has directed illegal occupants of shanties under power lines at Jiuhua Street, off Mega Chicken, Ikota, in Eti-Osa Local Government Area to vacate the location. According to a statement made available to The PUNCH on Wednesday, Oki issued the quit notice “in order to save the lives of the residents and avoid health implications that threaten individuals who reside beneath or close to power lines.” The statement further quoted Oki as giving the occupants 72-hour ultimatum to vacate the shanties as prior statutory quit notices had been issued last year without compliance. “Reiterating the state government’s commitment to safeguarding the lives and property of the citizenry, through consistent monitoring, enforcement and identification of illegal, distressed and non-conforming structures, the General Manager enjoined all Lagos residents to report all forms of illegality in their locality for appropriate action,” the statement added. Meanwhile, the agency has removed three-floor vicarage, belonging to Christ Anglican Church, at 60/64 Glover Street, Ebute-Metta, “due to its distressed state as well as to avert the danger that the building presently poses to its occupants and neighbours.” Copyright PUNCH.
