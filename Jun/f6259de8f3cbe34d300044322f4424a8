Nigerians took to social media to heap praises on Super Eagles frontman Victor Osimhen, who scored the winner in the comeback 2-1 African Cup of Nations qualifying win over Sierra Leone in Abuja on Thursday, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. This is Jose Peseiro’s first win since he was appointed the Eagles coach in May after previously losing his first two games in charge to Mexico and Ecuador in friendlies played in the USA. Before the win against the Leone Stars, the Eagles had been winless since January. The excitement of the fans on Twitter was therefore appropriate as they had waited long to see their team victorious again and heaped deserved praises on Osimhen, whose goal gave the team the three points. Ayomikun Elemikan wrote, “You can see the zeal in Victor Osimhen anytime he’s on the pitch. Very energetic and always a threat. Top player” Another fan, Agba Woman, wrote, “Star Boy of the show. Victor Osimhen doing the magic work again as usual.” Another Twitter user, @SmartAtuadi wrote, “Both Iwobi and Osimhen goals were powerful goals. Victor Osimhen is a beast. The way he attacked that header is the reason most Premier League Clubs are scampering for his signature. His predatory instincts in front of goal is high up there.” Babajide James went more analytical as he wrote, “You can question many things about Victor Osimhen’s style of play, but you cannot question his instinct of being at the right place at the right time. That positional awareness does almost 70% of his striking job for him. That’s another smart finish by the lanky guy.” It was Osimhen’s 11th goal for the Eagles. The Eagles will now travel to Morocco to face Sao Tome and Principe on Monday. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
