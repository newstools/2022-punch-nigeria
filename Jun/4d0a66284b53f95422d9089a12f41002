Defender Steven Caulker, has admitted that Sierra Leone team gave Nigeria too much respect in Thursday’s 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja, Saturday PUNCH reports. Leone Stars lost 2-1 to the Super Eagles on match day one after goals from Alex Iwobi and Victor Osimhen cancelled out an 11th minute opener from Jonathan Morsay. Reacting to the defeat, the 30-year-old said, “Definitely there are areas to improve on. We are a young team in the rebuilding process. We will take the positives from this game. “When we were 1-0 up we sat back and we gave the Super Eagles too much respect and they took advantage of that scoring two good goals. “There were some decisions which I felt should have gone our way in the encounter we would like to think that when we host the reverse fixture as well such decisions go our way as well. “It is one game there are five move games to go.” The Leone Stars will face Guinea-Bissau in their game in the qualifiers at the General Lasana Conte Stadium, Conakry on Monday.
