Nigerian reality TV star, Natacha Akide, simply known as Tacha, has lamented over how quickly Nigerians move on with their normal activities, following tragic occurrences in the country. She wondered what needed to happen again in Nigeria before the citizens would become “tired” of the situation in the country. The former Big Brother Naija housemate, who was reacting to the recent attack on worshippers in Ondo state, knocked Nigerians in a video shared on her Instagram story late Monday. In the video she shared, Tacha said, “Honestly, Nigerians need to tell me what needs to happen that will make them tired. I need t know what needs to happen again in this country that will make us uncomfortable because we move on too easily. “To the best of my knowledge, everything has happened in Nigeria. Children have been kidnapped, people die in the mosque, and people have died in the church. ASUU is on strike and students are at home. “Unimaginable things happen in Nigeria on a daily basis. So tell me, what needs to happen again? That will cause that call to action to bring everybody together to say we are uncomfortable, we are tired, and we need to cause a change. What?” The Sunday attack on worshippers at St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State, led to the gruesome killing of many, including women and children. Other celebrities like Davido and Mr Macaroni had also condemned the attack. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
