A combined team of the Nigerian Army’s Operation Thunder Strike and the Inspector-General of Police’s Operation Puff Adder have rescued a Chinese national and two others abducted along the Kaduna-Abuja Expressway recently. The Kaduna State Police Command’s Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, who disclosed this in a statement, said the combined operation took place around 7am on Tuesday when operatives battled the suspected bandits at the Sabon Sara village along the Abuja-Kaduna highway. He noted that as result of the superior fire power of the troops, the bandits fled, leaving behind eight operational motorcycles. According to the police spokesman, the rescued victims have been conveyed to the hospital for medical attention while efforts are on to arrest the fleeing bandits. Jalige sad, “The reinvigorated synergy among security forces in Kaduna State has recorded another success today, June 7, 2022 at about 0753hrs as the joint police/military team of Operation Puff Adder and Operation Thunder Strike intercepted a group of  armed bandits while on their odious  mission at Sabon Sara village attempting to gain access to the Kaduna-Abuja Highway. “The operatives observed the suspicious movement of bandits and courageously took the battle to them where severe exchange  of fire ensued as the bandits scampered for safety  and that resulted to rescue of a kidnapped Chinese expatriate and two others, abandoning eight of their operational motorcycles.”  Copyright PUNCH.
