Worried by the heap of refuse littering the streets of Port Harcourt and its environs, Governor Nyesom Wike has set up a five-man taskforce to tackle the menace. The governor in a special government announcement signed by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, said the appointment was taking effect immediately. Refuse evacuation had been a major problem in the city, especially since the former sole administrator of the Rivers State Waste Management Agency, Felix Obuah, resigned his appointment to contest the governorship position in the state. The statement read, “The Rivers State Governor, His Excellency, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, has set up a five-man Taskforce on Sanitation to oversee the clearing of refuse in Port Harcourt and its environs. “Members of the Task Force on Sanitation are Hon Isoboye Jack (Chairman), Hon. Josiah Olu, Hon. Victor Ihunwo, Prince Wali Wosu and Princess Ibiene Ogan. “The appointment takes immediate effect. All members of the Task Force are to report to the Governor’s office, Government House, Port Harcourt by 3:00 pm on Thursday, June 2, 2022.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
