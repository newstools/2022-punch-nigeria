The Nigeria Union of Journalists, Osun State Council on Wednesday insisted on the redeployment of the state Commissioner of Police, Wale Olokode, following attack on some protesters in Osogbo. On Tuesday, armed police from Dugbe Police Division, had stormed Olaiya Junction in Osogbo, the state capital, and fired bullet and canisters at journalists and some youths protesting extra judicial killing of one Abiola Afolabi in Osogbo in April this year by the police. During the attack, a journalist with The Nation Newspaper, Toba Adedeji, and a student, whose identity was not known yet, were shot. Featuring on a radio programme monitored on Rave FM, Osogbo, the council chairman, Wasiu Ajadosu, gave the Inspector-General of Police, Baba Alkali, seven days within which he must redeploy Olokode. Describing police handling of the situation as unfortunate, Ajadosu said, “We are going to pursue this to a logical conclusion. “This gross indiscipline is a result of leadership problem. The CSOs have been shouting and demanding the redeployment of the Commissioner of Police. “We have given the police seven days to redeploy CP Olawale Olokode and we shall continue to make noise until our demands are met.” Speaking in similar vein, spokesperson of The Osun Masterminds, a civil society, Ayo Ologun, also condemned police’s response to the protest. “Shooting unarmed protesters is beyond the rule of engagement,” he said. Meanwhile, Osun Police command has said probe has been launched into the attack. A statement signed by the command spokesperson, Yemisi Opalola, said the CP had visited the wounded journalist.
