The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari, on Sunday evening at the Aso Rock Villa, met separately with former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, and the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan; both of whom were presidential aspirants at the just concluded Primary election of the All Progressives Congress. The meeting comes barely two days after the presidential candidate of the party, Bola Tinubu, met Buhari on a thank you visit to the Villa. Although the matters discussed with Amaechi were not disclosed, Lawan who spoke after his session with the President said the party was still grappling with challenges it inherited since 1999. “I want to make a promise to Nigerians on behalf of my party that APC at the state and national levels will always do things that would matter for the lives of the ordinary Nigerians and why we are failing is not because we want to fail. It’s because we are challenged and we are only eight years old. “We had a political party that was in power for 16 years and most of the problems that APC met at the state and national levels are issues sown a long time ago since 1999 and some were there before 1999. “We have done a lot. I am a chief participant in this administration and I know just how much has been invested in the infrastructure of this nation and how much we have invested in empowering the youth,” he said. Both former aspirants are visiting the President for the first time since the presidential primary election. No official statement was released after the closed door meetings.
