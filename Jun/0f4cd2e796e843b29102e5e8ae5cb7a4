Enugu Rangers captain, Tope Olusesi, has promised the supporters of the club a good outing when they take on Nasarawa United in a match day 33 fixture at the New Jos Stadium on Sunday, (today), PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The vastly experienced right-back admits that the game will be tough but reckons he and his teammates are battle-ready to banish the nightmare of their last visit to the same venue three weeks ago. “I believe that we are in Jos for business and this will be displayed on the pitch on Sunday. There is no room for too much talk because we know what happened to us in our last visit here and we don’t want a repeat but to redeem our image and get back to winning ways,” Olusesi said. The Flying Antelopes lost 4-0 to Plateau United in their last visit to the New Jos stadium three weeks ago. With only a solitary point gained on the road in the second stanza as against 14 points recorded in the first stanza, Olusesi expressed confidence of the team churning more going forward. “Really, it has been very challenging but I have that strong belief that we shall start getting points on the road starting with this second visit to Jos.” Rangers currently occupy the third spot with 51 points from 32 matches as against 41 points for Nasarawa United from the same number of matches and occupying the 11th spot in the ongoing season. Both sides under quality managers will battle with all in their arsenals to wrest the three points at stake.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
