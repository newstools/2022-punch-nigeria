The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) on Thursday evening received the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, at his official residence inside the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Tinubu was accompanied by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State. Earlier the President had urged the Progressives Governors Forum through its Chairman, Governor Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi State, to rally round Tinubu to ensure victory in next year’s election. Buhari made the appeal in a letter addressed to Bagudu. He wrote, ‘‘I was pleased to see how you were very professional and efficient in handling the sensitive political position of Chairman Progressives Governors Forum.” Copyright PUNCH.
