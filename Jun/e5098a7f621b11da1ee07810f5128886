Fabrizio Romano, an Italian transfer market expert, has revealed English Premier League club Arsenal are yet to contact Napoli over a deal for Victor Osimhen despite continuous speculations linking the Nigeria with a move to the North London club, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The Super Eagles striker is undoubtedly a target for Mikel Arteta, who are in the market in search of a new striker following the exit of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Barcelona in January and the impending departure of Alexandre Lacazette. Osimhen had a fantastic season at Napoli, scoring 18 goals in 32 appearances across all competitions. The 23-year-old was also named the Italian Serie A Most Valuable Player for U-23 footballers last season and has been one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe ahead of the transfer window with Arsenal believed to be leading the race for the Nigeria international. However, according to Romano, contrary to previous reports, there have been no conversations between the parties thus far, despite media speculation that the striker’s intermediary recently travelled to London for contract talks with the Gunners. “As of today, I am not aware of an advanced negotiation for Victor Osimhen to Arsenal,” Romano told caughtoffside. “So far there is no proposal on the table, sources close to the club guarantee. “Arsenal are waiting for answers from Gabriel Jesus, who is the priority target, but who also interests other clubs.” Osimhen’s contract is set to expire on June 30, 2025, although Napoli is said to be open to proposals in excess of €100.
