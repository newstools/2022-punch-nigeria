Nollywood actress, Ivie Okujaye Egboh, has announced the birth of her third child. She shared a picture of the “miracle baby” via her Instagram page on Wednesday, as the mother of three revealed that the delivery of the child was preceded by long labour. “Verified. And baby is here!!!!! Our Miracle Baby, the one that completes us. So grateful. Heart so full,” she wrote in the caption. “That smile when it’s all over and you’re holding your baby in your arms. Labour was long. Like, really long. I thought y’all said labour gets shorter with subsequent babies? Can’t explain how relieved I was when it was all done. So thankful, Lord! So so thankful.” The Amstel Malta Box Office winner got married to her husband, Eze Egboh, in 2015. They both welcomed their first child and daughter in July 2016, while their second daughter was born in July 2018. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
