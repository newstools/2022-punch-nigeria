The Love Water Borehole Project has donated a water project to Jakande Ilasan community in Lekki, Lagos State. At the inauguration of the project on Tuesday, the sponsor, Mrs Naomi Alabi, said she grew up in an environment without clean water. This, she said, made her to realise that water is a luxury everyone needed to have. “I grew up in Kano and the area I grew up in required me to go somewhere far to fetch water. “Now that I have it better, I have decided to create awareness on water being a luxury everyone needed to have, especially communities such as this,” she explained. The Chairman, Jakande Ilasan Housing Estate Community Development Association, Mr Sulaiman Kazeem, who was represented by the secretary, Toheeb Ademola, noted that the project will benefit the community in terms of water availability. “I am honoured and privileged to be a part of this project which has made water easy to get for the community. “This community has been suffering from lack of clean water for a long time, we thank God for this solution,” he said. A resident, Patience Ukpomg, also expressed excitement over the project. “Over the 10 years I have been in this community, there has been lack of clean water. We are left to buy water, N150 is a keg of water and the price keeps increasing,” she said.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
