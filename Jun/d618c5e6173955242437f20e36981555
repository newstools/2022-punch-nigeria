Premier League club, Crystal Palace, are preparing a bid worth £25m for Glasgow Rangers’ Nigerian midfielder, Joe Aribo, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The 25-year-old has also been linked with a move to Aston Villa and Brentford, according to several reports. The 25-year-old has become a key figure at Ibrox under both Steven Gerrard and Giovanni van Bronckhorst, playing a huge part in the Scottish side’s league title in 2020-21, as well as their run to the Europa League final last season, where he scored a goal as the Gers’ lost 5-4 on penalties after regulation time ended 1-1. Aribo was utilised across a variety of roles in midfield and the forward line during the 2021-22 campaign, in which he managed to score nine goals and register eight assists in 57 appearances for the club across all competitions. “Premier League outfit Palace said to hold a ‘serious interest’ in signing Aribo this summer,” The Athletic reports. “A £25m bid is being prepared for him to bolster the squad ahead of the new season.” The report also claims that Aribo is one of the few key stars at Rangers that could be sold this summer in order to generate significant funds to reinvest into this summer’s transfer budget, with the midfielder one of several players entering the final 12 months of his contract at Ibrox in the coming weeks. Were Aribo to make the move to the Eagles, he would be competing with the likes of Wilfried Zaha, Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze for a place in Patrick Vieira’s starting 11 next season.
