Three pastors have been abducted by suspected kidnappers in the Ofu Local Government Area of Kogi State. The PUNCH gathered that the pastors were on their way to minister at a three-day crusade when the suspects intercepted their vehicle along the Ochadamu-Okele-Ejule Road on Friday. The kidnappers, thereafter, whisked the clerics away. A source in the family of one of the pastors, while speaking with our correspondent, said the kidnappers had made contact and demanded N80 ransom. The police command in the state confirmed the kidnap, saying that it had drafted policemen to the area to secure the release of the victims. The state Police Public Relations Officer, William Aya, said, “The command is aware and efforts are on to effect their release.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
