The corporation’s latest monthly and financial report for August said the sum was earned from March 2020 to March 2021 after it lifted a total of 108 million barrels of crude oil within the year, at an average price of $43 per barrel. A breakdown of the report showed that in March 2020, the oil and gas firm lifted approximately 9, 490mn/b; 11, 437mn/b in April; 5, 113m/b in May; 6,274mb in June; and 8,546m/b in July.

The crude, NNPC said, was lifted from the daily allocation for domestic utilisation translating to an average volume of 243,650 barrels of oil per day in terms of performance.

In order to meet domestic product supply requirements, NNPC said all the barrels were processed under the Direct-Sales-Direct Purchase (DSDP) scheme while no deliveries were made to the domestic refineries for processing. The country’s official exchange rate during the period was around N400 to the dollar. Going by an average of N400/$, the various average monthly costs of Brent and the monthly crude oil production figures as stated above, NNPC said it earned approximately N71bn in March; N69bn in April; N46bn in May; N90bn in June; N136bn in July; N170bn in August; N130bn in September; N158bn in October; N156bn in November; and N145bn in December 2020.

Nigeria earns about 90 per cent of its revenue from mostly export of crude oil. The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, 11 Plc and former Chairman, Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria, MOMAN, Tunji Oyebanji, told The PUNCH in an interview that Nigeria’s dependence on oil revenue would not give room for adequate growth of other sectors of the economy.
