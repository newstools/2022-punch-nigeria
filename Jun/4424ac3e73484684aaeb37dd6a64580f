The Board of Trustees of the Peoples Democratic Party has met former Vice-president and the party’s standard-bearer, Atiku Abubakar, behind closed doors. The meeting was held on Wednesday evening, in Abuja, led by the BOT chairman, Senator Walid Jibrin. The BOT and the party’s standard-bearer had in the aftermath of the presidential primary held in May scheduled a meeting to discuss the subject of who will be the running mate to Abubakar. A source close to the BOT told our correspondent that the meeting between Atiku and members of the BOT was an interactive session surrounding the 2023 elections, challenges Nigeria faces, as well as the unity of the party. The meeting may also not be unconnected to the subject of selecting a running mate for the former vice president. Those in attendance were former vice president Namadi Sambo, former governor of Jigawa State, Dr Sule Lamido, former Imo State governor, Senator Emeka Ihedioha, former Kaduna State governor, Ahmed Makarfi, former President of the Senate, Senator David Mark, Prof. Jerry Gana and a host of others.
