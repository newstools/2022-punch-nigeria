Mr Uchenna Nwube, the Ebonyi State Government House photographer, has regained his freedom after three days in kidnappers’ den. Nwube was kidnapped on Wednesday around 7pm on the Okigwe-Aba-Enugu Expressway. He was abducted in the area, while returning to Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, from Aba, Abia state. His neighbour and family friend, Mr Simion Ituma, told the News Agency of Nigeria that Nwube was released on Saturday. Ituma explained that the victim regained his freedom alongside his friend’s mother-in-law, who was with him. He stated, “Yes, he has been released, but right now, he is at the Ogwu Police Station, Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State. “He was taken to the police station to enable him to settle with the officers of the Nigeria Police. You know his car was taken to the police after he was abducted. “I must tell you, he is free and in good health as well as his friend’s mother-in-law. Thank God for everything.” The photographer, it was gathered, had made a distress call to his colleague to confirm his abduction after he was instructed to do so by his captors. He was quoted to have said that the abductors were asking for N50m for his release. A friend of the photographer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told our correspondent that Nwube was released early on Saturday by his captors after his family and friends paid a ransom of N300,000. “Yes, Mr Nwube has been released. We thank God. The kidnappers collected N300,000 for his release. Let’s give God thanks,” the source said.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
