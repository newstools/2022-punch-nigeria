The Federal Character Commission has distanced itself from the purported news linking it with the call for submission of curriculum vitae to fill vacancies in the medical field across the country. The FCC said this following the fake news circulating on the social media purported to have emanated from the commission and requesting CVs to fill non-existing vacancies. The Executive Chairman of FCC, Muheeba Dankaka, in a statement signed by her Special Adviser on media, Adamu Idris on Sunday stated that the call for submission of the CVs never emanated from the commission. She advised unsuspecting job seekers to disregard the report as it was the handiwork of fraudsters trying to use the name of the Commission and her good office to defraud innocent job seekers. “For the avoidance of doubt, the Federal Character Commission is not a recruiting agency and does not recruit on behalf of any Ministry, Department, or Agency. “We, therefore, wish to warn the general public to be wary of such scams which are intended to rob teaming applicants who are desperately looking for a job. Applicants/job seekers are always advised to look at paid advertisements in the National dailies for any possible job opportunities,” the statement read in part. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
