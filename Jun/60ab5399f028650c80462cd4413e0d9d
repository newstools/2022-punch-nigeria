Former President, Olusegun Obasanjo on Saturday, warned Nigerian youths against leaving governance of the country to bad leaders. Obasanjo declared that leaving the affairs of the country to “those who are messing it up” would not make them achieve their aim in life. He, however, charged them to roll up their sleeves and make necessary contributions towards addressing challenges of the nation. The former President spoke in Abeokuta, Ogun State capital, at an event tagged ‘OBJ @85 Free Keke Programme’, where 85 tricycles (Keke) were distributed to beneficiaries as part of the activities marking the former President’s 85th birthday. The tricycles were donated through the Youth Development Centre of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library with beneficiaries drawn from the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. In his remarks, Obasanjo told the youths  to hold their future in their hands with a firm belief that “today is their day”, as against the famous cliché – youths are the leaders of tomorrow He said despite many challenges confronting Nigeria, there were “opportunities galore” and asked the younger generation to take advantage of it.
