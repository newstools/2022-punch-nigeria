There was calm on Sunday in Farfaru and Kwari communities in the Jibia Local Government Area of Katsina State after gunmen ransacked the communities and abducted many women and children. PUNCH Metro learnt that residents in the two communities had relocated to the headquarters of the council in Jibia for protection. It was gathered that the hoodlums around 3pm on Saturday invaded Farfaru village, where they burnt down houses, rustled domestic animals and abducted indigenes. A resident revealed that the gunmen were on a reprisal. According to the resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the assailants were angry after security men arrested some of their colleagues a few days ago. “Only God knows the number of villagers the gunmen kidnapped. They also burnt down our houses and rustled our animals. “Security operatives who arrived at Farfaru later saved us. The security operatives drove them back to the forest. Many of us have relocated to Jibia for our own safety,” he added. It was learnt that another batch of gunmen stormed Kwari village around 9.30pm on Saturday when they shot many residents and rustled animals. No death was reported in the two attacks.
