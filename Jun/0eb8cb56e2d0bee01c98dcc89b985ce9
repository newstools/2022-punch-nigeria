A suspect, Kingsley Essien, narrates how his wife, Bright Essien, travelled to Mali for greener pastures only to find out that she had been trafficked for prostitution. Essien said his sister was the one who informed him about the ‘job opportunity’ in Mali. He also denied selling his son for N600, 000 but only asked a woman, one Chinyere Kalu, to lend him N600, 000 so as to enable him start up a business. Kalu is also the one helping him to cater for the child and has denied any claims of buying the child for N600,000. Essien’s wife counters his claims in this video. Copyright PUNCH.
