A mob on Saturday killed a member of a vigilance group for reportedly making a blasphemous statement. It was gathered that members of the vigilance group guarding the Timber shed market at the Federal Housing Estate in Abuja had wanted to arrest some residents wandering around the market in the early hours of Saturday. The residents were said to have begged the vigilance group to free them in the name of Allah but one of the vigilantes kicked and made comments said to be blasphemous. A trader in the market who spoke to our correspondent in confidence said the vigilante was beaten and stoned before he was set ablaze. Details later… Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
