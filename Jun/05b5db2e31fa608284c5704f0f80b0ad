A contestant in the primary election of the Peoples Democratic Party for the Ifako-Ijaiye Federal Constituency, Lagos State, Shodipo Iyabo, has cried out to the National Chairman of the party, Iyorchia Ayu, over irregularities during the election and the subsequent re-run. In a letter addressed to the National Chairman, Iyabo said she won the primary election held on May 24, 2022, as declared by the returning office and the electoral officer. However, to her surprise, Iyabo lamented that the National Working Committee of the PDP announced a re-run election for the constituency. She said during the re-run election on June 6, the list of the 33 ad hoc delegates presented by the electoral officer to the audience, was skewed in favour of only one aspirant, Fateema Ogunkola. The letter reads in part, “The list contains names of delegates who are not members of any ward in the PDP. Rather, they are card-carrying members of the APC. Kindly verify the list of these 33 ad hoc delegates with each ward executive member and confirm this allegation to be the truth and nothing but the truth.” She alleged that Ogunkola went behind the scene to conduct a kangaroo primary without notifying the two other aspirants. When asked by our correspondent if the national chairman had responded to her letter, she said, “he has not.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
