The Federal Government has declared Monday, June 13, 2022, a public holiday to mark this year’s Democracy Day. The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, who made the declaration on behalf of the Federal Government, urged all citizens to support the present regime in its efforts at ensuring a secured, united and prosperous nation. In a statement by the Ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Dr Shuaib Belgore, the minister reminded Nigerians of the challenges the nation had faced and overcome. He urged Nigerians to refrain from agitations that could disintegrate the country. The statement read in part, “As we mark another Democracy Day in the history of our dear country, let us reflect on the efforts of our founding fathers and ensure that Nigeria remains one united, secured, peaceful and an indivisible entity, noting that no development can take place in an acrimonious environment. “With the challenges we face in Nigeria today, I see an opportunity for us not to break up or break down, but to break open; open up to ourselves in truth so that we may appreciate each other, understand each other, honour each other and live together in peace and prosperity.” The minister also advised Nigerians to judiciously put to use the recently unveiled Nigeria Internal Security and Public Safety Alert System Mobile App designed to mitigate security challenges and other disasters in the country.
