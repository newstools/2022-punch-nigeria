A human rights activist and Delta State governorship candidate of the Young Progressive Party, Sonny Ofehe, has said that his emergence will give the All Progressives Congress and People Democratic Party aspirants, Ovie Omo-Agege and Sheriff Oborevwori respectively, sleepless nights. Ofehe, who stated this on Saturday shortly after his emergence as the governorship candidate of the party for the 2023 general election in Asaba, said he is looking forward to a debate with the PDP and APC candidates. The 49-old-year activist emerged through option A4 primary as the only aspirant for the governorship position of the party. The returning officer of the electoral panel of the party, Tosan Blessing, declared Ofehe winner in the primary. “Having certified the electoral guideline for this process of option A4 voting, I hereby declare Sunny Ofehe as the YPP candidate for the 2023 governorship election,” he said. However, Ofehe in his acceptance speech, called on electorates to reject those leaders who think that their votes do not matter. He said Delta is so rich in mineral resources and potentials that we cannot continue to sit idle and allow our common patrimony to be looted and left Delta undeveloped. He said, “Today, I am offering myself to serve the good people of Delta State. 2023, we must reject those that want only to protect their interest, thereby deceiving the people crumbs while flattering away what belongs to all of us. “We must reject those leaders who think your votes do not matter. I am in this race as a voice of the voiceless, a pathfinder for deprived, the less privilege” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
