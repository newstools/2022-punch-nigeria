The Federal Government has said another 166 Nigerians trafficked to Libya would be repatriated to the country. The evacuees departed Mitiga International Airport, Tripoli and were expected to arrive in Nigeria through the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos. The Charge d’ Affairs of the Nigerian Mission in Libya , Kabiru Musa, said this in a statement made available to journalists on Wednesday in Abuja. He said that the voluntary evacuation was carried out by the Federal Government in collaboration with the International Organisation for Migration and the support of the Libyan authorities. Musa said, “Today again, we have successfully evacuated another batch of stranded Nigerians in Libya, who will be reuniting with their families any moment from now by God’s grace. “The 166 Nigerian returnees departed Mitiga International Airport aboard a chartered BURAQ Air Flight UZ189MJI and expected to arrive at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos. “This continuous evacuation is in line with the commitments of the Nigerian government of not allowing any of its citizens to remain stranded abroad. “Libya is a transit country for those trying to cross over to other parts of the world through irregular routes, that is why we have so many stranded Nigerians here.” Musa said that the Federal Government, through the Mission, was ready and committed to return any of its citizens who wanted to voluntarily return home. No fewer than 774 stranded Nigerians have been repatriated between August, 2021 and June 1, 2022. On August 25, 2021, 107 were repatriated, 180 on December 8, 2021, and 159 on February 23, 2022. On March 15, 2022, 162 were evacuated while 166 Nigerians are expected in the country. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
