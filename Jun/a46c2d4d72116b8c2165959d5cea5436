Nigerian rapper, songwriter, and actor Folarin Falana, popularly known as Falz the Bahd Guy, has released his fifth studio album titled BAHD, in the wee hours of Thursday. The new album, released under his self-owned record label, Bahd Guys Entertainment, comprises 12 tracks and features Nigerian stars like Tiwa Savage, The Cavemen, BNXN, LAX, Chike, and new Mavin Records signee BoySpyce. BAHD comes three years after Falz’s last studio album, Moral Instruction, in which the 31-year-old heavily sampled the late Afrobeat icon, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, and dealt extensively with socio-political themes including government corruption, religious hypocrisy and terrorism, and failing moral standards on the part of Nigerians. His new album departs from that political tone, settling instead for the comic and light-hearted themes for which the rapper first came to be known. Falz has since grown a reputation as a musician with a political streak since he, alongside colleague Runtown, led the first round of protests in Lagos State during the EndSARS campaign of October 2020. Last Saturday, the rapper announced that he will be hosting a music concert on June 11 at the Tafawa Balewa Square, adding that only those with Permanent Voter Cards or temporary voter slips will be allowed entry.
