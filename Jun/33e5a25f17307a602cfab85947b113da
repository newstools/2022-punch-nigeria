Former President Goodluck Jonathan was on Thursday at the headquarters of the Federal Road Safety Corps in Abuja to renew his driving licence. In a statement by the Corps Public Education Officer, Bisi Kazeem, the former President was impressed with the services offered at the driver’s licence capture centre. “I am impressed with what I have seen and I am happy that this agency is functioning optimally, very focused and highly effective. I am always proud of the deployment of technology and I believe the Corps has a key role to play in arresting the security situation in the country,” Jonathan was quoted as saying. He further added that he personally came for the capture because there are no more shortcuts in the processes for the acquisition of the National Driver’s Licence, and it cannot be done by proxy anymore due to the effective deployment of technology in the entire process. Jonathan was taken on a tour of the facilities by the FRSC by Corps Marshall and Chief Executive, Boboye Oyeyemi, where he examined some of the equipment used by the Corps. Some of the facilities Jonathan visited included the Emergency Call Centre, the Monitoring and Control Room, and other vital national infrastructure domiciled at the headquarters of the Corps. He was accompanied by former FRSC boss and former Minister of Aviation, Osita Chidoka. See photos:   Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
