Suspected gunmen have reportedly killed two policemen in Mkpanpu village, Enugu Ezike in the Igbo-Eze North Local Government Area of Enugu State. City Round gathered that the two cops were killed on Thursday at the mechanic workshop of a private transport company located near the LG headquarters. A community source told our correspondent on Friday that there was tension in the community, adding that youths had deserted the town for fear of arrest by the police. The source said, “The hoodlums stormed the place around 11 am, shot the cops and collected their guns. Initially, people thought the incident happened at the loading park of the transport firm but local security operatives that visited the scene of the incident told us that it happened at the workshop located at Mkpanpu village and that the victims were an inspector and a sergeant. I don’t know why the police authorities post policemen to a private workshop.’’ The state police spokesperson, Daniel Ndukwe, could not be reached for his comment as of the time of filing this report. His mobile was unreachable. Also, a text message sent had not been responded to at the time this report was filed. Contacted, the state Commissioner of Police, Abubakar Lawal, said, “Contact the PPRO please.” He redirected our correspondent to the police spokesperson when told that the PPRO’s mobile was unreachable.
