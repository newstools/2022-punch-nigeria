Former Super Eagles captain John Mikel Obi has expressed satisfaction over the success of the maiden Back2Base talent hunt programme held at the University of Lagos sports complex, Lagos. Mikel, who was present all through the three-day programme, said he was very impressed with the level of skills exhibited by the youngsters who participated in three sports, namely football, basketball and tennis. While the former Chelsea star promptly fulfilled the cash rewards to the outstanding athletes, he also promised to do his best to ensure they were given more platforms to actualise their dreams of becoming superstars in their chosen fields. He said, “I’m very happy with the success of this first edition, for me all the children are winners because they are all talented one way or the other and they have shown they all have a bright future ahead of them.’’
