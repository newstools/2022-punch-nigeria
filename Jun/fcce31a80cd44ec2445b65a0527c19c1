Former Super Eagles captain, Mikel Obi, says the Back2Base talent hunt, which holds from June 9 to 11 at the University of Lagos Sports Centre, Yaba will not be for footballers alone, The PUNCH reports. Mikel, who made this known during the unveiling of the three-day event at a press conference in Lagos, added that emerging basketball players and tennis stars would get opportunities to showcase their talents as well. “It’s an opportunity for us to give back to the community; first of all, we have to realise that there is so much talents in this country waiting to be discovered,” the 35-year-old said. “So, with the Back2Base project, we are hoping to help showcase these talents. “The first edition is starting in Lagos, but we hope we can take it around the country subsequently. It’s going to be an exciting time for the children, not just in football but also in basketball and tennis.” Mikel noted that as a Youth Ambassador, it was his duty to help the young ones with opportunities that would bring smiles not just on their faces but also to their parents. “This means a lot to me because I remember growing up as a child in Jos, I was only lucky to be discovered. “Our target is not just to ship the talents we discover abroad but to even see how they can be of good use even from the domestic scene.” Our correspondent learnt that while the talent hunt programme would be for three days, the fourth day is reserved for an exclusive dinner with Mikel, alongside the athletes that would be discovered during the exercise.
