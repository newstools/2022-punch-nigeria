Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, and former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, on Friday, recommended strategies that could help Nigeria’s Super Eagles defeat the Black Stars of Ghana during their second-leg World Cup Qualifier in Abuja next week Tuesday. Nigeria had to settle for a 0-0 draw in Ghana on Friday after VAR overruled a decision to award the visitors a penalty in the first leg of a World Cup play-off. A review of the decision in the closing stages of the West African showdown in Kumasi showed that Ghana midfielder Iddrisu Baba was fouled before the handball. However, while reacting to the goalless draw after 90 minutes on Friday, Atiku urged the Nigerian national team to remain focused and united during the second leg. In a tweet on his official Twitter handle, Atiku said working as one, the team can surmount any challenges irrespective of their opponent. He wrote, “Well done, Super Eagles. You have a second chance on Tuesday to make Nigeria’s participation in Qatar 2022 a reality. As one, we can surmount any challenges.” On his part, Saraki, also a former governor of Kwara State, commended the Super Eagles for their performance in Kumasi, while advising the team to exploit the “home advantage” in defeating the Black Stars on Tuesday in Abuja. He wrote, “Strong performance by our @NGSuperEagles! Let’s wrap this up nicely on Tuesday when we have home advantage!”. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
