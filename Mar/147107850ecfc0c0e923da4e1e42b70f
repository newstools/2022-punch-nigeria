The Director-General of the Industrial Training Fund, Joseph Ari, has denied plans to contest any elective position in the 2023 general elections. Ari, who addressed a press conference in Jos on Saturday, said his campaign posters which had flooded many parts of the state were the handiwork of mischief makers trying to distract the ITF under his leadership from fulfilling its mandate of developing the nation’s human resource, especially concerning poverty reduction, job and wealth creation. “I have also been reliably informed that these disgruntled elements plot to flood the convention venue with these posters to breed mistrust and disharmony and thereby generate rancor for their own selfish purposes as I have never contemplated and not contemplating vying for any elective position in the nearest future, as I am presently busy and fully engaged with the onerous responsibility of deploying the mandate of the ITF to equip Nigerians with skills for employability and entrepreneurship. “To this end, the public is, therefore, advised to disregard any campaign poster to the effect that I, Sir Joseph N. Ari, is running for any elective position, or in support of the ambition of any candidate during the upcoming APC convention as it is false, unfounded and not deserving of any attention,” the ITF DG stated. The Director-General said he had reported the matter to the security agencies for further necessary action. Ari also advised the mischief makers to desist from acts aimed at pulling down people who are working to better society. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
