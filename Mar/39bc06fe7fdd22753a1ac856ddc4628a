Yes, there is money to be made in Cryptocurrency. In fact, there are millions to be made in the metaverse. Investing this March could be the start of your first-class journey to sky-rocketing profits. We’re switching on our propulsion engine, get on board for the ride of a lifetime. Seesaw Protocol (SSW) overnight managed to reach the outstanding price-per-token of 0.15 USD. That comes after the protocol announced that it will be live on exchange platforms on April 8th – that’s less than two weeks from now. As Seesaw Protocol is in its presale stage, and it won’t be too long before it’ll start its trading journey, the time to get in is now. The reason is that there is so much more to gain in presale. Presale refers to the period of time that precedes the official launch of a cryptocurrency’s trading market. A presale enables holders and new investors to place their money into brand new cryptocurrency ventures for a lower and more beneficial price, increasing chances of making large, substantial returns on initial investments. Seesaw Protocol is up +2333% since last January with a forecast that shows it could reach a further growth of 7000% SSW is currently sold at $0.15 (from starting price of $0.005) but predictions clearly show that it’s not stopping here. Analysts’ graphs show that the price is likely to increase in the next month and reach anywhere between $0.35 and $0.40 – getting in before that happens could make anyone millions in returns. Dogecoin (DOGE) is Up 10% together with Shiba Inu (SHIB) – Battling for First place in Doggy-Coin-verse Remember Seesaw Protocol’s price predictions? This is why missing out shouldn’t be an option. Shiba Inu (SHIB) made millionaires with a single investment of just $2 (less than your morning coffee!). In January 2021 with those two dollars, millions were made in return as the meme coin grew from $0.00000000011 to the record high of $0.000088 – a whopping 70% increase. With the meme coin culture rapidly growing, and the almost 300 meme coins currently in circulation (according to coinmarketcap.com) there are definitely big profits to be made in the crypto-verse – starting of course, with the two meme-kings Shiba and Doge (who amongst their supporters have celebs like Elon Musk, Kevin Jonas and Snoop Dogg) Although very different now, SHIB and DOGE share the same dog breed logo (cute Shiba Inu doggy) and were both created as a joke, a sort of rebellion against Bitcoin (BTC). Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently up 10.80% in 7d of trade, with the price of $0.000023 per token. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up, like its counterpart, 10.70% in 7d of trade and with a live price of $0.12 In the dog vs dog face-off, who are you betting on?
