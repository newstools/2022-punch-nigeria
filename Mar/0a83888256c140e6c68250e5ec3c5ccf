Ghana’s Black Stars have been dealt a huge blow ahead of their Qatar 2022 World Cup play-off against Nigeria after midfielder Edmund Addo was released from the squad due to injury. The Black Stars are billed to host the Super Eagles in the first leg on Friday (today) at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi while the second leg will be played at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium in Abuja on Tuesday. The FC Sheriff midfielder reportedly picked up the injury in his side’s league game against Sfintul Gheorghe on Saturday although he was in action for 84 minutes before he was replaced. Addo reported to the Black Stars camp but an MRI scan confirmed that the player will not be fit to feature in both legs against Nigeria. He was at the Korle-Bu Teaching hospital in Accra to see a specialist and is billed to return to Moldova for further treatment. This would serve as a huge blow for Ghana head coach, Otto Addo, who will now be left with just five other midfielders. “Midfielder Edmund Addo ruled out of Nigeria games. Player will leave camp for Moldova after an MRI result shows he can’t play in both games against Nigeria. The midfielder picked up an injury in Sheriff’s game against Gheorghe last Saturday,” Ghana journalist Saddick Adams tweeted. The hard tackling midfielder has made 29 appearances for Sheriff, who shocked Real Madrid 2-1 win at the Santiago Bernabéu in this season’s Champions League group stage. Copyright PUNCH.
