THE Nigerian Export Promotion Council has said that the country exported non-oil products worth $3.455bn in the 2021 fiscal year. The Executive Director, NEPC, Mr Ezra Yakusak, who said this while speaking at a seminar organised by the council in Owerri, the Imo State capital, on Tuesday, added that it was an increase from $2.21bn generated in 2020. Yakusak, who was represented by NEPC’s Trade Promotion Advisor in Imo State, Mr Anthony Ajuruchi, said that the council was able to achieve this as a result of the implementation of its current mantra, ‘Export for Survival’. He urged media practitioners to prioritise the exportation of non-oil products as a means of marketing Nigeria’s indigenous products at the international level and diversifying its economy for survival. He commended exporters in Imo for manufacturing products worth over $2.3m from 2016 to 2021 and exporting same to countries such as Poland, USA, Dubai, Italy and Australia. While thanking the state governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, for providing the enabling business environment for NEPC’s activities, he called for more support from his government. He added that the Federal Government had assisted companies with necessary certification to penetrate the global market. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
