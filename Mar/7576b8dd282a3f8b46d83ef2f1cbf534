Ahead of the 2023 general elections, former Governor of Delta State and chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, Chief James Ibori, has declared that those plotting to undermine his influence in the politics of the state by conspiring to disgrace him “shall suffer shame.” He made the assertion on Saturday at Mosogar, Ethiope West Local Government Area of the state during the declaration of the national chairman of Delta Central 2023, Senator Ighoyota Amori, to contest for the Delta Central Senatorial seat. Ibori, while endorsing Amori as his preferred candidate in the PDP, noted that as a stakeholder in the party and in the Urhobo nation, he should have a say on who becomes what in his senatorial district. He warned that those planning to undermine him, in an attempt to disgrace him at the poll “will be disgraced by God.” Ibori, therefore, urged party leaders and stakeholders to support Amori’s senatorial ambition, noting that support for Amori is a support for him. He said, “I am behind him and I will support Senator Ighoyota Amori every step on the way.  And anybody, anyone conspiring, anybody that thinks that because I am now a former governor they want to conspire to disgrace me, God will disgrace all of them. “This is my senatorial district, I am a stakeholder in this party and I am a stakeholder in Urhoboland, this is my place of birth, I am with Senator Amori all the way. “I want to assure that if you give Senator Amori your support, he will not disappoint you, I want to guarantee you that Senator Amori will perform beyond expectation because we know his capacity, we know his reach, he has contact and knows how to use it and that seat befits Amori, so let us support him.”  Copyright PUNCH.
