One of Victor Osimhen’s agents, Roberto Calenda, believes the Nigerian is gradually silencing his critics following his recent display for Napoli. The 23-year-old was criticised following Napoli’s 1-0 loss against Milan last week, with some pundits questioning his striking skills. But last Sunday, Osimhen scored a brace in the Partenopei’s 2-1 win over Hellas Verona to take his tally to 13 in 24 appearances this term. “Sometimes people talk without thinking and Victor is proving what kind of striker he is,” Calenda told Radio Marte. “To me, he has ample room for improvement. I hope he will keep it going and that his injuries are over. “You can see his commitment in every game. “He plays for the team and Napoli’s win against Verona was super, not many teams have achieved the same. “Napoli have been tormented by injuries this season, the coach always had to make something up.” The Partenopei sit second in the Serie A table, three points off leaders Milan. Osimhen has scored 13 goals in 24 appearances this term.
