A former candidate in the 2019 Imo State governorship election, Uche Nwosu and other members of the Imo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress loyal to ex-governor Rochas Okorocha, have been appointed into the party’s national convention sub-committees. In the list obtained by Journalists in Abuja on Saturday and signed by James Akpanudoedehe,
Secretary Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Nwosu, made the list as a member of the screening committee. Okorocha’s other loyalists appointed into the committee were Sunny Chiadi, Ijeoma Igboamusi, Okey Anyikwa, Nnanna Okoro, Faisal Lawal, Steve Asimobi, among others. The former governor is currently a presidential aspirant on the platform of the APC. The Imo State chapter of the APC has been polarized between factions loyal to the State governor, Hope Uzodinma and Okorocha, who is also the Senator representing Imo West. The Supreme Court has fixed judgement in a suit to determine the authenticity of Daniel Nwafor’s chairmanship. Nwafor is the Chairman recognized by Okorocha’s faction of the party. Governor Hope Uzodinma and Dave Umahi of Imo and Ebonyi states also made it as Chairmen of Screening Appeal and Venue/Decoration Committees, respectively. Also in the APC Sub-Committee are Senator Andy Uba, former Chief of Army Staff, General Azubuike Ihejirika, former Deputy Inspector General of Police, Shuaibu Gambo, Audie Mohammed, among others.
