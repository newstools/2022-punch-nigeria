The Katsina State Police Command on Monday paraded 16 suspects, including two alleged kidnappers. The two suspected kidnappers, Usman Abubakar, 22, and Yusufa Ibrahim, 30, were arrested on February 9, 2022, after they made phone calls to one Abdulbasiru Salisu of Shema village, in the Dutsinma Local Government Area of the state. The suspects reportedly threatened Salisu to deposit N250,000 into a bank account number or risk being kidnapped. The state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Gambo Isah, who spoke to journalists at the command headquarters where the suspects were paraded, revealed that the duo were later traced and arrested. Isah added, “They confessed to the crime and other similar offences.  Investigation is ongoing,” Six other suspects alleged to have been caught with items suspected to be weed were also among those paraded. Other suspects paraded were four members of a syndicate of burglars, alleged to be terrorising Katsina and its environs and three others described as brigands. Isah said all the suspects would be arraigned at the completion of investigation. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
