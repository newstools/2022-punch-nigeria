The All Progressives Congress in Anambra State has called for the timely investigation and trial of the former governor of the state, Willie Obiano. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission had arrested Obiano at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, on Thursday, shortly after he handed over. The party’s position was contained in a statement on Sunday by its state Publicity Secretary, Okelo Madukaife. The statement read in part, “Following the shocking interception, arrest and subsequent detention of Obiano while travelling to United States of America on the same day he handed over power, we urge the EFCC not to detain him for longer than necessary. “We had expressed shock, because, although Obiano spent nearly half of his tenure in his private home in this offshore location, he had prior knowledge that there were issues to clear with EFCC, having had a prior information on the matter for months. “Considered alongside the fact that neither the former governor nor his successor, has said anything about what is being handed over and what has been taken over financially, we are keeping an open mind on events of the last few days. “However, since the financial crime agency set off the alarm late last year, it means there has been enough time to put facts, figures and the law together. “We therefore, without any interference with the statutory duties of the commission, appeal to EFCC to conduct a timely investigation on the questioned areas of financial dealings, recover monies for Anambra State, where applicable and/or prosecute offenders where they exist, without any delay, which may fuel speculation and detract from concrete issues of Anambra State financial leakages.”  Copyright PUNCH.
