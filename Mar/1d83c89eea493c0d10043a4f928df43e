The Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, is set to inaugurate a committee to renegotiate the 2009 agreement between the Federal Government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities tomorrow (Monday). The committee is expected to turn in its report in six weeks from the time of inauguration. Sunday PUNCH reports that the 2009 agreement has become a bone of contention between the two parties. ASUU had on several occasions accused the Federal Government of failing to implement some of the agreements reached. In 2009, the government agreed with ASUU that the condition of service of university lecturers would be reviewed every five years. The condition of service includes the issue of salaries and allowances of the lecturers. But the education minister has constituted a seven-man committee to look into the agreement. The committee will be inaugurated on Monday, according to the spokesman for the ministry, Ben Goong. “The Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, will inaugurate a team to renegotiate the agreement the Federal Government reached with the Academic Staff Union of Universities in 2009,” Goong stated. The spokesman for the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Charles Akpan, explained that the committee would be expected to turn in its report in six weeks. “The committee on renegotiation set up by the Ministry of Education is expected to round off everything on the condition of service and turn in its report in six weeks,” Akpan said.
