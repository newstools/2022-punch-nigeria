THE Federal Capital Territory Administration has commenced the demolition of structures built on the land allocated to the FCT Police Command. The land, which is located at Utako area of the FCT, had been taken over by unauthorised people. The administration claimed it served the illegal occupants of the land eviction notices before the exercise. Speaking during the exercise, the Senior Special Assistant to the FCT Minister on Monitoring, Inspection and Enforcement, Ikharo Attah, said the operation was meant to help the FCT Police reclaim its land. Attah also doused the tension generated over speculation that houses of the indigenous people within the area were targeted. He said only illegal structures on the land were marked for demolition. Attah said, “We are only removing the illegal structures to reclaim the land for the original allottee, the FCT Police Command. We are not demolishing the houses of indigenous people. “The cleanup will also help to address the disturbing traffic gridlock and also criminal activities of miscreants in the place.” Also, the Director, Department of Development Control, Muktar Galadima explained that the demolition was not just a routine exercise but a special operation to remove all illegal structures and pave way for the original allottees to regain their land.
