The Rivers State Police Command said its operatives arrested four persons allegedly involved in the kidnap and murder of a driver, Onyekachi Chukwuagu, along the East-West Road in the Emohua Local Government Area of the state. The acting spokesperson for the command, Grace Iringe-Koko, disclosed this in a statement on Saturday in Port Harcourt. Iringe-Koko said the suspects, who posed as passengers, boarded the victim’s car and attacked him during the trip. The statement read, “The suspects – Obichi Ngita, 20; Chisom Honest, 20; Young Chitu, 21; and Omens Woke, 23 – on Tuesday, March 22, 2022, while pretending to be regular passengers, boarded the victim’s vehicle. “However, when they got to a quiet part of the route, they kidnapped the victim and abandoned the vehicle, with number plate GDD 250 MU, by the roadside. “The command, upon receipt of the complaint, swiftly mobilised operatives to the scene, where they cordoned off the area and commenced an intensive search resulting in the arrest of Chisom Honest. “Honest then led operatives to the rest of the gang and the location of the victim’s corpse. The suspects claimed they murdered the victim, using a machete, for refusing to cooperate with them.” The acting police spokesperson said efforts had been intensified to apprehend other suspects fingered in the incident. She noted that the state Commissioner of Police, Friday Eboka, while condoling with the family of the deceased, assured that the suspects would be arraigned on completion of investigation.
