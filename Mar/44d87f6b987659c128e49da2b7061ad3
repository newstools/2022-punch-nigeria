Dr Justin Dean, the husband of Nigerian dancer, Korra Obidi, has stated that divorcing his wife would be the hardest decision of his life. The chiropractor, who has been vocal about his divorce for over a week now, also announced that he was filling out the paperwork this week. In an Instagram post on Tuesday, the father-of-two noted that he was leaving the marriage because of his mental health. He wrote, “I’m heartbroken! Anyone that knows me or watches me online knows that I’m a dedicated family man to both Korra and my children. “This is honestly the hardest decision of my life, but necessary. “I’m walking away from this marriage for my mental health and to be the best version of myself. I must set a healthy example for my children. “This has nothing to do with postpartum depression. I’ve been betrayed once again and she is unbothered, which pretty much summarizes our marriage. “My apology to all the young men and women that believed we had a ‘perfect marriage’. “Marriage is based on mutual love, respect, humility, accountability, empathy, apologies and most of all effective communication to understand the other person’s perspectives. “Likes and views shouldn’t be the highlight of your relationship. Men, your mental health matters! “In order to be strong, you have to be happy.” Revealing his divorce plans, Dean said, “I’m filling paperwork this week. I will always be there for my children,and wish her the best.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
