Nigerian women have expressed their disappointment over the rejection of gender bills in the National Assembly. During the plenary session on Tuesday, a bill seeking to give at least ten slots to women as ministers and commissioners in the federal and state governments failed at the upper legislative chamber. In a statement obtained by The PUNCH on Thursday, the aggrieved women, under the aegis of Women of Nigeria asked the National Assembly to reconsider their decision. The statement titled ‘Women’s Statement On The Rejection Of Gender Bills By NASS’, noted that the National Assembly has taken the women backwards. It partly read, “The men of the 9th NASS by their actions have taken us backwards. “Their actions undermine the importance and relevance of women’s contribution to the governance of Nigeria including the key role women play to bring victory to political parties in elections at all levels across the country. They also voted against diaspora voting! Nigerian women, therefore, demand that all gender Bills be reconsidered. “Ultimately, our demands will benefit not just women but Nigeria as a whole. More women in governance will only bring progress, and respect for Nigeria in the committee of nations. “We cannot, in 2022, be negotiating the rights of women and the sanctity of the dignity of girls. We call on the National Assembly to re-present these Bills as a matter of urgency and ensure that they are passed.” Some women had on Wednesday stormed the gate of the National Assembly in Abuja to express their grievances concerning the rejected bills.
