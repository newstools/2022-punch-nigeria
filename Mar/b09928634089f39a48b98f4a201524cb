Turkish billionaire Muhsin Bayrak says he is trying to buy Chelsea and although his spokesperson has told us he has made a bid, his claims are being viewed with some scepticism. Also, Conor McGregor entered the bidding war for Chelsea with an offer of £1.5billion as other global billionaires consider a purchase. The Blues’ Russian owner Roman Abramovich dramatically announced earlier this week he was looking to sell the club due to growing economic sanctions in the UK and amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Bayrak is quoted in Turkish newspaper Yeni Safak as saying: “We are discussing the terms of Chelsea’s purchase with Roman Abramovich’s lawyers. We are in the negotiation phase. We will fly the Turkish flag in London soon.” A spokesperson for Bayrak has told us: “First of all yes the news is true. We submitted our offer.” Bayrak is chairman of construction and investment company AB Group Holding. The Swiss-American consortium includes Todd Boehly and Hansjorg Wyss. Boehly part owns the LA Dodgers and LA Lakers. He is chairman and chief executive of investment company Eldridge Industries. Wyss is founder and former president of medical manufacturer Synthes Holding AG. Boehly tried to buy Chelsea from Abramovich for £2 billion in 2019. He has made no secret of his desire to buy a top Premier League club.
