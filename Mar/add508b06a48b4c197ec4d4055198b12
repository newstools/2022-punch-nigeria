FC Midtjylland’s Nigerian midfielder, Raphael Onyedika, is on the radar of French club AS Monaco and Dutch Eredivisie club PSV, PUNCH Sports Extra has learnt. Oyedika, who signed a new deal until 2026 with Danish outfit Midtjylland last November, could be on the move this summer after both clubs opened talks with his representatives, it was also learnt. The 20-year-old replaced another Nigerian Frank Onyeka at FC Midtjylland after the latter’s move to EPL side Brentford last summer. “Raphael has a deal that runs until 2026 but there are some clubs from Holland and France that have shown interest in him ahead of the next transfer window,” one of his intermediaries, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. “It all depends on if the clubs can meet his valuation.” Onyedika, 20, has been in excellent form, scoring four goals and registering one assist in 35 appearances across all competitions this season.
