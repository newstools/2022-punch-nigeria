The Orita Challenge area of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, was on Thursday, thrown into confusion after a car driven by a member of the National Youth Service Corps was reportedly shot at by a policeman. Our correspondent gathered that the policeman shot at the car the corps member was driving but it was not clear if anybody was injured in the incident or not. The identity of the corps members who were in the car could not be ascertained at the time of filing this report but the shooting reportedly happened on Thursday afternoon. The corps members were said to be coming from the Community Development Service meeting when the trigger-happy cop opened fire on their car. A picture allegedly from the scene shows a hole obviously created by a bullet at the back windscreen of a car and the cap of a corps member is also in the car while some people gathered around the car to peep inside it A trader at the area told our correspondent that the shooting caused panic in the area as some youths protested but the policeman and his colleagues fled immediately after he fired the shot. Although the Police Public Relations Officer for Oyo State Police Command, Adewale Osifeso, refused to answer calls by our correspondent, the South-West Coordinator of the National Association of Nigeria Students, Olatunji Adegboye, confirmed to our correspondent that a vehicle driven by a corps member was shot at. He said, “I heard that a corps member was shot by the police at Challenge area. Some of our guys are there but I have not got his identity and the detail of what happened. “The shooting of the Adeseun Ogundoyin Polytechnic student ought to have taught the policemen a lesson but this happened again now.”
