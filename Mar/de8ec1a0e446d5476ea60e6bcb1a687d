Global 500 report issued by Brand Finance, a leading brand strategy consultancy, has ranked Allianz the 30th in the list of the world’s most valuable brands. A statement said, “Among the world’s 100 most valuable insurance brands, Allianz ranked first among internationally operating insurers. This was announced by Brand Finance. “The rating confirms Allianz’s position as one of the world’s strongest brands. Among the main reasons for the upgrade is the improved revenue outlook after the coronavirus-induced uncertainty, and an increase in Allianz’s brand strength score.” With Allianz’s Asset Management business, and €2.5T AuM, it said the overall brand value increased by 12 per cent and reached almost €39bn. The Group Strategy, Marketing, Distribution Officer at Allianz SE, Serge Raffard, said, “This news affirms not only the brand strength of Allianz but also demonstrates that Allianz is more than a leader in the insurance business.” With a top brand strength rating in the AAA band, the statement said Allianz would use its brand as a key facilitator for moving the business into new and adjacent categories. The Head of Global Brand & Marketing at Allianz SE, Dr. Christian Deuringer, was quoted as saying, “It makes me very proud to share such fantastic news at the beginning of 2022. Being rated 30th among the strongest global brands reflects the hard work and strategy behind the steadily growing Allianz brand.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
