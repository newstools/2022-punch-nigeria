The Taraba State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party on Wednesday assured that the party would allow a level-playing field for all aspirants during the primary. The state Chairman of the party, Col Agbu Kefas (retd.), gave the assurances during the party’s stakeholders meeting in Jalingo. Kefas explained that the party’s transformational agenda in the state was already yielding results and efforts were on to accommodate the people’s choice for leadership selection. According to him, “the desire for credible leaders and the transformation of Taraba would fail if the people are overruled and imposed with candidates during the process. “So, there is not going to be an anointed candidate. Everybody is free to contest and win the election. One thing we are going to ensure is the credibility of the candidates and that is why we have inaugurated a committee to assess the aspirants’ credibility. “Our desire is not just to win but also ensure the desired quality leadership delivery for the state. “We have no cracks in PDP, we have been winning and we are set again to win again come 2023.” Earlier, Governor Darius Ishaku, who was represented by his Deputy, Haruna Manu appealed for the party’s commitment to ensure victory over the opposition. “Do not allow the opposition to take over the state. Taraba has been PDP since 1999, and is required of you to ensure that PDP wins all the positions and maintain its rule in the state,” he appealed. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
