A lecturer and another person have been released by bandits after spending 106 with their abductors. The men whose names were given as Musa Dikko and Ezekiel Bello, a lecturer of Niger State Polytechnic, Zungeru, were said to have been on their way to Kaduna for an event in December last year when they were abducted. A family source told our correspondent that the families of the abductees paid large sums of money to secure their release from captivity. “They both have been in the custody of the Kidnappers for 106 days until their release yesterday despite collecting huge sums of money. We thank God that they are finally back and may the Almighty Allah continue to protect us all,” the source said. It was also gathered that the abductors requested money for more than three three times without releasing the victims. The victims who were said to leave been released in Kaduna on Monday are receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
