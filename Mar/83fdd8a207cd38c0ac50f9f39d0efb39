A housewife and mother of five, Aisha Tijani, has been arrested by men of the Ogun State Police Command for allegedly setting her 10-year-old daughter ablaze. The suspect was arrested following a report lodged at the Mowe divisional headquarters. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, in a statement on Tuesday, said the police were informed by the suspect’s neighbour that she poured petrol on her little daughter and set her ablaze. He said the neighbour reported that the woman got annoyed because the girl took a phone she (Tijani) seized from one of her children from where she kept it and returned it to the child. Oyeyemi said, “Upon the report, the DPO, Mowe division, CSP Folashade Tanaruno, quickly moved to the scene with detectives and got the suspect arrested. “The victim, who had been badly burnt, was rushed to the nearest hospital from where she was referred to the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital for proper medical attention. “On interrogation, the suspect, who claimed to have been separated from the father of the children, explained to the police that she did not know what came over her when she was carrying out the wicked act.” The PPRO said the state Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, had ordered the transfer of the suspect to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for further investigation.
