Aloy Ejimakor, counsel for the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, says it has become necessary for the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), to revisit the 15 counts against his client. In an open letter to Malami, the lawyer noted that the office of the AGF issued a legal opinion/advice exonerating DCP Abba Kyari from the allegation of money laundering, which formed the basis upon which the United States of America is seeking his extradition. Ejimakor stated, “In as much as this legal advice does not sit well with certain segments of Nigerians (and even the Americans that seek the extradition of Abba Kyari), it needs to be stated that the rendering of legal opinion or advice conforms with the constitutional powers of the attorney-general of the federation as preserved under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “This very legal advice exonerating Abba Kyari has created a new legal connection between Abba Kyari and Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. The connection lies simply in the fact that if Abba Kyari is deemed entitled to such legal advice that will surely impact his extradition, Nnamdi Kanu is equally entitled to any legal advice that impacts his prosecution.” Such legal advice, he said, must include the doctrine of speciality, which pertains to extraditions, adding, “An extradited fugitive (whether renditioned or otherwise) is subject to prosecution only for those offences for which he or she was surrendered, extradited or renditioned. “Failure to do so will amount to a clear violation of the doctrine of speciality as enshrined in Nigeria’s Extradition Act and equal protection of the law as preserved in the Nigerian constitution.” Copyright PUNCH.
