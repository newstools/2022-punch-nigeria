Chairman of Afikpo South Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, Eni Uduma-Chima, has disagreed with the ruling of the Federal High Court Abuja, which sacked David Umahi, and his Deputy ,Kelechi Igwe, from office for defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party  to the All Progressives Congress. Eni, a former member of Ebonyi State House of Assembly, while reacting to the ruling in Abakaliki, on Friday, expressed optimism that the appellate courts would find the faults in the judgement and uphold the judgement of Abakaliki High which had earlier ruled that Umahi and his deputy offended no law for defecting to the APC. He said, “The judgment of the Federal High Court apart from being unjust is equally unpopular and is the only court judgment that has attracted the widest condemnations and public review since Nigerian independence. “The judgment which is capable of causing constitutional crisis is devoid of any form of justice and portrays aberration of the principle of stare decisis apart from the fact  that the suit itself is a gross abuse of the revered process of the Court. “The  Appellate Courts with erudite and versatile gentlemen sitting on their benches will soon be siezed with the opportunity of doing justice to the case, and as we all know the Court is not just the last hope of the common man, but the last hope of the uncommon Governor of Ebonyi State.”  Copyright PUNCH.
