Despite being in the custody of the Department of State Services, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, on Monday expressed optimism that his victory and that of his followers “is certain, freedom is near and it will all end in praise.” He also commended his followers for always exploring peaceful measures in the expression of their solidarity, saying he indeed remained very grateful. The IPOB leader is standing trial before Justice Binta Nyako for treasonable felony. Kanu’s lawyer and human rights activist, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, in a statement issued after the visit of his legal team, said his client was sure of freedom soonest. He said, “Today, March 14, 2022, we visited our amiable client, Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, at the headquarters of the DSS, Abuja. We had frank and fruitful discussions, which dwelt predominantly on prospects of his forthcoming case and other strategic legal measures to be adopted upon the delivery of the ruling. “Onyendu also expressed his implicit confidence in our indefatigable legal team led by the erudite and distinguished learned silk, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN). “Also prominent is our untiring effort to ensure that orders of the court are henceforth obeyed to the letter by the DSS. “Onyendu is firm and unshaken in his convictions and consequently encourages millions of his followers to follow suit. Onyendu recognises the Ezigbo Umuchineke, who have remained extraordinary, firm and resolute in their resolve. “He is indeed very proud of you all as you continue to show the world what the exemplary peaceful expression of one’s inalienable rights to self-determination represents.”  Copyright PUNCH.
