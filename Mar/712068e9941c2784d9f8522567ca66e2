The FCT Minister of State, Dr Ramatu Aliyu has called for improved sanitation among residents of the territory to get the best of adequate water supply. According to her, the benefit of having an adequate water supply would be defeated if they don’t engage in the hygienic practice, adding that portable water and hygienic practice had a role to play in the human capital development of the country. The minister stated this at the 2022 World Water Day in Abuja with the theme: “Groundwater: Making the Invisible, Visible” on Tuesday. She said, “The optimal benefits that accrue from adequate water supply cannot be achieved without a corresponding improved sanitation and hygiene practices. “Access to adequate potable water and improved sanitation and hygiene practices, play important roles in defining the human capital development of a nation. “In recognition of this, I performed a historic declaration of a State of Emergency in Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) in the Federal Capital Territory.” She also said the administration had constructed no fewer than 192 rural water supply schemes in the six area councils.
