The outgoing Chairman of Anambra Internal Revenue Service, Dr David Nzekwu, has said taxpayers in the state are evading about N513.9bn in taxes. He also said the Internally Generated Revenue profile of the state grew from N17b in 2018 to N30.9bn as of the end of 2021. He disclosed this in Awka during his press conference as the chairman of the agency. He added that the N513.9bn was owed by over 2.1 million potential tax payers enrolled and uploaded on the state’s digital database. He said, “One of the core beliefs we have is that to solve the challenges of revenue administration, we have to set up an architecture for information technology deployment, this will enable people to do transactions with us. “We set up a system that will be able to bill every individual tax payer in the state and also receipt every taxation, that is what gave rise to Anambra Social Service Identity number where each taxpayer has an account with the government.”  Copyright PUNCH.
