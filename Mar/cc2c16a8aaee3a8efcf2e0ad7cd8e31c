The African Democratic Congress has berated the Federal Government over its delay in resolving the current ASUU strike. This was contained in a statement issued by the Forum Chairman and Chairman, Delta State Chapter of the Party, Prince Joe Chukwu, in Asaba on Tuesday. He noted that the forum of the ADC Chairmen in the 36 states of the federation and the FCT, had recently in their meeting, tasked the FG to, as a matter of urgency, address the pressing issues of insecurity, and the ASUU strike, as it is negatively affecting the citizens. The statement read in part, “ADC Chairmen’s Forum frowned at the current ASUU strike in Nigeria. “We are calling on the Federal Government to negotiate with them for the good of Nigerian students, growth and development of education sector in the country. “We gravely discountenance the lingering contractual quagmire between ASUU and the Federal Government that has kept our University system under the torment of incessant ASUU strike. “This culture of disruptions of Academic programme by ASUU strike keeps frustrating the ambitions and aspiration of Nigeria students in the process of acquiring knowledge. “This latest episode calls for concern and a rethink. This is the 16th strike since Nigeria’s return to democracy in 1999. Despite the numbers, there is little to show,” the statement said. The forum, therefore, called on the Federal Government to genuinely look into the demand of ASUU and settle the issue, saying that tertiary institution is the research centre of our national growth and development.
