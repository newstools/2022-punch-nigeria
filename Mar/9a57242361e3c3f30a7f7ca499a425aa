The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), late Wednesday hosted the National Chairmanship aspirants of the All Progressives Congress to a dinner at his residence at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The meeting comes after Tuesday night’s screening exercise by the Aminu Masari-led Screening Committee, which took place at the Katsina State Governor’s Lodge, Asokoro, yesternight at 10pm.
