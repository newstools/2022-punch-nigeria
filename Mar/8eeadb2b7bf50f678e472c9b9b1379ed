In commemoration of World Glaucoma Week scheduled from 6 to March 12, 2022,  this is an initiative to raise awareness and sensitise the public on glaucoma as a public health concern and leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, with the theme, The world is bright, save your sight. Glaucoma is an eye disease that causes damage to the optic nerve leading to loss of vision.  It is often characterised by the build-up of pressure in the eyes known as intraocular pressure. A raised eye pressure is a threat of damage to the optic nerve. Glaucoma is the silent thief of sight. It gives no warning.  Most people living with glaucoma are not aware of it. Anyone can become a victim. In its early stage, glaucoma patients may not notice any symptoms or even experience poor vision. Any vision lost when detected can never be restored. Those at risk of glaucoma are people over 40 years; people with a family history; those who suffer from diabetes and high blood pressure; people who have suffered an eye injury/trauma; the black race and people who have been on long term steroid use. Early detection of this silent thief earns you the great opportunity of stopping further deterioration (vision loss) and preserving your vision for the years to come. Glaucoma is only revealed through a comprehensive eye examination. Commit to an annual eye test. Diagnosis of glaucoma is not a death sentence.  Be faithful to your treatment plan and save your sight from further deterioration. Blindness from glaucoma is irreversible but avoidable. Save your sight! Go see your eye care practitioner! Chioma Nwogwugwu, Optometrist, Public Health Expert, 08063570107: Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
