World boxing heavyweight champion, Oleksandr Usyk, on Tuesday, said he was back home in Ukraine and ready to take up arms in defending against Russia’s invasion of his country. Asked why he had returned, Usyk replied, “What do you mean, why? It’s my duty (to fight); to defend my home, my family; I have to do this”. Speaking to CNN from a basement in Kyiv, the 35-year-old pugilist said he did not want to hurt anybody, but would not hesitate to take whatever measures necessary to protect himself and his loved ones. “My soul belongs to the Lord, and my body and my honor belong to my country — to my family. So there is no fear. Absolutely no fear!” Usyk affirmed his confidence. Usyk’s last appearance in the ring was in September 2021, when he became world heavyweight champion, winning a unanimous decision against Anthony Joshua. Usyk was not the only boxing champion to take up arms to defend his country from Russia’s blitzkrieg. Former world heavyweight champion and Mayor of Kiev, Vitali Klitschko, also revealed to CNN on Tuesday that he was proud of Ukrainian citizens for manning up to defend their country, saying it was a fight for their future.
