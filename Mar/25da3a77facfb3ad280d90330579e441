Nigerian movie marketer, Kazim Adeoti, has broken the silence on his marriage to ace actress, Mercy Aigbe, as he opened up on how they got married. This is as the couple graced the front cover of the March 2022 issue of Media Room Hub magazine, marking the first time Adeoti opened up on their quiet marriage. Adeoti revealed that he and Mercy had been business partners for 10 years, and he had always noticed something special about her. “Mercy has always been a business partner and I’ve always seen something very special. The first thing that got me attracted to her was that she was very open and truthful to me from the first transaction we had together,” Adeoti said. He revealed that when he gave her money for movie production, the actress returned some part of the money that remained after the production. Adeoti noted that he had never experienced such in his dealing with movie production. The movie marketer also noted that he advised Mercy against leaving her first “abusive” marriage with her former husband, Lanre Gentry. According to Kazim, the actress wasn’t happy with his advice and that slowed their business relationship. However, they reconnected after a very successful movie produced by Aigbe, which she sold to Adeoti. After the success of the movie, Adeoti said he gave Aigbe some money and invited her for dinner; an act that rekindled their relationship and eventually led to their marriage. He also posited that he was never friends with Lanre Gentry though they knew each other before the recent marriage. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
