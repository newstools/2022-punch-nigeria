Gospel singer and minister, Nathaniel Bassey, has revealed that his two children always came to him for special prayers whenever they played games. He noted that he was often bewildered when his children made such requests, as he wondered what kind of prayer he was supposed to pray for them. The trumpeter, who made this known on his Twitter page, added that his kids would claim that his prayers didn’t work when they lost in the games. “Our two children, boy and girl. When they play a game against each other, they each come to me for special prayers to win. How can I pray this kind of prayer? When one loses, I’ll hear ‘Daddy, the prayer didn’t work’,” Bassey tweeted on Tuesday. The Onise Iyanu crooner is popular for his regular night prayer sessions held across several social media platforms. The prayer and praise sessions coined as ‘Hallelujah Challenge’ has over 40,000 virtual attendees per night. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
