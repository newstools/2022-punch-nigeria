Enlisted in the Nigeria Police Force on March 15, 1988, as a Cadet Assistant Superintendent of Police, Joseph Egbunike rose to the pinnacle of his career as a Deputy Inspector General of Police in charge of Force Criminal Investigations Department. But the enviable career of the Nsukka-born indigene of Anambra State ended suddenly when he breathed his last on March 8, 2022, at the National Hospital, Abuja, after a brief illness, whilst in active service. Egbunike died three months to his 60th birthday on June 4. Before his death and the abrupt end of his towering career, Egbunike featured prominently in a number of controversial issues of national interest. Egbunike in October 2021 came to the rescue of Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh, when her estranged lover, one Prince Kpokpogri, stormed the Transcorp Hilton Hotel in Abuja, with two police guards in a bid to retrieve a Lexus SUV parked by Dikeh, who lodged there. Kpokpogri allegedly blocked the vehicle with his car and when cautioned, his police escorts reportedly threatened to shoot a female worker of the hotel. Egbunike had immediately directed a Commissioner of Police to arrest Kpokpogri for breach of public peace but later release him on bail. Dikeh and her erstwhile lover had been in the news for months following their messy break-up, with the latter accusing the actress of promiscuity, while she described him as a blackmailer. The DIG, in an interview with The PUNCH, had dismissed reports that he arrested Kpokpogri to please Dikeh. Egbunike had stated, “I only met the suspect and the complainant for the first time; I don’t know where they came from. It has to do with the criminal issue that happened at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel. We went there to do a threat analysis that somebody was trying to cause a situation. “So, I sent my commissioner to go and bring them only to be surprised to see the two parties…The suspect has been released on bail. Besides, the matter we are treating is disturbance of public space, not their relationship, which another commissioner is treating.” On August 2, 2021, the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, constituted a Special Investigation Panel headed by Egbunike to probe fraud allegations involving suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police and former Head, Intelligence Response Team, Abba Kyari. Kyari is under investigation for his alleged involvement in a $1.1m Internet fraud allegedly perpetrated by an Instagram influencer, Abbas Ramon, popularly known as Hushpuppi and four others; AbdulRahman Juma (Abdul); Vincent Kelly Chibuzo (Kelly); Rukayat Motunrayo Fashola (Morayo); and Bolatito Agbabiaka (Bolamide). During the panel’s sittings, Kyari appeared several times before Egbunike and others where he dismissed the allegations of conniving with Hushpuppi to defraud a Qatari businessman. Findings by The PUNCH had revealed that Kyari was relaxed and cordial during the probe, a situation that gave the DCP the confidence that he would be absolved of the allegations. Findings also showed that Egbunike and Kyari had a long term relationship since the former was an Assistant Commissioner of Police in the police Accounts Department where he served for over 15 years. Egbunike on August 26, 2021 submitted the panel’s report, which he said “is an outcome of a painstaking, transparent and exhaustive investigative process.” The IGP, after foot-dragging and dillydallying for weeks, submitted the panel’s report to the Police Service Commission but not satisfied, the Commission, at various times till January 27, 2022, directed the IGP to deepen investigation into Kyari’s alleged collusion with Hushpuppi and his accomplices. Amid the request for Kyari’s extradition to the United States by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency on February 14, 2022, revealed that Kyari belonged to a drug cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline. The anti-narcotics agency also said Kyari contacted one of its officers in Abuja and struck a deal to secure the release of a total of 25kg seized cocaine. The NDLEA added that it had photo and video evidence against Kyari, adding that the cop offered $61,400 to NDLEA officers who played along with him until his arrest. Embarrassed, the IGP on the same day, handed over Kyari to the NDLEA for prosecution, and noted that incontrovertible evidence indicted Kyari in drug crimes. A police report released afterwards showed that Hushpuppi’s gang paid N235, 120, 000 to Kyari’s younger brother, one that exposed the shoddy work that Egbunike’s panel did on the DCP’s probe. Earlier in August 2021, Egbunike and some top police officers were accused of N1bn fraud by an online medium, Foundation for Investigative Journalism. The medium alleged that Egbunike joined other police chiefs to approve more than N1bn for some police transit camp projects in Benue, Bauchi, Plateau, Katsina and Kano States. However, FIJ reported that after a visit to the project locations, nothing or little had been done — three years later. The platform also said Egbunike was in his former role as Commissioner of Police in charge of Budget and Finance at the Force Headquarters when the approval for the sham projects was given. On December 14, 2021, the IGP ordered the detention FIJ’s founder, ‘Fisayo Soyombo, at the Force Headquarters in Abuja, over the allegation but the journalist was released on bail hours later after public outcry. Announcing the passing of Egbunike in a statement on Wednesday, the IGP described the late DIG as a fine policeman who was instrumental to many police achievements. The statement signed by acting Force Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, partly read, “DIG Egbunike was a dedicated and seasoned police officer who served the nation in various capacities including as the Commissioner of Police in charge of Police Accounts and Budget. An officer with finesse and commitment to intellectual development and was instrumental to the achievements of the giant strides within the Police architecture. “The Inspector-General of Police hereby condoles with the immediate family, relatives, and friends of the deceased DIG who passed away in active service of his fatherland and prays for the repose of his soul.” According to his resume, Egbunike joined the Force because of his “passion for service to humanity and generational tradition in policing as a profession.” The deceased also enjoyed reading, swimming, walking, playing squash and loves horticulture. Egbunike attended Ezechima Primary School, Onitsha from 1968 to 1971. He moved to Ogboli Primary School, Onitsha in 1971 and remained there till 1973 when he left for Christ the King College, Ontisha from 1973 to 1980. Egbunike bagged B.Sc (Accountancy) from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka from 1981 to 1985. He later moved to the University of Lagos, Akoka, where he obtained a Masters in International Law & Diplomacy between 1995 and 1997. Apparently moved by a hunger for knowledge, Egbunike studied Law at the Lagos State University, Ojo from 1996 to 2002 where he bagged LL.B Hons. He would later obtain a PhD in Criminology at the University of Abuja between 2004 to 2010. Until his death, Egbunike was a member of the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria, Nigeria Bar Association, Nigeria Institute of Management, International Association of Chiefs of Police, Chartered Institute of Cost Management, Institute of Fraud Examiners, Chartered Institute of Taxation, Procurement Professionals Association of Nigeria, and the Institute of Directors · Deputy Inspector-General of Police (Finance and Administration until death)
