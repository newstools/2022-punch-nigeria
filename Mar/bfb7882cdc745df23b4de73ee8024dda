Political activities picked up in Katsina on Sunday when groups and supporters of the Secretary to Katsina State Government, Alhaji Mustapha Inuwa, from the 34 local government areas of the state stormed the state capital, urging him on his ambition to become the governor in 2023. The SSG, who held a meeting with his supporters at the Katsina motel for almost three hours, however, counselled them to conduct their activities in line with the electoral guidelines. He also urged them to be accommodating of other people’s views and not be violent. Inuwa told his supporters that they should expect challenges in his efforts at ruling the state in the next political dispensation but assured them that with their support and prayers, his dreams would become a reality in 2023. The SSG said 18 out of the 34 members of the state House of Assembly were supporting his ambition, adding that the number would increase before the party primaries. He declared, “I appreciate you all for your support. We should, however, not deceive ourselves that there would not be challenges in our desire to rule the state in 2023. I will advise you to eschew violence, conduct yourself in line with the guidelines guiding political activities and accommodate other people’s rights and views. “As I am meeting you today, 18 members of our House of Assembly are in support of our desire to rule the state. The number will hopefully increase before the primaries; 23 local government chairmanship aspirants are also with us. I will, however, urge us to listen to our political leader, His Excellency, Governor Aminu Masari, and work as a team so that our great party will emerge victorious at the April 11, 2022 council election.” Copyright PUNCH.
