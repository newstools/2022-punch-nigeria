Joe Joyce’s manager has confirmed contact has been made with Anthony Joshua, but has questioned whether his British rival will take the fight as he awaits a world title rematch with Oleksandr Usyk. Joshua activated a rematch clause to fight again for the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles after Usyk stunned him last September, but it is unclear when the Ukrainian will be ready to return to the ring amid his country’s invasion by Russia. In recent weeks both Joshua and Joyce have expressed interest in facing each other, while Joyce’s promoter Frank Warren said this week that he had made “initial contact” with Joshua’s representatives over a possible bout. “I think it’s a great fight for Joe, the team think it’s a great fight for Joe,” Adam Morallee of S-JAM management said. “Joe would love the fight, but I don’t think AJ fancies the fight. “He’s looking for an interim fight between now and fighting Usyk, I don’t think he wants a big fight, I don’t think he wants to test himself in that way, with a big test. I think he wants something a bit easier.” Joshua, who has largely been quiet about his future out of respect for Usyk’s situation, took to social media on Thursday evening to say that an announcement was coming “soon”. Since it became apparent that there could be a delay to the rematch with Usyk, several top heavyweights have expressed an interest in facing Joshua, including the likes of Otto Wallin and Luis Ortiz. His decision over his next move comes as fellow British heavyweights Tyson Fury and Dillian Whyte prepare to meet on April 23, with Fury’s WBC title on the line. Morallee suggests that, if Usyk were to remain unable to fight due to the situation in Ukraine, the winner of a possible Joshua-Joyce bout could go on to face the winner of Fury versus Whyte.
