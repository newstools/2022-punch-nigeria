Nigerian dancer, Korra Obidi, has revealed why she couldn’t tell her side of the story in the ongoing divorce saga with her American husband, Justin Dean. According to her, she was trying to stay strong for her kids but once she’s stronger, she’d tell her part of the story. The US-based dancer went on Facebook live on Saturday to state that she was being judged because of her husband’s one-sided story concerning their divorce. Dean had announced that he was going to divorce his wife last month, a few days after they welcomed their second daughter together. Speaking on the divorce, Korra said, “When I can talk about my story. I will talk about it. When I’m able to tell my story, I’ll share everything with you guys. “Until then, please be patient with me. And please know that I have two girls that I have to take care of. If I’m not there, nobody will.” Dean, who has been vocal about his divorce for over a week now, also announced that he would be filling out the paperwork soon. In a recent Instagram post, the father-of-two noted that he was leaving the marriage because of his mental health. He wrote, “I’m heartbroken! Anyone that knows me or watches me online knows that I’m a dedicated family man to both Korra and my children.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
