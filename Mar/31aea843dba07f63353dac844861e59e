The National Youth Service Corps has advised corps members to ignore online messages from “criminals” offering postings to preferred locations. The agency stressed that postings and relocation were done free of charge, and warned them against making payments to anyone for the purposes. A statement on Wednesday by the Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations, NYSC, Emeka Mgbemena, said the Director-General, Major General Shuaibu Ibrahim, issued the warning while addressing the 2022 Batch ‘A’ Stream One corps members at the Yakubu Gowon NYSC Permanent Orientation Camp, Fanisau, Jigawa State. He also warned that it was criminal to present fake medical reports for the purpose of obtaining concessional postings, adding that anyone caught doing so would face the full wrath of the law. Ibrahim decried the situation whereby some prospective corps members with serious illnesses concealed their conditions in the course of registering for enlistment in the national service. According to him, the essence of disclosure of the true state of health by prospective corps members was to help with decisions regarding their deployment, level of participation in camp activities and medical care. Ibrahim called on corps members to be guided by the spirit and letters of the oath of allegiance they swore to within and beyond the service period. The NYSC DG also enjoined them to continue to preach the messages of peace and unity wherever they found themselves. Ibrahim advised the corps members to make patriotism, honesty and hard work their watchwords, stressing that they should be focused on their dreams. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
