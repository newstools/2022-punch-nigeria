The House of Representatives has voted against Bill 16 which proposed life pension for presiding officers of the National Assembly, in the ongoing amendment to the 1999 Constitution. While 162 members voted for the provision, 193 voted no and three others abstained. The votes failed to meet the required two-thirds or 240 of the 360 members of the House. The beneficiaries would have included President of the Senate, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Deputy President of the Senate, and Deputy Speaker of the House.
