Former Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha, on Sunday said that if the possibility of a Bola Tinubu and Rocha’s ticket emerged ahead of the 2023 presidential election, he would clinch it. Okorocha, a former governor of Imo, said this while fielding questions from newsmen at the All Progressives Congress National Convention in Abuja. He said, “Uncle Tinubu and I are most likely to be. I know that at the appropriate time it may be because he is the one pushing up in the South-West and I am in the South-East. “So let us see what happens between us, and if that is it, I will ask him to relax a bit so that we can move this section forward. “The people naturally love me and I think it is because they believe I care, they believe I love and have sympathy for humanity, they believe I am detribalised. “They believe I do not know religion or tribe, Muslim Christian, Igbo or Hausa, Yoruba, all I see is a human being and that is what makes the difference on my side.’’ Okorocha urged Nigerians to use their voter cards well because it was worth much more than they thought.
