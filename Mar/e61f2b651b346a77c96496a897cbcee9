Prominent Nigerians, including the Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Ogunwusi and the Chief of Staff to the President Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, on Friday witnessed the turbaning of Dr Alimi AbdulRazaq as the second Mutawali of Ilorin by the Emir, Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari. Speaking at the event, Osinbajo, who was a Nigerian Law School mate of Alimi, congratulated him on the conferment of the title of Mutawali. The Vice President, who said Alimi brought many sterling qualities to the royal title, stated, “His accomplishments in law, education and participation in banking industry are testaments to the qualities of Dr Alimi AbdulRazaq. He follows in succession to his late father, Alhaji AGF AbdulRazaq (SAN) as the first Mutawali of Ilorin. “We can all attest to the fact that the new Mutawali of Ilorin brings many qualities to the title. The first class mind has navigated the legal profession and the complex world of business and politics at the highest level possible strictly on the merit of his capacity and the weight of his contributions.” Osinbajo applauded the Mutawali’s outstanding contributions to human rights protection in Africa, which he said set the framework for the establishment of Africa Court for Human and Peoples Rights. The Emir of Ilorin said Alimi and the AbdulRazaqs of Ilorin deserve the honour from Emirate for their sterling contributions to the ancient city, Kwara State and Nigeria as a whole.  Copyright PUNCH.
