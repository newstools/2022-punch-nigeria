THE Rivers State Government has announced the demotion of 14 principals of public schools, as well as the withdrawal of the operational licences of 21 private schools over their alleged involvement in examination malpractices. The state Commissioner for Education, Prof. Kaniye Ebeku, disclosed this to journalists in Port Harcourt on Monday. Ebeku said the action followed a letter written to the state Ministry of Education by the West African Examination Council containing a list of 35 secondary schools in the state that have been delisted for malpractices in the conduct of WAEC exams in 2021. The commissioner said, “We received a letter from WAEC containing the list of 35 secondary schools in the state that have been delisted for the purpose of writing WAEC examinations and their offences. “This bothered on the fact that it was discovered that there were some malpractices in the conduct of last year’s examinations. “Upon receipt of the letter, we immediately invited the affected schools to a meeting. “We presented this information to them, and found that those at the helms of affairs in the various schools allowed this sort of situation to arise. Following that, we decided on certain sanctions. “For all principals who are still in service and who superintended at the time this situation arose, we have directed that they be demoted. “For all schools that are found in the list, we have directed that their licences to operate be withdrawn forthwith.” He said the state government led by Governor Nyesom Wike does not condone any form of examination malpractices, whether in public and private schools in the state.
