The Federal Government says Nigerian students displaced by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war may complete their studies in European countries including Poland, Romania, Hungary and Greece. Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gabriel Aduda, made this known on Friday while receiving some Nigerian student escapees from Ukraine at the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport, Abuja. Aduda said, “Government is already talking with the government of Poland, Greece, Romania and Hungary to see if those of them in their fifth and sixth medical year can actually go back to the universities in these countries to complete their studies.” The students arrived at the airport at exactly 6:35 pm on an Air Peace flight. The stranded Nigerians were evacuated to Nigeria following the intervention of the Federal Government with the cooperation of governments of countries neighbouring Ukraine. Aduda also said the Nigerian Government has made all necessary arrangements to ensure that no Nigerian is left stranded in any of the countries where they have fled to. The Federal Government also gave all returnees from Ukraine $100 (about N48,000) to journey home. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
