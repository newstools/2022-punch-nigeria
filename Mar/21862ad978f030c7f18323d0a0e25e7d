Alhaji Salisu Dambatta, Director of Publicity of the All Progressives Congress has debunked reports that John Akpanudoedehe resigned as the Secretary of the party’s Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee. Dambatta, in a press statement on Saturday, said Akpanudoedehe remains the party’s CECPC secretary. Dambatta said this while reacting to reports in the media that Akpanudoedehe had resigned his position following the leadership change in the party. “We wish to note that the Secretary of the APC CECPC, Akpanudoedehe never sent a resignation letter to the party to the best of its knowledge and neither was he sacked as some social media blogs have speculated. “All those are utterly false, the APC is one family, the CECPC is one unit,” he said. Dambatta said that the party had an Acting Chairman in the person of Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger. According to him, Bello is racing against time to deliver a national convention and committee members are united in supporting him in carrying out the mandate. “Please, disregard social media stories that are not rooted in fact or even sound reasoning,” he said. New national executives are expected to be elected at the APC national convention slated for March 26. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
