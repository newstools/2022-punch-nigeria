Oluwasegun Babalola Wife of Anambra State Governor-elect, Mrs Nonye Soludo, on Monday, called for sustained awareness to end gender inequality and promote women’s inclusiveness in governance. Soludo made the call in a statement in Awka, in commemoration of the 2022 International Women’s Day, marked every March 8. The theme: ‘Gender Equality Today For A Sustainable Tomorrow’, is marked to celebrate women’s achievement, promote equality and awareness against bias. According to her, a level-playing field amenable to egalitarianism should be prioritised, in order to foster amity and political balance. “This year’s theme captures the inner voice of all women and girls around the world, who are constantly seeking an avenue to establish their potential. “With issues such as climate change, environmental and disaster risk reduction, which are some of the greatest global challenges of the 21 century, it is a strong reminder that the importance of women and girls to the world cannot be over emphasised. “Without gender equality today, a sustainable future, and an equal future remains beyond reach,” she said.
