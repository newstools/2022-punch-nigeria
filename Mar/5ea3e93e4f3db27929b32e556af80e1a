Nigerian actor, Yul Edochie, has lamented the attitude of some up-and-coming actors in the Nollywood industry. In an Instagram post on Thursday, the actor noted that some new actors do not respect those who have been in the industry before them. The 40-year-old, who shared a clip from a 2005 movie, said that he has been consistent in the Nollywood scene for 17 years. Yul Edochie wrote, “When you see me now collecting big artiste fees and living well, don’t beef, and stop shouting ‘God when?’. “We’re not mates. That’s me, the guy holding the guitar. Movie Title: New Jerusalem. Shot in 2005. 17 years of hard work and consistency so far. “Success takes time. Some young Nollywood actors now, after just two years of hustle, they’re already complaining that they haven’t made it. “Some have no respect for their ‘seniors’. They want to chill with the big boys. “Calm down, put in the work. Be patient and consistent. Your time will come.” See post below:  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
