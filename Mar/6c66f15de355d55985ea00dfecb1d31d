The Director General of the National Boundary Commission, Adamu Adaji, has said that Nigeria is ready to resolve all the lingering disputes between it and the Benin Republic. According to him, this would further aid the promotion of trans-border cooperation between the two countries. Adaji spoke at the opening of a meeting of the Joint Standing Committee on the Delimitation of the Nigeria/Benin Republic international boundary which held in Abuja. These were contained in a statement by the commission’s Head Information Unit, Efe Ovuakporie, on Monday. The statement read, “The meeting was predicated on the need to resolve all outstanding boundary-related disputes between Nigeria/Benin to create an enabling environment for the provision of infrastructure that will promote trans-border cooperation as well as develop facilities that will ensure socio-economic integration of the border dwellers. “There is no doubt that the resolution of all boundaries-related disputes would pave way for the enhanced collaboration in the execution of joint programmes which will promote the quality of lives of our border communities.” He recalled that the last meeting held in November 2020 at Ketou, Benin Republic had earlier agreed on a programme of activities to be undertaken by the joint field team. He added, “The aim of that meeting was geared towards the resolution of two critical thorny areas along the common border in Toungegi Island and in the Igbokofi/Towe sector. “It is imperative that both countries advance further. The bilateral relations between the two countries can never be compromised.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
