The Executive Committee, Journalists Estate Phase One, Arepo, has said the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, is set to construct a pedestrian bridge at Arepo, in the Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State. A statement signed by the estate’s Chairman, Jide Oke; and the General Secretary, Yinka Shokunbi, confirmed the development. Oke and Shokunbi noted that a five-man delegation visited the community to map out the location where the bridge would be constructed. The statement read, “A team of technical experts from the office of the Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola, has visited Arepo on Km 18, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, for location siting of a pedestrian bridge. “The five-man team led by Engrs. Oladele and Moses Linus were at Arepo on Sunday, following letters written to the minister by the executive committee of Journalists Estate, Arepo, on the frequently occurring pedestrian mishaps.” “Journalists Estate last February wrote a reminder to the minister after a 60-year-old man who reportedly arrived for his daughter’s celebration, was killed while trying to dash across the newly-reconstructed eight-lane expressway. “The graphics of the incident were immediately forwarded to the minister electronically by the executive committee of Journalists Estate Phase One and were also attached by mail to the office of the minister for his immediate action. “The visiting team of engineering experts assured us that once their report is submitted and approval is given, work would be expected to commence on the construction of the pedestrian bridge.”  Copyright PUNCH.
