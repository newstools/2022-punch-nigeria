BluePeak Private Capital’s $200m fund has qualified for the 2X Challenge, in recognition of its work and further commitment to accelerate women’s economic empowerment and promote gender equality. In a statement, it explained that the 2X Challenge is a global gender finance initiative first launched in 2018 by the development finance institutions of the G7 countries, with the aim of mobilising $15bn by the end of 2022 to support projects that empower women and enhance their economic participation. While noting the relevance of International Women’s Day, BluePeak Private Capital said it is committed to investing with a gender lens using the 2X Challenge criteria. “Specifically, the 2X Challenge’s $15bn pledge seeks to provide a capital boost to women-centred projects in developing countries that improve access to leadership opportunities, quality employment, finance, enterprise support and products and services that enhance economic participation and opportunities. “Founding members of the 2X Challenge include CDC Group (UK), Proparco (France), JICA and JBIC (Japan), DFC (US), FinDev Canada (Canada), DEG (Germany) and CDP (Italy). “The European Investment Bank was the first multilateral development bank to adopt and use the 2X criteria. BluePeak Private Capital is proud that four of its investors – CDC, DFC, EIB and FMO – are all members of the 2X Challenge.” Evidence suggests that supporting women in business has a direct impact on economies achieving inclusive economic growth, the statement said.
