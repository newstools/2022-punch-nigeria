No fewer than 3,000 Gombe patients are receiving free eye treatment in the ongoing cataract surgery services. The services were organised by the Gombe State First Lady through her Jewel Care Foundation in collaboration with Qatar Charity and Future Leaders Foundation. The Governor’s wife, Asma’u Yahaya, on Saturday, said the initiative became imperative due to the varying eye challenges of residents of the state. She expressed concern over the increase in the number of eye-related ailments, calling on citizens of the state to avail themselves of the opportunity. Yahaya said, “There is a need for people to avail themselves of this opportunity to improve their health conditions. “2000 patients will receive treatment, medication of various eye ailments 800 eyeglasses will be issued to those that require them and over 300 cataract patients will undergo surgery.” According to the wife of the governor, the one-week medical outreach scheduled from 24th – 30th March 2022, will involve screening exercises of patients at the three general hospitals. In June 2021, a similar exercise was carried out by the First Lady’s foundation in partnership with Qatar Charity and Future Leaders Foundation, where over 2,000 persons benefited. Copyright PUNCH.
