The Inspector General of Police, Mr Usman Baba, has approved a new dress code for women police officers in Nigeria. This announcement was made in a statement on Friday by the Acting Force Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi. The Police PRO announced that the “new and improved” dress code would now allow female police officers to wear stud earrings. Adejobi said the female police officers would also be permitted to wear headscarves under their berets or peak caps while in uniform. He said that the dress code was unveiled during the IGP’s meeting with strategic police managers on Thursday. “The police have workforce from every local government in the country with different ethnic and religious backgrounds. “This, therefore, brings the need to guarantee inclusion, gender mainstreaming, ethnic and religious diversity in the workplace for optimum output and professionalism. “This has informed the improvement for effective global workforce diversity management. “Other countries that have adopted same dress code include Canada, the United States of America, Sweden, Turkey, Australia and the United Kingdom,” he said. The spokesperson also noted that the dress code was optional but added that senior women police officers had been urged to ensure compliance with the approved standard for those who would adopt it. “This development was in line with international best practices, to address the growing concern for gender mainstreaming and respect for culture and diversity,” he added.
