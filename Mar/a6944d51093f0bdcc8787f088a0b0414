Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, has disclosed his plan to peopled his cabinet with ministers below the age of 35 years if he is elected as president in 2023. The plan, he said, was in line with his long-time belief that the younger generations have a lot to contribute to Nigeria’s development. Saraki stated this when some young supporters raise N40 million for his Presidential Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms. Announcing his plans in a series of tweets on his Twitter page on Tuesday, Saraki said the youths, who are young professionals that raised the money were convened by Abubakar Danmusa. He wrote, “Last night, I was truly touched by the gesture of the young professionals convened by Abubakar Danmusa, who helped to raise the N40 million for my Presidential Expression of Interest Form and my Nomination Form. “These young people, who went out of their way to rally their friends, family, and coworkers, made contributions of N500,000 to N2 million to reach their desired goal. “This symbolic gesture, a first of its kind in the history of our nation, is also a challenge to me. Now, I promise to work twice as hard as I originally intended. I promise to meet the yearning and aspirations of all our young people to run a modern government. “As it stands, this is a clarion call. This is why I make this promise: “When I become President on the 29th of May 2023, all the Ministers of State in my Cabinet will be experienced young people who are under the age of 35. “We have our work cut out for us.
