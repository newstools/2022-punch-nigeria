A human rights organisation, Coalition of Civil Society for Good Governance, on Wednesday demanded the rotation of power to the South in the 2023 Presidency, saying the job should be given to former President Goodluck Jonathan. The Convener of the organisation’s #thenextpresident project, Jacob Okpanachi; and its North East coordinator, Kanada Saleh, made their position known in a communiqué issued after the organisation’s multi-stakeholders consultation tour and engagement to the North. The CSO said it decided to undertake a consultation tour of Northern Nigeria with the view to “x-ray leadership profiles that would fit in the final project 2023 through consolidated consultation thereby providing an open political engagement with a focus on Southern President with a specific focus on President Goodluck Jonathan.” It added, “It is imperative to note that we have been engaged in this search for a Southern President and have consulted and still in consultation with some political leaders, civil society groups, faith, women and students-based organisations as a build up to an intensified campaign for power shift to Southern Nigeria in 2023. “This group has held series of town hall meetings, media engagements, roundtable discourses in the last one year. “We have decided to embark on a tour for consultation and verification on the candidacy of President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan for some reasons amongst which are that he is qualified for the office; he is the immediate past President and has a term; he is from Southern Nigeria which is one of the major focus of the  #thenextpresident project.”  Copyright PUNCH.
