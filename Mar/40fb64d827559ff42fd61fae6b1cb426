All Progressives Congress National Leader, Bola Tinubu, on Tuesday, cancelled his 13th Birthday Colloquium to honour the victims of Kaduna train attack. He made the announcement at Eko Hotels in Lagos, the venue of the 13th Bola Ahmed Tinubu Colloquium with the theme, ‘Pivoting Nigeria Into The New Order’. According to him, the attack was a “national tragedy” and over 60 persons lost their lives to the terror. He said, “Today is supposed to be a very joyful 70th birthday of mine living on earth. I give thanks to God Almighty for being able to survive to this age… “I have just been informed of a very sad incident in our country, very sad indeed, that over 60 people and many more were killed and bombed on a train between Kaduna and Abuja just last night. That is a very serious incident about the security of lives in this country and it calls for a very serious sober reflection. “For me to be here celebrating, dancing and enjoying myself doesn’t show enough concern of a statesman and a senior citizen of this country. “This event should not be holding. I have consulted with the people you see around me here and they’ve agreed with me and being a very highly committed democrat, I have given myself to their suggestion that they agreed that this event be cancelled.” The APC leader, alongside hundreds of others at the event, observed one-minute silence for the lives lost in the spirit of “national tragedy and concern”. Tinubu urged the two clergies at the event to pray for the soul of the departed and for relief for their bereaved family members. Terrorists had attacked the Abuja-Kaduna train on Monday night with hundreds of passengers on board. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
