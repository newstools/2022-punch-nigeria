Some Ward Chairmen of the People’s Democratic Party, in Osun State, on Monday dissociated themselves from a litigation reportedly filled before an Osun State high court sitting in Ijebu-Ijesha, seeking order affirming actions taken by erstwhile state chairman, Soji Adagunodo. The chairmen, in a press statement obtained in Osogbo, stressed that the listing of their names on the case at Ijebu-Ijesha was fraudulent and mischievous. They said they had no knowledge of the case as they were not consulted
before the case was instituted. The chairmen include Ayeni Sunday for Ward 1 Atakumosa West, Aderemi Kabiru for Ward 1 Ifelodun, Adebayo Dare for Ward 4 Atakumosa and Ojo Alegbeleye for Ward 3 Atakumosa West. The statement read in parts, “We are the Chairman of the PDP in ward one, three and of Atakumosa West and ward one Ifelodun Local Government of Osun State. “Our attention was drawn to a case before the Osun State High Court of jebu-jesha Division with suit No:HU/6/2022 in which we were listed as a Plaintiff. “We hereby deny any knowledge about the case as we were not consulted
before the case was instituted.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
