MTN Nigeria Communications Plc has announced it will be offering free calls and SMS to and from Ukraine. The company said the offer is available to all existing prepaid and postpaid customers. According to the telco, the offer is aimed at helping customers stay in touch with family and friends in Ukraine while eliminating the associated international direct dialing costs due to high international telecommunication regulations to Ukraine. A statement quoted the MTN’s Chief Executive Officer, Karl Toriola, as saying, “We understand that some of our customers in Ukraine have experienced challenges to contact their loved ones. “As a result, we have stepped in with support to ensure that our customers, both at home and in Ukraine, are still able to connect with family and friends. All of our customers will benefit from the waived SMS and voice call fees to and from Ukraine. “This blanket waiver has been put in place as an immediate response to the need.” The company added that existing active subscribers on its network would receive 30 minutes of free voice calls and 50 free SMS that would be valid until the end of March. It said in anticipation of concerns with regards to connection issues, it had implemented countermeasures to ensure uninterrupted connectivity. Toriola said, “We’ve worked closely with our industry body GSMA to make the connection easier. Whilst MTN does not have operations in Ukraine, we have heeded the call to remain responsive to our customers in their time of need Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
