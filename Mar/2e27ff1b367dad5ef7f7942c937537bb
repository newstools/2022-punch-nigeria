In this episode of our news review show, we take a look at ‘the slap’ that took place at the inauguration of Professor Charles Soludo as governor of Anambra State. It involved Bianca, the widow of Biafran warlord, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, and former first lady of Anambra, Ebelechukwu Obiano. Watch the video for the gist. Moving on, some members of the National Youth Service Corps in Ibadan protested alleged police shooting. However, police have denied the claim of shooting, saying no bullets were fired at the scene. So what broke the windscreen? Still on trending stories, indigenes of Ile-Ife, Osun State, protested against the emergence of Professor Adebayo Bamire, as the next Vice Chancellor of Obafemi Awolowo University. They said an indigene should have been elected. What do you think? Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
