The Cross River State chapter of Peoples Democratic Party has described the judgement delivered by the Federal High Court Abuja, sacking 20 lawmakers who defected from the PDP to the All Progressives Congress as “victory for the electorate in Cross River State.” The judgement was delivered by Justice Taiwo Taiwo in a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/975/2021 filed by the PDP. In a statement by the State Publicity Secretary of the party, Mike Ojisi, the party said congratulated the electorate for standing formidably with the PDP, while assuring them of more victories ahead. “The State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Barr Venatius Ikem called on other members of the All Progressives Congress to take advantage of the ‘April Transfer’ season and return to the Peoples Democratic Party. The State Chairman expressed optimism that the judgement of the court will be implemented and upheld by the appellate courts. “The Peoples Democratic Party enjoins party faithful to remain steadfast and committed to the party in the quest to reclaiming the party’s mandate stolen by APC.” In his reaction, Publicity Secretary of the APC in Cross River, Mr Erasmus Ekpang, says his party has 90 days to wait for the outcome of the appeal. “Even the judgment of March 21 did not say the lawmakers should be replaced by members of the PDP, the worst scenario is the conduct of a new election after the appeal and Supreme Court time elapses. “APC has taken the judgment in good faith and is confident of the courts but I hope if by tomorrow, the Appeal Court upturns the judgment, PDP will take it in good faith just as we are taking it now,” he said.
