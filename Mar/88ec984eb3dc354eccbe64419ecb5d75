The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, on Sunday, faulted reports that he had conclusively exonerated the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari who is facing trial before Justice Inyang Ekwo of a Federal High Court in Abuja on charges of illegal drug business. Malami said this in a statement issued by his Special Assistant (Media and Public Relations), Dr. Umar Gwandu in Abuja. According to him, there appeared to be a “misunderstanding regarding the issue.” He said, “It was a case of work in progress in respect of which the office of the Attorney General of the Federation requested for further probe in relation to some aspects of investigation. “It was clear that the conclusion on the alleged contradiction on the issue was a clear case of misconception. “The office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice’s stance is that no conclusion has been reached in the direction of absence of evidence relating to the first report. “The issues were raised for further investigation with a view to cover the field in investigation in order to arrive at an informed decision.” Copyright PUNCH.
