The Head, Soludo Media Office, Mr Joe Anatune, has said the swearing-in of the Anambra State governor-elect, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, would be low-keyed. In a statement in Awka on Wednesday, Anatune said the ceremony, which would take place at the Government House, Agu-Awka, would have few guests in attendance and devoid of unbridled celebrations that are usually associated with occasions of such nature. It added that Soludo, after the swearing-in, would inspect a guard of honour and consequently make his inaugural address to the people of the state. The statement also said an inter-denominational service would hold briefly before the new governor sets out to work. The governor-elect, however, expressed gratitude to all for the outpouring of goodwill messages as well as the continuous support from well-wishers and numerous supporters within and across the globe. The statement read in parts, “The Anambra State Governor-elect, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, will officially be sworn in on Thursday (today) as the sixth democratically-elected governor of the state. “Invited guests are expected to be seated by 9am prompt. Similarly, all accredited media houses are to be at the venue before 8am. “After the official swearing in, Prof Chukwuma Soludo will inspect a guard of honour and consequently makes his inaugural address to the people of Anambra State. Thereafter, an inter-denominational service will hold briefly before the new Governor immediately sets out to work “Please note this event is strictly low key and devoid of the usual merry-making and unbridled celebrations usually associated with occasions of this nature.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
