The All Progressives Grand Alliance has condemned the arrest of the former governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano, by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The party described the arrest of the former governor as a “politically-motivated witch-hunt”, saying that the EFCC had resorted to the use of fifth columnists. The anti-graft agency had arrested Obiano on Thursday night at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, hours after he handed over as governor of Anambra State. Addressing journalists in Awka, on Saturday, the National Coordinator, APGA Media Warriors Forum, Evang Chinedu Obigwe, said the allegation that the former governor misappropriated N42bn, out of which N37bn was used to fund political activities was baseless and does not hold water. Obigwe said efforts by the EFCC to dent the hard-earned reputation of Obiano would not succeed as he remains innocent until proven guilty by a competent court of law. He said as of today, Nigerians don’t have confidence in the anti graft agency anymore, saying that “when they see the real corrupt politicians joining APC, they would turn to toothless bulldogs. “But when an opposition figure is involved they will be barking as if the person committed any crime whereas they are doing the evil bidding of their pay masters.” The APGA chieftain maintained that Obiano finished strong and fought a good battle to ensure Anambra remained vibrant, adding that the EFCC’s actions were obviously politically motivated. He added that the party was confident that justice would prevail at last and Obiano would triumph over EFCC and its detractors. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
