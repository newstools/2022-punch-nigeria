A student of the Oriwu Senior Model College, Ikorodu, Lagos State, Abdulazeez Abdulrahman, on Thursday, emerged the winner of the 20th edition of the Spelling Bee competition for public school students held at the Adeyemi-Bero Auditorium, Alausa, Ikeja. The Tutor-General/Permanent Secretary, Education District II, Mrs Anike Adekanye, attributed the feat to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s dynamic approach and enormous investment in the education sector. She expressed delight in the fact that students from the district had made the state government proud in different ways that could not be quantified, particularly by winning laurels in local, national and international competitions. While applauding the students in the district for winning the competition in three consecutive years, Adekanye appreciated the teachers for their dedication and for ensuring that the students delivered successfully on all what they had been taught. “I must applaud the students of the district for their excellent performance in all competitions. The time and efforts put into teaching these students as well as the special attention given to the education sector by Mr Governor are yielding positive results. It is also important to appreciate the teachers, who worked tirelessly and contributed greatly to the district’s success story,” she stated. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
