Two siblings, Esther Kehinde, 20, and David Kehinde, 15, have been kidnapped at Oremeji Street, Joga-Orile area of Ayetoro in the Yewa-North Local Government Area of Ogun State. Our correspondent gathered that the siblings were abducted from their residence around 9pm on Tuesday, while washing their school uniforms A source told our correspondent that the gun-wielding kidnappers invaded the victims’ house and took the siblings away. An elderly man, believed to be the victims’ grandfather, who was reportedly resisting them, was hit in the head and passed out. Our correspondent gathered that the kidnappers contacted the family of the children about 12 hours after and demanded the sum of N15m. The source said, “They (kidnappers) came into our house around 9pm and went to the back, where David and his sister were washing their uniforms. Their grandpa too was seated there when the kidnappers appeared and held the two of them. “The grandpa challenged them, but one of them hit the man on the head and he passed out immediately. Their mother heard the noise and rushed out, but met the kidnappers’ stiff resistance. “They shot in the air for a few minutes before taking to their heels.” When contacted on Thursday, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident, saying the police were on top of the matter. “We will like to use this medium to appeal to the family of the victims to please carry us along in any conversation with these hoodlums,” he said.
