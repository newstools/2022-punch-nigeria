A Federal High Court in Abuja has fixed April 8 for adoption of final addresses in a suit by the Peoples Democratic Party seeking removal from office of Zamfara State Governor, Bello Matawalle, over his defection from the party to the All Progressives Congress. Justice Inyang Ekwo fixed the date on Thursday. Also sought to be sacked alongside the governor are the Senators, House of Representatives members and State House of Assembly members who defected to the ruling party along with Matawalle. Emmanuel Ukala (SAN), who stood for the PDP, confirmed to Justice Ekwo that all his processes have been filed and served on all the defendants while Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN) who stood for the governor and 34 others confirmed similar position. The Independent National Electoral Commission and the APC which are also defendants in the defection suit have joined issues. During Thursday’s proceedings, Justice Ekwo said with completion of exchange of processes by parties, the stage has been set for definite hearing of all pending motions along with the substantive matter. The judge announced that all processes would be adopted on April 8 after which a date for judgment would be fixed. The PDP had dragged the governor and his co-defectors before the court, challenging their defection to another party and praying the court to remove them from their respective offices on the ground of their alleged unlawful defection.
