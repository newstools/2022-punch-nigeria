The Anambra State Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, has commiserated with the family of Dr Chinelo Megafu Nwando, and the Nigerian Medical Association over the unfortunate death of Dr Chinelo Nwando, who lost her life with other Nigerians in the deadly Abuja-Kaduna train attack by terrorists. Dr Nwando lost her life from injuries sustained from gunshots when the Abuja-Kaduna-bound train she was travelling in was attacked by bandit terrorists in the Kateri-Rijana area of Kaduna State on Monday night. In a statement made available to journalists in Awka, on Thursday, the Head of Soludo Media Office, Joe Anatune, said the governor described the late Nwando as a promising young doctor, whose life was cut short in her prime. He also lamented the circumstances leading to her death, describing it as a painful but avoidable situation. Soludo called on the need for the security agencies to rejig the nation’s security architecture so that it becomes more proactive to issues of incessant violent attacks on innocent citizens. Soludo also extended his condolences to families of other Nigerians who lost their lives in the attack. He appealed to the Federal Government to urgently take measures in tackling the worsening insecurity in the country, which has made the nation insecure and vulnerable to extreme violent attacks by bandits and terrorists “Dr Nwando a talented and skilled dentist was born in Umuase Village, Onitsha, Anambra State. She had worked as a medical dentist for Kaduna State Dental Centre and previously as a private dentist at the St. Gerrard Hospital at Kakuri, Kaduna State,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
