Ahousewife, Elizabeth Abu, who was arraigned for allegedly maltreating her stepson, David Ewongolu, has been remanded in police custody till March 22. The detention order was given on Tuesday by an Upper Area Court sitting in Lokoja, Kogi State, where she was arraigned on charges of inflicting bodily harm. The court, presided over by Mopa A. M, granted the request of the police prosecutor for the defendant to be remanded to enable the police to conclude their investigation. Mopa, however, said she should be detained in a conducive police facility, where she could have access to her children. The trial judge ordered that the defendant be remanded for 14 days in the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department. The Secretary to the Government of Kogi State, Mrs Folashade Arike, who spoke to journalists after the ruling, described Abu’s action as callous and barbaric. Abu was arrested by the Kogi State Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development over the abuse of Ewongolu. The victim, in an interview, disclosed that he sustained injuries on his buttock after his stepmom whipped him for using part of his clothes to make a duster. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
