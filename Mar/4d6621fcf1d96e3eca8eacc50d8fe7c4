KANO State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has dissolved the leadership of the Kano State Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture with immediate effect, for failing to conduct fresh elections after the expiration of their tenure. A statement by the Secretary to Kano State Government, Alhaji Usman Alhaji, on Wednesday, said the action became necessary following the inability of the current leadership of the body to organise a fresh and acceptable election long after the expiration of their tenure. The governor, who frowned at the sit-tight attitude of the sacked executive officers, ordered their immediate removal, the statement said. It added that Ganduje had already approved the setting up of a nine-member caretaker committee, under the leadership of an industrialist, Alhaji Lawan Garo, to oversee the affairs of the chamber. The statement said the terms of reference of the committee, among others, are to organise elections within six months, as well as to restore peace and sanity in the entire activities of the chamber. Other committee members include Ambassador Muktari Gashash as co-chair, representative of the Ministry of Commerce, Dr Salim Muhammad; Alhaji Yakubu Uba; Alhaji Tijjani Usman; Alhaji Kabiru Kura; Hajiya Aisha; Sulaiman Baffa; Alhaji Bashir Dado; and Bauran Gaya.
