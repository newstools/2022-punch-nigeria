A second successive double from Victor Osimhen earned Napoli a 2-1 comeback victory over Udinese on Saturday, moving them level on points with Serie A leaders AC Milan. Looking to make it back-to-back league wins for the first time since late January into early February, Napoli fell behind in the 22nd minute after Gerard Deulofeu arrowed a strike into the net. The hosts looked like a different side in the second half, however, and turned the match on its head as striker Osimhen backed up his double in last week’s 2-1 win at Hellas Verona with another brace. His first was a bullet header to level the match seven minutes after the break, before a clever near-post finish 11 minutes later completed the turnaround. Pablo Mari’s late red card ended Udinese’s hopes of grabbing an equaliser at the Diego Armando Maradona stadium, as Napoli saw out a crucial win in the race for the Scudetto. Osimhen’s brace takes his tally to 11 in 20 Serie A games equaling Obafemi Martins’ goal record set during the 2004/05 season. He also became the first Nigerian to score in double figures in two consecutive Serie A campaigns having scored 10 goals in 30 league appearances last season. His brace equals the goal record set by other African players George Weah for AC Milan, Samuel Eto’o for Inter Milan, as well as Mohamed Salah for AS Roma. Since joining Napoli from Lille in an African record fee of €81m in 2020, the Nigerian in all competitions has found the net 25 times in 55 appearances for Napoli, along with seven assists.
