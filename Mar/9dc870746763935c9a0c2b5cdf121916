IN less than eighteen months, Stallion Auto Keke Limited, a member of Stallion Group and Nigeria’s sole distributor of Bajaj three-wheelers and quadricycles, has rolled out 100,000 Bajaj Keke into the nation’s tricycle market. The Managing Director, SAKL and VON Automobiles Nigeria Limited, Mr. Manish Rohtiga, in a statement, attributed the extraordinary feat to his company’s relentless effort towards delivering international quality Keke and creating economic value for Nigerians. He said the company embarked on an overall cost-effective empowerment programme for the Nigerian youths by making the Bajaj Keke the most affordable in the country (N975,000 per unit). Manish said, “To this end, we embarked on empowerment of Nigerians, empowerment of females and empowerment of our staff, thereby creating a winning team, which facilitated the unprecedented production of 100,000 units of Bajaj Keke within a short span of 18 months. “For effectiveness, we also introduced auto finance, an essential ingredient of the nation’s auto industry development plan, thereby working closely with microfinance banks towards empowering Nigerian youths. “While we provide the unemployed youths with riding skills and techniques, our partner Microfinance Banks provide liquidity with a zero-gestation period to ensure their daily income as micro-entrepreneurs.” He stated further, “As a result of the foregoing efforts, driving Keke has, today, become the best micro-entrepreneurship in the country.
