Skeletal activities have resumed on Monday in Awka, the Anambra State capital, as workers are beginning to comply with Governor Chukwuma Soludo’s directive for workers to start resuming at their duty post every Monday, just like any other day. The governor had through the Head of Service, Mr Theodora Igwegbe, issued a statement on Friday, directing workers to start resuming normal activities every Monday. When our correspondent visited the Secretariat complex, Awka, the workers who had resumed duty as of 9:00 am, expressed delight and urged the State Government to provide adequate security and transportation to enable full compliance. However, in Onitsha, Nnewi, and environs, the level of compliance was very low as markets, motor parks, banks, offices, and schools remained shut. Onitsha is a commercial area and the governor had already directed market leaders and motor parks operators to ensure they open for operations from April 4, 2022. Although the Monday sit-at-home, which was introduced by the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra had been suspended by the group, the people are still complying due to fear of being attacked by hoodlums.
