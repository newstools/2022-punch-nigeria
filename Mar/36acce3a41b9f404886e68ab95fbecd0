THE Senator representing Kogi West, Smart Adeyemi, has donated tricycles, motorcycles, grinding and sewing machines to his constituents at Iyara, Ijumu Local Government Area of the state. While the motorcycles were donated to a vigilance group to enhance policing, the tricycles and grinding and sewing machines were aimed at making the beneficiaries self-reliant. The federal lawmaker while speaking at the ceremony on Saturday, said “the mother of all empowerment “ would soon be organised by his office, noting that the programme would be encompassing. “Hopefully by the middle of the year, we will be coming with a much stronger empowerment that will help our people to be able to be self-sustaining so that they can stand on their own and meet the needs of their family,” Adeyemi assured. He said more tricycles and cars would be donated to Kogi West constituents soon to provide succour to the people. Senator Adeyemi noted that this year, more roads would get government attention in Kogi West as the Federal Government has earmarked an additional N1 billion for the rehabilitation of the Kabba-Ilorin Road. According to him, other projects that would be rehabilitated include Odo Ere-Igbaruku and Ayetoro roads. The senator disclosed that he has facilitated several roads rehabilitation in his constituency, including the Ayetoro Gbede-Abugi road, Iyara Township road, and Iyara-Ogidi road, which he said are being renovated.
