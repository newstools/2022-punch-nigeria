A coalition of civil society organisations has accused the Head of Service of the Federation, Dr Folasade Yemi-Esan of involvement in job racketeering despite the embargo placed on employment in the country. The groups under the under the aegis of Coalition of Civil Societies for Equity, Justice and Good governance, also accused her of abusing her office as well as coming up with anti-people policies. They threatened to ground activities at the Federal  Secretariat if she  fails to resign or get sacked in five days. These were contained in a statement on Saturday by the Co-Convener of the group, Danesi Momoh. Speaking during a protest on Thursday in Abuja, Momoh alleged that the HoS blocked 17 federal directors from participating in the permanent secretary examination. He said, “Apart from the official recruitment into the federal civil service, the Head of Service has been known to conduct recruitments through the backdoor for a long time even in the face of the so-called embargo on employment. “Dr Yemi-Esan as Head of Service has contributed greatly to increase the rate of youth unemployment. She has hoarded and controlled the employment process in her favour to maximize the dirty money she makes from the deals. “While President Buhari is intent on ending unemployment in Nigeria, it is a pity that his employee will choose rather to use her office to subvert federal policies and make quick money. Efforts get the reaction of the Head of the Media, Office of the HOS, Abdulganiyu Aminu was unsuccessful as calls to his phone rang out.
