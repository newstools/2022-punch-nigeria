The Authentic Mogajis of Ibadanland, otherwise known as Ibadan Family Heads, have urged the Olubadan-designate, Oba Lekan Balogun, to promote Mogajis on merit only. They advised him to allow the fear of God to be his guiding principle in all things, while congratulating him ahead of his installation as the 42nd Olubadan of Ibadan. The family heads said this in a statement issued on Tuesday by their spokesman, Mogaji Wale Oladoja, who represents the Akinsola family, after their monthly meeting held at the Oja-Oba Olubadan Palace. They said they were proud of the Ibadan culture and tradition, especially the succession process, which they described as a model for other towns to emulate. At the meeting were Mogajis Adekunle Olaonumi (Aperin), Abduljelil Adanla (Adanla),  Wale Bankole (Alago), Ademola Oyewo (Kobomoje), Sheriff Adetunji (Olukusa) and Fatai Olanrewaju. The statement read in part, “After our monthly meeting today, we have decided to continue promoting the unique culture and traditions of Ibadanland. We also congratulate the Olubadan-designate, Dr Lekan Balogun, on his forthcoming installation. “We advise the new Olubadan of Ibadanland to imbibe the fear of God and ensure merit in promoting our members. We know him to be a God-fearing individual and a respected elder statesman. “We wish the Olubadan-designate long life and rapid development of Ibadanland. We also congratulate all sons and daughters of Ibadanland on their steadfastness during the short Olubadan transition.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
