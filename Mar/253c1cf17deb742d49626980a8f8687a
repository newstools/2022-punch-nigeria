A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress and a political scientist, Adekunle Ayoola, has said for Nigerians to join the league of other countries that practised democracy, they must reconsider Diaspora voting. According to him, it is the perfect legal instrument that will allow the over 17 million Nigerians in the Diaspora to vote in the forthcoming 2023 polls. The political scientist, who lives in Poland, said, “The contributions of Nigerians in the diaspora to the stability and growth of the national economy could not be overemphasized as they remitted as much as $25bn in 2019. Saying that people contributing this much to the national growth of the country should be allowed to have a say in its governance is not fair. “The diaspora constitutes a large chunk of highly educated professionals and skilled labour spread across the world with potential to influence different sectors and organisations across the world, thereby using their global exposure to positively impact country’s development. “I plead with the National Assembly to revisit this bill on Diaspora voting without further delay.” Copyright PUNCH.
