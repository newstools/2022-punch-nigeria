THE Lagos State Christian Pilgrims Welfare Board has commenced the statutory medical and administrative screening programme as prerequisite for intending pilgrims. The Commissioner for Home Affairs, Anofiu Elegushi, disclosed this on Thursday during the event at the Archbishop Vining Memorial Cathedral at Ikeja GRA. He said, “Unlike last year where there was only pilgrimage to the Kingdom of Jordan, the authorities of Israel have assured us that their border will be open to pilgrimage this year, hence the pilgrimage will be to Israel and Kingdom of Jordan. We want to ensure that prospective pilgrims are physically and psychologically equipped for pilgrimage to Israel and Kingdom of Jordan scheduled to commence in April/May, 2022. “However, there are conditions attached to it, such as the collection of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the booster doses which the state government will make available for intending pilgrims who have not received the jabs.” The Board Secretary of LSCPWB, Mrs Florence Gbafe, explained that the exercise was organised to acquaint the intending pilgrims with the guidelines of the holy pilgrimage. “There is need to orientate intending pilgrims about the values, customs and behavioural expectations of the people in the Holy Lands and this exercise has curbed the issue of abscondment and unruly conduct of pilgrims.
