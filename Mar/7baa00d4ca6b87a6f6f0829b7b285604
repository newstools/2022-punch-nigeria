Former Big Brother Naija Lockdown finalist, Vee Iye, on Tuesday announced the death of her grandfather, as she shared his picture on her Instagram story. The fourth runner up for the BBNaija season five wrote that she’d miss her grandfather, adding that she wished they had spent much time together. Describing her grandfather as her favourite man, Vee noted that she won’t be sad because she was certain that the deceased was in heaven. She wrote, “My favourite man. I’m not said because heaven is your home now. I wish we had more time together. I’m gonna miss you so much granddad.” The singer, however, did not state the date of death or the age of the deceased, neither did she state if he was her paternal/maternal grandfather. Born Victoria Adeleye, the reality TV star was born and raised in London but moved to Lagos shortly before she participated in the BBNaija season five edition. As a contestant last year, Vee fought her way to become one of the finalists. However, she was the first to be evicted on the final show, making her the fourth runner-up amongst the top five finalists. For the season, Lekan ‘Laycon’ Agbeleshe emerged as the winner with Dorathy Banchor as the second runner-up. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
