Nigerian rapper, Oladotun Alade, professionally known as Dotman, is seeking to start a conversion as regards abuse faced by men in society. The Akube singer stated via his Twitter page on Saturday that asides facing abuse, men were also not allowed to “process the pain and stress” that came with the traumatizing experiences. In his words, “Abuse against men is really something, even though it’s rarely highlighted. Like even from society POV[Point of View], men are not even allowed the space to process the pain and stress. “You go dey hear ‘be a man’. As much as this phrase may sound uplifting and encouraging, it is destructive.” The rapper who is gearing to release a new EP revealed that he intends to get people talking about the issue by highlighting same in his upcoming project. “As a man and artist who has seen these things from verbal abuse to other types, I just feel like I should use my music to highlight it sometimes. E no easy but I’ll start that convo with my next EP, “The first track is ‘Star Life’ and I use it to speak for men that have been told to ‘be a man’. I’ll try to shatter some biases that never really favored men. Strength to all the men going through it,” he wrote Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
