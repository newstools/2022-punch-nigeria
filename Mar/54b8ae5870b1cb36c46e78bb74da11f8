THE Lagos State Government has said it has partnered with the Nigerian Insurers Association to enforce a compulsory digital building insurance for residents in the state. The Director General, Lagos State Safety Commission, Mr Lanre Mojola, disclosed this on Monday during a press conference in Alausa, Ikeja. He said, “Data show that there have been over 480 building collapses in the last 44 years and this is highlighting the importance of insurance because when dangerous occurrences and disasters happen, the citizenry look up to the government for compensation. “The Lagos State government will continue to step up to its responsibility in ensuring that everyone is protected in the state. To achieve this, a compulsory digital occupiers liability building insurance platform will be introduced for all property owners in line with Section 65 of the Insurance Act 2003 which stipulates that public buildings must be adequately insured and ostensibly to cushion the impact and reduce burden and liability on property owners and government.” The Chief Executive Officer of NIA, Mrs Yetunde Ilori, said residents would be sensitised to the benefits of digital compulsory insurance before its enforcement. “The first stage is to create awareness on the benefits of the digital compulsory insurance because many people do not imbibe the culture of insurance. “After engagement and education, the next stage will be to enforce the law and we will work with the Lagos State government to ensure that all arms of insurance companies key into this,” she said.
