Former tennis world number one Novak Djokovic will not play at the ATP Masters event in Indian Wells, which began on Wednesday. This is because he is not allowed to travel to the U.S. without a coronavirus vaccination. Djokovic said on Twitter that he would also miss the following Miami Open. “While I was automatically listed in the @BNPPARIBASOPEN and @MiamiOpen draw I knew it would be unlikely I’d be able to travel,” he said. “The CDC (Centre for Disease Control) has confirmed that regulations won’t be changing so I won’t be able to play in the US. Good luck to those playing in these great tournaments.” Djokovic gave an interview last month in which he said he was still not vaccinated against the coronavirus. That was after he was deported from Austriala prior to the Australian Open at the start of the year. The Serbian 20-time grand slam major champion was seeded two in Indian Wells in the initial draw but will now be replaced by Bulgaria’s Grigor Dimitrov. In days before the event which opened Wednesday, organisers said they were in discussion with Djokovic’s team. They added it was unclear if he would be allowed to travel to the U.S. under current rules. Djokovic’s only tournament this year has been in Dubai where only a negative PCR test was needed to play rather than a coronavirus vaccine. How many tournaments he can play this year remains unclear with many nations currently requiring vaccines to enter and events unable to secure exemptions for players. However, as the pandemic is easing restrictions are also being lifted which could lead to Djokovic being allowed to travel more freely as the year progresses. (dpa/NAN)
