A frontline governorship aspirant in Ebonyi State on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Dr Elias Igwe, has applauded the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee on the efforts so far made by the committee in the preparation for the national convention of the party billed for tomorrow. A statement released by Igwe on Thursday said he was highly optimistic that the convention would be hitch-free and successful, adding that those expecting the implosion of the APC after the convention would be shocked and disappointed. According to him, “With what is in place so far in terms of the preparations, I have no doubt, the convention will be a huge success. I have keenly monitored the preparations by Governor Mai Mala Buni-led APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee, ahead of the convention scheduled for Saturday, March 26, 2022, and wish to commend the committee very highly for doing a great job. The committee, in my rating, has recorded 80 per cent success. “This imminent success of the convention, no doubt, is going to be a shocker and disappointment to the doomsayers who had predicted that the APC would not be able to hold a successful convention without the party suffering an implosion.” He also lauded the President, Major-General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for the firm and sterling leadership he said the President had shown in ensuring that the APC is united, ahead of the convention. He urged the party leaders to heed the wise counsel of the President, which he said was in the best interest of the party. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
