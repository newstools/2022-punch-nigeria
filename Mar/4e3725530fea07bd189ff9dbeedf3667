Speaking at a press conference in Benin City, Edo State on Monday to announce the release of the results, the Registrar/Chief Executive Officer of NABTEB, Prof. Ifeoma Isiugo-Abanihe, said 23,660 males and 15,133 females enrolled in 1,696 centres across the 36 states and Abuja. She said, “The details of the results of the 2021 November/December NBC/NTC and ANTC examination indicate That 38,793 enrolled for the examinations, while 38,639 candidates sat for the examinations, representing 99.60 per cent of the total enrolment. “The number of credits passes obtained by candidates for purposes of academic and work progression revealed that 76.30 per cent of the total number of candidates, which is 25,915 candidates, obtained five credits and above, including English Language and Mathematics. “Also, 88.1 per cent (29,923 candidates) scored five credits and above with or without English Language and Mathematics. “A total of 33,965 candidates sat for the Ordinary Level certificate examinations and 4,674 candidates sat for Advanced Level. Similarly, out of 6,462 candidates that sat for various Trades at all levels, 3,352 candidates, representing 57.87 per cent, were certified as craftsmen. “For the Advanced Level examinations, 1,871 candidates, representing 40.02% of the 4,674 candidates that sat for various Trades at Master Craft level were certified as Master Craftsmen. The result statistics represent a slight decrease in performance over those of 2020 November/December certificate examinations.” She said that the board has among other challenges, the public stigmatisation against Technical and Vocational Educational Training, inadequate funding of TVET programmes and institutions such as NABTEB and gross imbalance between number of technical colleges and conventional secondary schools, which leads to low enrolment.
