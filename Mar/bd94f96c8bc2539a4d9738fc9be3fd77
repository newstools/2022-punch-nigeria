Residents of Aleyita, Lugbe, in the Federal Capital Territory, on Sunday, repelled an attack on the community by suspected robbers, apprehending three of the suspects. PUNCH Metro gathered that the hoodlums were about 15 and fled when residents joined forces and confronted the gang. Last week, a gang of robbers invaded Chika Phase 3, an adjoining street, and dispossessed residents of their mobile phones, television sets, cash, among others. A resident of Aleyita, Hakeem Azeez, said that incident made them to be on the alert. According to him, one of the suspects died while engaging residents in a fight. He said, ‘’They came around 6am and were jumping from one house to the other. It was like a movie, as one of them was walking on people’s roofs. ‘’They had robbed the other street last week and carted away phones and other property. We knew they would come again and truly, they did. ‘’One was caught while struggling to go away with some of the things stolen from people. Two others were given a hot chase and apprehended. “One of those they went to rob engaged them; they fled when other residents joined; but one stayed put and tried to fight them, instead of surrendering.  He was, however, overpowered, leading to his death. “I want to plead with the police to investigate properly and apprehend others. The attack on our area is getting out of hand. ‘’ The FCT police spokesperson, Josephine Adeh, promised to get back to our correspondent on the incident. She had yet to do so as of the time of filing this report.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
