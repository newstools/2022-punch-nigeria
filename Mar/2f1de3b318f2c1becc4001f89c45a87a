The Association of Professional Bodies of Nigeria has called on the Federal Government to implement the country’s 2021-2025 National Development Plan. They made the call at the 2022 presidential retreat of the APBN, themed, “National Development Plan: The Role of Professionals”. The event which was held in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, on Thursday, examined government policies as well as professional practices. The keynote speaker of the retreat, Mr. Taiwo Oyedele, stressed that the ABPN, as a key body, had the expertise to help the government to implement the country’s 2021-2025 national development plan. Oyedele also urged the APBN to set an agenda for the implementation of the National Development Plan and make clear positions in policy-making, among other affairs of the country. He said, “I do not see any other platform more appropriate and competent than the APBN to help the government implement the 2021-2025 National Development Plan. “In the plan, Nigeria is planning to spend about N350tn within the next four years which I think is unrealistic. What we need for our economy to develop is not how much the government will spend but good policies and APBN can help the government formulate and implement good policies”. Copyright PUNCH.
