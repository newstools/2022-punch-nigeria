Multiple award-winning Nigerian singer, David Adeleke, popularly known as Davido, has warned critics against talking down on his kids. This is as the Aye crooner took to his Twitter page on Monday evening to lash out at a critic who threw shade at his son, Ifeanyi. The Twitter user had faulted the singer for using his son’s face for his A Better Time album. The tweep stated that the singer had “stained” the child with the “disaster” he called an album. “Using Peruzzi’s child as an album cover doesn’t guarantee success. Low-key e don stain that little boy white with that disaster he called an album,” read the tweet. Though the tweet mentioned Peruzzi, one of Davido’s aides, it was clear that he was referring to Davido who used his son for his album’s cover. In response, Davido said, “Dead man walking! You have carried your hate for me to my child! Innocent child! Brother, you do this one! Oya na.” Warning critics, Davido said, “Say all you want about DAVIDO but DO NOT MENTION MY CHILDREN.” This comes four days after the singer expressed his obsession with his children. The superstar revealed this in a tweet on Thursday, where he simply wrote, “I’m obsessed with my children.” Davido has always flaunted his three children (Imade, Hailey, and Ifeanyi) on his social media pages and they were also present at his just-concluded London concert at O2 Arena.
