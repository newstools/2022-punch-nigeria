The Lagos State House of Assembly has there should not be any contention over the steps being taken by the State Government following the crisis currently rocking the National Union of Road Transport Workers. Chairman of the House Committee on Transportation, Temitope Adewale, who made the position of the Assembly known, said the legislative arm had been very proactive as it already passed a law creating the Lagos State Parking Authority, which should now oversee activities at all the parks in the State. “The House is fully aware of developments in the transportation union and now that the crisis has resulted in the banning of NURTW activities in Lagos, it is clear to state that all parks, garages and parking activities will be under the Lagos State Parking Authority as stipulated by law,” he said. “At the stage the NURTW has found itself, the State has to take charge of the situation to avoid a breakdown of law and order. “By law, the state’s Parking Authority has a General Manager on whose shoulders the responsibility now falls to manage the parks at the moment. “The law approves a General Manager for the Parking Authority. Lagosians should be calm. The situation is under control as the government takes necessary actions,” he added in a statement. The Lagos State Government had, late Thursday, announced the suspension of all NURTW activities in the State. The government has also denied appointing the suspended chairman of the NURTW, Musiliu Akinsanya, alias MC Oluomo, as General Manager of Lagos Transport Parks and Garages Committee. Copyright PUNCH.
