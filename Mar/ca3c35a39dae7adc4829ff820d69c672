The Permanent Secretary and Accountant-General of the Lagos State Treasury Office, Dr Muritala Abiodun, has urged directors of finance and accounts within the employment of the state government to make themselves relevant. Abiodun, according to a statement on Wednesday, said this during the 2022 first quarter meeting with all directors and heads of finance and accounts departments in Alausa, Ikeja. He said, “I want to urge the directors and heads of finance and accounts departments to make themselves relevant in their respective Ministries, Departments and Agencies such that it will be difficult to make important decisions that affect their organisations without their inputs. “There is the need for accountants to be thorough in the discharge of their duties and I plead with my colleagues to always ensure that the younger finance and accounts officers are adequately supervised in carrying out their assigned schedule.” The Accountant-General also advised officers to insist on due processes in the discharge of their duties. “We must always insist on adherence to provisions of financial regulations while presenting necessary supporting documents to vouchers for speedy processing of approvals and always counsel your principals about the implications of following due process. “The state treasury office is committed to periodic training of officers on the use of Oracle software for effective and efficient processing of financial transactions,” he said.
