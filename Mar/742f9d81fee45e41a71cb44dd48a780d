The Presidential Amnesty Programme has said no amount of blackmail would stop the scheme from empowering ex-agitators in the Niger Delta region. The Interim Administrator of PAP, Col. Milland Dikio (retd.), who stated this in a statement he personally signed said its mandate was to ensure verifiable empowerment of all beneficiaries. Dikio in the statement made available to our correspondent in Port Harcourt said the amnesty office would not allow anything or anyone to distract it from achieving the task. He said the empowerment would be achieved through the PAP’s Train, Employ and Mentor scheme, formation of cooperatives, business clusters, vocational and allied training programmes. “The Presidential Amnesty Programme is committed to ensuring the verifiable empowerment of the ex-agitators in all ramifications to fulfil the mandate and purpose of the programme,” he stated. Dikio said the goal was to attain food security and full participation in the blue economy and urged members of the public to respect PAP’s priorities. The amnesty administrator further said no form of distraction would prevent PAP from achieving its mandate.
