The Abuja Division of the Federal High Court has ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to issue a certificate of return to Stephen Ntukekpo as the Akwa Ibom State Chairman of the All Progressive Congress. Consequently, the court sacked the Augustine Ekanem-led executives of the party and ordered INEC to withdraw the certificate of return issued to them. Justice Taiwo Taiwo, in his judgment, held that the inauguration of the Ekanem-led state executives of the party was an act of illegality. In their stead, the court also ordered the electoral body to issue a certificate of return to Uduakobong Udoh and Uko Ini as the state Secretary and woman leader of the state chapter of the APC respectively. Justice Taiwo Taiwo made the declaratory orders while delivering judgment in the suit brought against the party, members of the National Caretaker Committee and INEC. Justice Taiwo in his judgment declared the plaintiffs as the duly and democratically elected State Executive Committee officers of the party in Akwa Ibom state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
