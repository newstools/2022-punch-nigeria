The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has hosted the founding fathers of the All Progressives Congress, including former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu, to a dinner at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Thursday. The News Agency of Nigeria gathered that the get-together was  to show Buhari’s appreciation to the critical stakeholders for their continued support, understanding and cooperation to his administration. It was also meant to show appreciation to the founding fathers for keeping faith with the goals and ideals of the ruling party for national salvation. The engagement was also in furtherance of genuine efforts by the Buhari administration aimed at ensuring a rancour free and successful National Convention of the party, slated for March 26. Others in attendance included the first Interim Chairman of Party, Chief Bisi Akande, Dr Ogbomnaya Onu, Rochas Okorocha, Ibrahim Shekarau and Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko. Others are Governors Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna, Aminu Masari of Katsina, and Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi.
