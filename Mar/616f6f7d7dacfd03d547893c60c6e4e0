A businesswoman, Mrs Vera Okoroma, on Thursday, broke down in tears in court as the presiding Judge Labaran Gusau adjourned her divorce suit until May 3, for a report of settlement or hearing. The judge advised the couple to explore all avenues of settlement for the sake of the children of the marriage. The petitioner begged the court to grant her a short adjournment. ”I can not live under the same roof with this man, anymore, he and his family have ganged up against me “He threatens my life saying that he can do anything to me and get away with it. “I am no longer safe in that house.” She said crying. She also alleged that her husband called the police to arrest her for doing nothing. (NAN)
