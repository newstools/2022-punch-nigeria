The second batch of Nigerian evacuees from Ukraine has arrived in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory. They arrived at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport, at 6:35 pm on Friday on an Air Peace flight. The 181 evacuees arrived from Poland. The stranded Nigerians were evacuated to Nigeria following the intervention of the Federal Government with the cooperation of governments of countries neighbouring Ukraine. According to Gabriel Aduda, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Federal Government has made all necessary arrangements to ensure that no Nigerian is left stranded in any of the countries where they have fled to. Aduda said that Nigerian airlines – Air Peace and Air Max – would transport stranded Nigerians from Romania, Hungary, and Poland. The Federal Government gave all returnees from Ukraine $100 (about N48,000) to ameliorate their sufferings. This is contained in a statement by Mr Abdur-Rahman Balogun, the Head of Media and Public Relations, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, Abuja. The first batch of 450 Nigerians stranded in Ukraine returned home from Romania through the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. Balogun said that the returnees, mostly students, arrived in Nigeria with Max Air flight 747 at 7:10 a.m. He, however, said that the evacuees from Poland could not return on Thursday because their flight was rescheduled for Friday. He added that Air Peace left on Thursday to pick the passengers from Hungary. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
