Tragedy struck on Tuesday when a truck collided with a Mercedes Benz near Akala Park along the Ogwashi Uku-Kwale Expressway, Delta State, killing six youths. An eyewitness told our correspondent that the accident occurred around 4am. “The young boys and girls were in a new Mercedes Benz; they were between 20 and 25 years of age. “The corpses were deposited in the general hospital’s morgue in Ogwashi Uku, headquarters of Aniocha South LGA of the state,” the witness added. The Delta State Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Ibrahim Abubakar, confirmed the accident. He said, “The victims were three adult males and three females. The two vehicles scattered in pieces and it was difficult identifying the victims as a result of the impact of the collision. “We couldn’t find the registration numbers of the two vehicles; either people took them away or because of the impact; we couldn’t just locate them. “Two of the victims were trapped under the truck and it took our men hectic time to push out the truck before we could bring them out dead.” Abubakar advised motorists, especially those with sight issues, to avoid driving at night. He also cautioned against speeding.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
