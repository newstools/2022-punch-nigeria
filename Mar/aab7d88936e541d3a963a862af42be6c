The Anambra State Governor, Chukwuma Soludo, has apologised to all Anambra people, friends, and guests who attended his inauguration for the momentary breach of protocol that happened during the event. In a statement on Thursday, the media aide to Soludo, Joe Anatune, said the breach was caused by improper communication which arose from a personal issue between the two parties involved. According to him, the breach which disrupted proceedings at the event happened after the wife of the former governor, Ebelechukwu Obiano, approached Mrs Bianca Ojukwu and muttered some words that led to fisticuffs. “Sadly, the fight took the shine off the main event of the day,” the statement read in part. Soludo said steps were being taken to resolve the misunderstanding and restore the parties to their previous relationship. “Anambra State has over the years been  known for a huge stock of social harmony, and the stock will increase substantially in the years ahead as part of the concerted effort to accelerate the state’s development,” he added Copyright PUNCH.
