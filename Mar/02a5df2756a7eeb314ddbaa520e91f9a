General Katunku Gora (retd.) has officially declared his intention to contest for the Zango/Jaba Federal Constituency seat on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, ahead of the 2023 general elections. The ex-army chief disclosed this at the party secretariat in Zonkwa, the headquarters of the Zango Kataf and Jaba Local Government Areas of Kaduna State, respectively, on Monday. Katunku also used the occasion to visit some Internally Displaced Persons Camps where he donated relief materials. He, however, charged the victims to stand firm and trust God that their present situation would soon be over. While reeling out his campaign plans, he reiterated his determination to ensure fairness and justice, adding that’’ issues of majority and minority would be addressed.’ Copyright PUNCH.
