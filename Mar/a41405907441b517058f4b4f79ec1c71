The Society of Women in Taxation has urged professional women in the country to embrace unity and put in their best towards the development of the country. A statement said the group made the call at its first international professional conference that held in Cotonou, Republic of Benin with the theme,  ‘The role of professional women in nation building’. Speaking at the three-day conference, Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerians In Diaspora Commission, Abike Dabiri-Erewa,  advised women against being discouraged by the limitations that the society has confronted them with, but should strive to rise above challenges to be able to effect positive changes in the society. She said that the task of nation building required everyone’s participation, and that women should be given an edge in decision making because of their peculiarities. “Women constitute an indispensable force in the quest for National development of any nation. In developed nations, women have been able to play this important role. However, in Nigeria, women are still relegated to the background as they lack the educational, economic and political power necessary to actualize their innate potentials.” The President, Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria,  Adesina Adedayo, emphasised the need for  robust investment in women in order to achieve societal growth and  the 2030  agenda for sustainable development. The National Chairperson of SWIT, Ruth Adimula, who described nation building as  aiming towards unification of people to ensure that state remained politically stable and viable, urged women of their role in the course.
