A section of fans in Abuja have called for a Victor Osimhen and Odion Ighalo strike force when Nigeria clash with Ghana in the second leg of their Qatar 2022 World Cup play-off at the 60,000 capacity Moshood Abiola National Stadium in Abuja on Tuesday (today). Ighalo, who returned to the Eagles after a two-year hiatus, has impressed in training, with fans clamouring for the striker to be paired along with Napoli frontman Osimhen. Although there was no spark when both players started in the 1-1 draw against Cape Verde on Ighalo’s return to the squad last October, the fans are optimistic the duo are in top form and can wreak havoc on Ghana’s defence. “I want Eguavoen to try both Osimhen and Ighalo in attack because of their current form. Osimhen can learn a lot from both of them playing together,” a fan Fatima Mohammed told PUNCH Sports Extra. A youth corps member, Lewis Akomolafe, said, “I think if the coach decides to drop Kelechi Iheanacho, then he should play Ighalo along with Osimhen, that will be like a double threat.” Farouk Abdul Rahman added, “The way Osimhen was marked in the first leg affected his play. If Ighalo starts along with him in Abuja, it will be difficult for the Ghanaian defenders to hold both strikers down. I think if they focus more on Osimhen, then Ighalo will shine. If they hold both of them, then the wingers will shine, so, I think it’s a win-win with an Osimhen and Ighalo partnership.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
