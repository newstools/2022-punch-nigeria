President of the Nigerian community in the Asante Region of Ghana, which includes Kumasi, Okafor Chukwudi, says they are fully prepared to give the Super Eagles the desired support on Friday (today) when the Eagles play Ghana in their 2022 World Cup play-off first leg in Kumasi. Chukwudi told thenff.com that the community was ready to swarm Ghana’s second largest city to cheer the Eagles to victory at the Baba Yara Stadium. “We are fully mobilised. We have been working in tandem with the Nigeria High Commission and we will storm the stadium in great numbers,” Okafor said, while receiving the Eagles on arrival in Kumasi on Thursday. The contingent was led by President, Nigeria Football Federation, Amaju Pinnick, with some members of NFF Executive Committee, the NFF General Secretary, some members of NFF management and staff, parliamentarians, stakeholders and media representatives. Eagles technical adviser Austin Eguavoen led the coaching and administrative staff of the team, while captain Ahmed Musa was at the head of the 25-man playing body. Copyright PUNCH.
