American reality TV star, Kylie Jenner, has lamented the difficulty of her postpartum journey six weeks after the birth of her second child. On Tuesday, the Keeping Up With The Kardashian star posted a video of herself working out, as she revealed that recovering from the birth of her son has been more difficult than her first experience. “I just want to say to all my postpartum mums that postpartum has not been easy. It’s not been easy, it’s very hard. This experience for me personally has been a little harder than with my daughter. “It’s not easy mentally, physically, spiritually, it’s just crazy, and I want to get back to life without saying that,” she said. The mother-of-two also advised mothers to avoid being influenced by glamorous depictions of childbirth and the recovery process on the Internet, and instead take it easy on themselves. She said, “We might go on the Internet and it might look easy on other people and this might put pressure on us. But it’s okay not to be okay. I keep putting pressure on myself and I just keep reminding myself I made a whole human, a beautiful healthy boy. “We have to stop putting pressure on ourselves to ‘be back’ not just physically but mentally after birth.” Jenner welcomed her son, Wolf, with rapper, Travis Scott in February. The couple also shares a four-year-old daughter, Stormi. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
