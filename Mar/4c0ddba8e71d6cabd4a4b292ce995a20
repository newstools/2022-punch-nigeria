Fidelis Ilechukwu, head coach of Nigeria Professional Football League side, Plateau United, is delighted with the improvement in the league with the 2021/22 season almost mid-way, The PUNCH reports. In the past, coaches, players and fans alike have complained about the standard of the league, poor officiating and attacks on away teams. So far, the 2021/22 NPFL season has recorded few cases of such with teams winning games away from home, this much to the delight of the former Heartland FC coach. Speaking with The PUNCH, Ilechukwu said he was delighted to have seen some improvement in the league and commended the League Management Company. “The NPFL is now one of the best leagues in Africa and far better compared to what it used to be,” Ilechukwu told The PUNCH. “Officiating is very open to everybody and when you are well prepared; you can win anywhere, which means teams are very positive playing both home and away. “So far this season, officiating in the league has been the best I’ve seen, things are really different right now and even when you are playing away from home you stand a chance of winning. This also allows players to express themselves very well.” Plateau United, who currently sit second on the log with 37 points from 17 matches, will travel to Aba as they face Enyimba FC on match-day 18 of the NPFL.
