ACCORDING to Italian publication, Corriere della Sera, Nigeria international Victor Osimhen is being overpriced by Napoli, a strategy by the Italian club to wade off suitors, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Osimhen has been linked with a move away from Napoli, having spent just two seasons with the Parthenopeans following his record €81m move from Lille in the summer of 2020. English Premier League duo Manchester United and Newcastle United are believed to be leading the race to sign the striker next summer, with Real Madrid, Liverpool and Arsenal also having reportedly shown interest in the 23-year-old striker. In a bid to push away clubs from snatching their most priced player, Napoli chief De Laurentiis placed a hefty €100m on the Nigerian; €20m more than what it cost the club to sign the striker from France two years ago. Corriere della Sera stated that Osimhen is been overpriced by Napoli. “His value is €60m and remains today the same as it was two years ago, when he was taken over from Lille, but there are those from England who goes further to make sure De Laurentiis raises to €100,” the website wrote. “Too much? It is certainly a strategy to lock the centre forward of the future.” Despite being plagued by injury this season, Osimhen has scored 11 goals and registered four assists in 22 appearances across all competitions.
