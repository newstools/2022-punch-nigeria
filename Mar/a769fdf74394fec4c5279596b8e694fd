The Association of Motor Dealers of Nigeria has said the Vehicle Identification Number system introduced by the Nigeria Customs Service for imported vehicles may increase the number of illegally imported cars into the nation. This was disclosed by the National President of the association, Metche Nnadiekwe, during a press briefing. He added that the policy was fraudulent and threatened legal action if the policy is not suspended. According to him, the policy is likely to make life unbearable for Nigerians, and destroy the gains recorded in the transportation sector in recent times. Nnadiekwe added that using the VIN Valuation contravenes the Customs and Excise Management Act 20 of 2003 which explains transaction value (purchase price) as the price agreed between a seller and buyer. He said, “We therefore demand the immediate suspension of the VIN valuation system designed by Customs and review of the same in consideration of the Nigeria Customs act. “We also demand investigation and prosecution of those involved in this fraud, which has caused panic and destabilization of businesses at Nigerian ports. “The NCS are witness to the fact that members of AMDON have been supportive of all government policies that would eradicate smuggling of used vehicles, as we have demonstrated in all our meetings with the Customs management and we have always pledged our support to the NCS in every area that would bring development to the country.” According to him, it is impossible for vehicles that come from different countries and arrive at the ports to have the same value considering the different commercial level and freight costs  Copyright PUNCH.
