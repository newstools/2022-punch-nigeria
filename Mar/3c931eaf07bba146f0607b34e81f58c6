Congress of University Academics in Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, has berated the President, Academic Staff Union of Universities, Professor Emmanuel Osodeke, for attacking the university’s outgoing Vice Chancellor, Prof. Eyitope Ogunbodede, who he referred to as a member of an unregistered union. A statement signed by CONUA’s National Coordinator, Dr. Niyi Sunmonu, obtained in Osogbo on Tuesday, said that the ASUU President wrongly claimed that CONUA assisted Ogunbodede to become VC in 2017, while the group was not formed in OAU until 2018. The statement read in parts, “Prof. Osodeke’s vituperations on Prof. Ogunbodede being a member of CONUA is uncalled for and it is laughable. As a professor and supposed activist, he should know that the formation of an association is a prerequisite for its registration and not vice versa. “Saying that Prof Ogunbodede claims to be a member of an association which is yet to be registered is a personification of ignorance on the part of Prof. Osodeke as far as labour law is concerned in Nigeria. For his information, there are associations in Nigeria that have filed in their registration documents but are fully recognised by the government. CONUA is one of these associations. “Lastly, since the emergence of CONUA, Prof Osodeke has never been comfortable because he could see freedom coming the ways of academics in Nigerian universities. “He is afraid of CONUA’s bold steps in confronting the evil effects of strikes in our universities; hence, he is bent on attacking CONUA at every opportunity.” CONUA then advised Osodeke to always mind his business in ASUU without poke nosing into the affairs of CONUA.
