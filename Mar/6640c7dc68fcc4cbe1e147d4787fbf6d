A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in Ogun East Senatorial District, Mr Segun Senbanjo, has said achieving good governance through improved healthcare, education, security and empowerment of the people is a priority. Speaking during a familiarisation visit to Ijebu Ode, Ijebu North and Odogbolu, said this could only be achieved if the people of Ogun  State continued to support the ‘Building Our Future Together Agenda’ of Governor Dapo Abiodun. He said, “My passion is solely driven by the progress and prosperity of the indigenes of Ogun state and Nigerians as a whole. Politics is secondary. “I want to see how we continue to improve in aspects of education, health and agriculture, investment and I believe the Governor will continue to do what is best for our great party and people of Ogun state.” He explained that the efforts of Abiodun must be given continuity if Ogun East and the entire Ogun State still wanted to enjoy the dividends of democracy and service delivery. Senbanjo assured the people that other areas yet untouched by the present administration would be attended to as soon as possible. “I am back at home to get involved, to be a middle man between you and top-level authorities both at the state and federal level. I am a son of the soil like you all, and indeed we must continue to support our Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun who has made all of us proud, as an Ijebu Remo man. “Ijebu Ode and indeed, Ogun State is wearing a new look courtesy of him; this we must reciprocate by supporting his continuity as our governor come 2023.″ In their different responses, the ward members eulogised Senbanjo for visiting his ward before visiting other wards and local government areas.
