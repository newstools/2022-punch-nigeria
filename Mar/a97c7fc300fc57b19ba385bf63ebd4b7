The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, has barred all police officers from carrying out certain security operations on mufti. This was disclosed by the Force Acting Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, in a series of tweets on Friday. According to Adejobi, the operations which the officers must not perform without putting on approved uniforms include stop and search at checkpoints, and also patrol duties. He wrote, “Ladies and gentlemen, we commend you for ur understanding and support at all times. The IGP has ordered that every policeman standing on the road for stop and search, checkpoint, or/and patrol duties must be on approved uniform for easy identification and authority. “Every police uniform must bear name and force number for other ranks. We have taken this step to sanitise our operational engagements and have better human relations. Thanks. MUYIWA Adejobi, Ag. Force Public Relations Officer, Force Headquarters, Abuja.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
