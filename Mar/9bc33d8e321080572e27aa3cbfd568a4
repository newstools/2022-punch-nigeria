Benue State Government on Monday sacked the management team of Lobi Stars Football Club. Chairman of the Club and Deputy Governor of the state, Benson Abounu, said that the club Vice Chairman, Tama Aondofa, and the entire management team of the club have been sacked. The team Technical Adviser, Eddy Doumbraye, was last week relieved of his duty. Abounu, who announced the sack of the team management in his office, explained that the action became expedient to reposition the team and save it from being relegated to the lower division. The Deputy Governor decried the poor performance of Tama’s management in less than one year as administrator of the club. “There were recent changes that brought Tama on board but in less than one year the club is going down the drain. We have done everything to bring it back. He asked for certain things to improve on the club yet to no avail. I and the Governor were disturbed when the club was in the 13th position. “We called him (Tama) and he promised to make certain changes and lift the club back. He fired the Technical Adviser he brought and made a few changes in the management of the team. “We are in the 19th position and this is dangerous and if we allow things this way, it will be embarrassing. After due consideration with all stakeholders including the governor, we asked for Tama’s resignation which he gave us a few minutes ago. The entire management is dissolved; new management will be constituted to save the club from relegation. “After due consideration, we decided that Dominic Iorfa who has vast experience in football management and administration be appointed as Vice Chairman. His knowledge will be useful to save the club,” Abounu said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
