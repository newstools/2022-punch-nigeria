Abdullahi said this in Abuja during a two-day workshop on ‘Corporate communication and strategic information management, for NBAIS officers, which was organised in collaboration with Clanfield Communications Limited. “We have not less than 1,600 schools across the country sitting for our examinations and same time we plan to convince the government to give us recognition, approval to operate nationally,” he said. He said, “We have workers on ICT, most of them are new because the board started recently. So, we need to educate our people on that area, that is why we organised the workshop.” We have a unique and national curriculum for Arabic and Islamic schools.” The Managing Partner, Clanfield Communication Limited, Iheoma Shedrach, said that information management was important to the NBAIS board in the discharge of their responsibilities and achieving their mandates.
