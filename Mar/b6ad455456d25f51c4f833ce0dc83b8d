The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control has called for an end to the indiscriminate use of controlled medicines. The Director-General of NAFDAC, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, at the unveiling of the International Narcotics Control Board Annual Report and Precursors in Lagos also called for a combative effort in tackling the menace of drug abuse in the country. Adeyeye was represented at the event by the agency’s Director of Drug Evaluation and Research, Mrs Ijeoma Nwankwo. She said, “Although controlled medicines are indispensable in the treatment of pain and are central to achieving universal health coverage, they can be used in ways that are not appropriate and cause dependence. “Narcotics and psychotropic substances are indispensable for the relief of pain and suffering. Controlled medicines possess abuse liability and produce dependence in users and are classified based on medical utility and potential for abuse. “The report being presented today gives insight into the global situation with regards to controlled medicines and provides effective strategies to managing our health care services as well as drug use situations.” According to Wikipedia, “a controlled substance is generally a drug or chemical whose manufacture, possession and use is regulated by a government, such as illicitly used drugs or prescription medications that are designated by law.”
