Thirty-five-year-old Nigerian IT security expert, Mr Ukpong Daniel, has said his top priority remains the creation of jobs and tackling insecurity if elected as the country’s president in 2023. Daniel who has indicated his intention to contest the 2023 presidential election under the platform of the People’s Democratic Party said this at a briefing in Lagos on Sunday. He solicited the support of well-meaning in his bid to find solutions to the problems of the country. “I am deeply convinced that it is time for us to fix Nigeria and get it working. No sincere citizen of this country including those in power would say this Nation is a working environment and go to sleep with two eyes closed. “All well-meaning citizens both home and in the Diaspora should for the good of this Nation, put in everything and do all they must to give us a chance to fix this Land. Yes, many are out seeking to sit in that office for reasons only their hearts know. However, there is the saying that the lesser is included in the greater and lesser lights always bows to greater lights. Our plans are surely the best way out. “As the new hope, we will establish tens of millions of jobs, wipe off insecurities, give room for best brains and overhaul our educational system to produce experts to drive for global best practices. Ours will be high technological advancement, medical and pharmaceutical explorations, standard costing and trading policies, infrastructural boom and accountable governance. It is time for Nigeria to produce for the whole world and not keep taking from other nations” Daniel said. He added that it was unfortunate that the old political class had only records of promising heaven and earth just to suit the ears of the masses but entirely turn to predators and dictators when elected.
