United States President Joe Biden laid out to Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, on Friday the “consequences” of any backing for Russia in its war against Ukraine. The White House gave this warning as Beijing showed no sign of joining Western condemnation of Russia’s invasion. The comments came during a nearly two-hour phone call between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies, which touched on Ukraine, Taiwan and their own relationship. Biden described the implications and consequences if China provided material support to Russia as it conducted brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians. Chinese state television reported that Xi said the war was “in no one’s interest” and that “state-to-state relations cannot go to the stage of military hostilities.” However, there was no direct criticism of the Kremlin and a readout from the Chinese foreign ministry quoted Xi saying “all sides” needed to support “dialogue” between Russia and Ukraine. Xi had also appeared to put some responsibility for Russia’s invasion of its neighbour on the West. He said, “the United States and the North Treaty Organisation should have dialogued with Russia to address the crux of the Ukraine crisis and ease security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine.” The Chinese leader had consistently refused to condemn his fellow authoritarian ally, President Vladimir Putin, over the Ukrainian invasion.
