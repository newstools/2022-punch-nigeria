The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has said the nation’s present budgeting system is fraudulent and needs overhauling. According to him, the nation needs a more transparent and accountable budgeting system. He disclosed this on Monday while addressing participants at a four-day training organised by the Edo State Ministry of Budget and Economic Planning, in collaboration with Open Government Partnership. He said, “One of the major crises that we have in Nigeria today, apart from the very weak bureaucracy, is our budgeting process. Our budgeting is almost fraudulent. “As an entity, whether federal, state, or local government, must know how much it can earn. Assuming you can only earn N100 in a year with all the evidence right before you, of course, you know it’s going to be N100. “By the time you are preparing the budget and you are giving certain agencies envelopes to put this and that in the budget, you will end up putting up a budget of N200, and you are only going to receive N100. That is where the fraud begins. According to Obaseki, because the government has to pay salaries before it does anything, the buck of its budget would continue to go into servicing salaries, leaving little or nothing for projects that will affect the people and boost development.
