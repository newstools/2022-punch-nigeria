The Ghana Football Association has confirmed that the Confederation of African Football has granted its appeal to have the Qatar 2022 World Cup play-off between the Black Stars and the Super Eagles played in a capacity filled Baba Yara Stadium. According to a statement from the GFA website, Africa’s football governing body consented to their request following its assurances that it will follow laid down rules. Ghana host Nigeria in the first leg of the double-header clash in Kumasi today, with the return leg billed for the Moshood Abiola National Stadium in Abuja four days later. The Baba Yara Stadium became the match venue after CAF rejected Cape Coast Stadium. Bearing in mind the magnitude of the encounter, GFA made a request to have the 40,000 capacity stadium filled up to have the support of the home crowd. “The Confederation of African Football has approved Ghana’s request to admit 40,000 spectators for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 play-off first leg match against Nigeria at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi,” a statement from the GFA website read. “This comes after the Ghana Football Association request to play the game in a full capacity stadium following the laid-down rules by CAF. “The GFA consequently advise all Ghanaians to obey all laid-down safety and security measures strictly to first and foremost have a successful match and also to avoid any sanctions from CAF and FIFA. “Meanwhile, fans are advised to strictly adhere to the designated spectators and stakeholders entry points and gates for verification of their tickets.” Copyright PUNCH.
