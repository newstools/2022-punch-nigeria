Canada announced on Thursday that it was establishing a new immigration program that would offer Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion a temporary Canadian residence permit for up to three years. Canada, which had a large Ukrainian diaspora, especially in the centre and west of the country, said in a statement, “Ukrainians and their immediate family members of any nationality may stay in Canada as temporary residents for up to three years.” Applicants would be required to apply online and provide their biometric data in the form of fingerprints and a photo. The Ukrainian refugees could simultaneously apply for a work and study permit as well. Ukrainians and their families already settled on Canadian soil would also benefit from the new measures and could extend their visitor status or work permit for three years. Canada said that it would also allow them to apply for a new work or study permit, or extend their existing permit. According to a United Nations count released on Thursday, more than three million people have fled Ukraine since the start of the deadly Russian invasion on February 24.  More than half of these people are said to have taken refuge in Poland.
