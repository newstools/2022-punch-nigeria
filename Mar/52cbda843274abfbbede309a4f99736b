Arewa Young Professionals at the end of its meeting in Kano backed the emergence of their principal, Senator George Akume, as the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress. As a progressively democratic entity, the APC group maintained that they would always be on the side of truth, transparency and equality In a statement by the convener, Al Hassan Adamu, Abdullahi Adamu and Mohammed A Kabir, all co-conveners, said the purported endorsement of Senator Abdullahi Adamu by the President, totally negated the spirit of inclusiveness, adding that those conversant with happenings in meetings, noted that there is no such time the President made such a claim. The group maintained that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), is a true democrat, stressing that he would never indulge in undemocratic practices. The statement read in part, “The news report of an endorsement was a kite flown to disorganise and dissuade other aspirants from pursuing their ambition. “Where we agree, a consensus is embedded in the APC constitution, everyone must be carried along. “In order to reduce the tendency of acrimony, elective primaries and contests should be allowed, so every aspirant would test his popularity and acceptability.” The group stated that if an open free and fair elective contest was adopted in the convention, it would be rancour-free, stressing that contenders would accept the outcome and work for the progress of the party. “As the ruling party, we must be guided by our actions, hence must work to deepen democracy and promote internal democracy within the party. “We reiterate our resolve to continue to hold engagement and consultation for the emergence and victory for our principal.” Copyright PUNCH.
