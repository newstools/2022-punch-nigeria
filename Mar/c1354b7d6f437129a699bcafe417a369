An aspirant vying for the office of Governor of Ogun State on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, Ladipupo Adebutu, has said there is no crisis in the state’s chapter of the party. This is as he said he is sure of his victory in the 2023 governorship elections. Adebutu disclosed this to journalists on Thursday at the PDP National Secretariat, Abuja, shortly after obtaining his expression of interest and nomination forms. The governorship hopeful declared that he has served the party faithfully, contributing immensely to its growth even though that earned him considerable political persecution which he claimed to have survived through his good intentions for the party. He affirmed that the main opposition party would regain power in the Ogun with the support of stakeholders, regardless of the odds stacked up against it. Citing the events heralding the Ogun State 2019 election, Adebutu said, “I aspired to serve the people of Ogun State as governor. The party chose me to be the PDP candidate but some people circumvented it and the court stopped me. “But today, Ogun PDP is one and the party is truly united. There is one electoral college and we are approaching the 2023 election as a united front. With a free and fair contest, I believe I shall be the party’s nominee, I shall be the PDP candidate. “I will be able to bring to play the manifesto of the PDP and my personal aspirations and programmes for the people of Ogun State.” Quizzed about the performance of the incumbent governor, Dapo Abiodun, he replied “I don’t want to rate the incumbent. I won’t say they have failed in doing roads, failed in education or health. Rather, I will tell you what the PDP is capable of doing. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
