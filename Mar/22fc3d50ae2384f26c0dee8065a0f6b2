Nigerian UFC featherweight fighter, Sodiq Yusuff, is eying a Top 10 place in his category after moving one step to 11th in the recently released list by the Mixed Martial Arts franchise. Yusuff returned to winning ways with a unanimous decision win over veteran Alex Caceres at UFC Fight Night: Santos versus Ankalaev in Las Vegas on Sunday. Before the fight, he was ranked No.12 but has moved up one step to 11th in the latest rankings released by the UFC after the fight. Yusuff has won six of his seven fights in the UFC with his only loss against British fighter Arnold Allen in April 2021 in Las Vegas. The win over Caceres was his first fight in 11 months, having suffered from COVID-19 complications for a long period. The 28-year-old is however looking forward to making it into the top 10 as he one day hopes to join compatriots Kamaru Usman and Israel Adesanya in becoming a UFC champion. “Now I’m No.11, I’m on my way to being in the Top 10 and I can’t wait,” Yusuff told PUNCH Sport Extra. After his last win, the UFC star indicated his interest in fighting ninth-ranked Bryce Mitchell. “I really want to test myself against Arkansas’ finest,” Yusuff said after his win against Caceres. “I’d really like to fight Bryce Mitchell.” A win for Yusuff will automatically see him join the division’s Top 10 fighters.
