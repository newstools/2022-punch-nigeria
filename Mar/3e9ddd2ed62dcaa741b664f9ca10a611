Gunmen have killed no fewer than three persons in Isuofia in Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State. It was gathered that the incident happened late on Sunday. Isuofia is the hometown of the state governor-elect, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo. According to a voice note obtained by our correspondent on Monday evening, the three persons were killed in a filling station in the community. The voice note, which went viral on Monday evening, called for prayers to save Isuofia and the entire South East. Calls made to the telephone line of the state police spokesman, Ikenga Tochukwu, were not answered and text messages sent to him were not also responded to as of the time of filing this report. However, one of Soludo’s media aides, who did not want his name mentioned, confirmed that the incident happened on Sunday. “Yes, the incident happened on Sunday. About three persons were killed in the attack, the cause of the attack is still not known yet,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
