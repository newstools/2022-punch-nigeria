Aggrieved staff members of the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday held hours-long protest at the headquarters of the commission to communicate their demands which they said the management of the agency has refused to address over time. During the protest, the staff of the commission expressed dismay over issues such as unpaid allowances, delay in the conduct of promotion exercise as well as the appointment of directors in the commission. Other issues raised include allegations that the management has been running an exclusive administration without care for the welfare of the larger number of the staff members. The protest grounded activities at the commission as protesting workers blocked the main entrance to the commission, making it impossible for the management staff and other people on appointments to gain access to the premises. In reaction to the union demands, the commission assured its staff of the agency’s commitment to ensure industrial peace and harmony in the commission. The Executive Commissioner, Corporate Services, SEC, Ibrahim Boyi, gave the assurance while addressing the protesters. He said, “The Board of the Commission is currently meeting to approve the appointment of qualified senior staff as directors and we believe this process will be concluded very soon.” Copyright PUNCH.
