A former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, on Friday declared that there was no zoning arrangement for the governorship seat in the state. Ekweremadu stated this during a media interaction on his intention to contest for the governorship position in Enugu State in the 2023 election. He disclosed that the former governors, including the incumbent governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, were not a product of zoning. Ekweremadu, who hails from Aninri Local Government Area and currently represents Enugu West Senatorial District at the National Assembly, said there was never any discussion concerning zoning of the governorship ticket in the state. “Whoever said that there is anything such as zoning in Enugu State should come out and say where the discussion was held,” he said. He maintained that rather than focus on zoning, it should be a question of who would do the job better. “I challenge anybody who says that there was zoning arrangement to come and say where the discussion and the agreement took place. I was the campaign manager of Senator Chimaroke Nnamani during his first term and he was not a product of zoning. “Sullivan Chime was not a product of zoning and I was not a product of zoning either. If I was, I wouldn’t have been in the Senate for five consecutive terms. “I don’t want to be a zonal governor but the governor of Enugu State. Whoever is talking about zoning has interest and candidates that they want to put in power,” he maintained.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
