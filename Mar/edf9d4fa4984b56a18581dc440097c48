The Russian forces have continued with their bombardment of Ukraine as peace talks continued between both countries. The Associated Press reports that Russia’s military forces blasted Ukraine’s capital region and other major cities, on Wednesday, in an effort to crush a Ukrainian defence that has so far frustrated their progress. Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in what President Vladimir Putin called “special military operations” since three weeks ago. As talks continued, the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, has hinted that a neutral military status for Ukraine was being “seriously discussed,” the AP reports. Commenting on the progress of the peace talks, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has described Russia’s demands for ending the war as becoming “more realistic.” He added that Russian forces had continued their heavy shelling of cities having been unable to move deeper into Ukrainian territory. “Efforts are still needed. Patience is needed,” Zelensky said in a video address to the nation. “Any war ends with an agreement,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
