The Minister of State for Education, Mr Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, has reacted to the ASUU’s declaration of the extension of its industrial strike by two months, saying it had met all the demands of the union. Nwajiuba, who insisted that the Federal Government had met all of the demands of the union, added that all earned allowances as well as revitalisation funds had been released. “ASUU announced and we met and everything that they have demanded, we have done all of them including the earned allowances and the revitalisation fund; they choose to extend it for two months may be,” he said. The PUNCH had earlier reported that ASUU had rolled over its initial one-month strike which ended on March 14, for another two months, having failed to reach a beneficial resolution as regards the outstanding 2009 ASUU/FG Agreement. ASUU had also accused the FG of working against the deployment of the UTAS, a payment platform designed by ASUU in lieu of the IPPIS payment system. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
