A House of Representatives aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, Deji Aboderin, has urged governments at all levels to ensure fairness in the dispensation justice in order to guarantee development and improved standard of living for all Nigerians. Aboderin said this on Tuesday at Christ Primary School, Odinjo, Ibadan while declaring his ambition to run for House of Representatives position for Ibadan South East and North East Federal Constituency. He said, “When you have the right people in government, things would run well and there would be development. Our people should benefit from government. “We need a government that really cares about the people. We don’t deserve a government under which schools are closed down. This thing is ruining the lives of the youth and the future of the nation. “Look at our university system today; there is strike every time and this is killing the system. Look at our primary schools, most of them have nothing to write home about.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
