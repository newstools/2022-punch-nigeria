Former Big Brother Naija Shine Ya Eye finalist, Angel Smith, has gifted her mum, Titi, an iPhone 12 ahead of the latter’s birthday. The reality Tv star announced this on her Instagram story on Friday, where she shared a video of her mum unwrapping the phone. Angel wrote, “I got my mummy an iPhone 12 for her birthday and her excitement is so cute. But let’s just say, she’s about to terrorise y’all on Tiktok. Happy birthday in advance babe.” The excited mum appreciated the 22-year-old writer for the early birthday gift, hailing her as the “best daughter in the world.” Angel’s mum had earlier hinted at receiving a gift from her daughter as she hailed the writer on her Instagram story. “The way this child surprised me today still dey shock me. Birthday gift came too early. Thank you sunshine,” Titi had said on Thursday. She also revealed that she was already receiving gifts though her birthday was on March 29. “My birthday is on the 29th of this month and I’m already getting gifts and birthday messages. Love y’all,” Angel’s mum said on Friday. On Angel’s 22nd birthday last month, her mum had showered her with prayers. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
