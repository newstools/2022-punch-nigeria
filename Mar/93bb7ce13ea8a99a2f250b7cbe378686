Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen won’t say no to Real Madrid if the right offer comes from the Spanish giants, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. According to reports in Italy and Spain, the Nigeria international is seen by Madrid as a Plan B should they fail to land Erling Haaland in the summer, with the Norwegian a transfer interest for several other European clubs, including Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain. Haaland is one of the top targets for the Spanish side, but according to recent reports, they will most likely be going for the striker next summer, after advising him to spend one more season with Borussia Dortmund. Osimhen joined Napoli in the summer of 2020 for an African record price of €81m and has been a revelation for the Naples-based side this campaign, scoring 11 goals in 22 games despite suffering from a facial fracture and COVID-19. Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis has since estimated the Nigerian to be worth €100m, a price Madrid may be unwilling to pay, according to Italian journalist Fabio Santini. Santini has also explained that if Madrid were to make a proposal, Osimhen would not say no, as he sees it as an upgrade on Napoli. The 23-year-old is one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe and has drawn interest from some of the biggest English Premier League sides including Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool amongst other top European sides.
