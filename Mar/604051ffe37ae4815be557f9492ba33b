Pelumi Abegunde, the brother of late BRT passenger, Bamise Ayanwola has revealed that the “vital information” that led to the discovery of the body of the deceased came from social media. He said that the authorities; both the operators of the BRT scheme and police were unhelpful in the search for Bamise. Abegunde reiterated the call for justice and said that if the Lagos State government and all parties involved fail to ensure justice, then God will intervene. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
