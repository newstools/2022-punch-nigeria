For the first time in months, All Progressives Congress National Leader, Bola Tinubu, stepped out together with his wife, Remi, to celebrate his 70th birthday anniversary. Both Tinubu and the Senator representing Lagos Central in the red chamber have not been seen together in public for about a year but the duo stepped out together on Tuesday at Eko Hotels in Lagos, the venue of the 13th Bola Ahmed Tinubu Colloquium with the theme, ‘Pivoting Nigeria Into The New Order’. The former Lagos State governor from 1999 to 2007 and APC presidential aspirant and his wife arrived the venue at about 02:30pm to the rousing applause of dignitaries including governors, traditional rulers, business and political leaders. Since May 2021 when she was involved in a shouting match with some Nigerians at Marriot Hotel in Lagos, venue of a public hearing on constitutional review, Remi has kept off the media glare. Remi has also not been seen with her husband who has been crisscrossing the length and breadth of Nigeria to consult stakeholders ahead of his “lifelong” presidential ambition in 2023.
