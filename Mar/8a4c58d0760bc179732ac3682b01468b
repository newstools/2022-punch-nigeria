A pressure group, Unified Northern Nigeria Youth Forum, has urged the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, to join the 2023 presidential contest. Aliyu Sani, a spokesperson for the group, while briefing journalists on Monday in Jos, said that the call became necessary because Emefiele possessed the capability to turn around the economy of the country for good. “There has been a series of consultations and mass rallies across some states in the North, calling on Emefiele to join the race and contest for the office of president in the 2023 elections. “We are here in Plateau to add to this call and mount this pressure further until we have acceptance from Emefiele. “For any government to succeed and improve economically, it must turn to the CBN for the creation of initiatives and policies deliberately targeting the growth of Gross Domestic Product. “The CBN under the capable leadership of Emefiele introduced policies that led to growth of GDP and created lots of employments in all states of the federation,” he said. The spokesperson noted the Anchor Borrowers Scheme, an initiative of CBN under Emefiele, had impacted positively on the lives of Nigerians including farmers in Plateau. “Since the demise of our founding fathers, no single individual has impacted on improving the lives of the downtrodden, making life better and easier for the Northerners like Godwin Emefiele. “This is why we converge here in Plateau, to identify, consult and crave the indulgence of like-minds to add their voices and meaningful inputs to the call on him to contest for the President of this country. “Let there be no sentiment, Emefiele deserves to be Nigeria’s president more than any other person as he has demonstrated capability in the position he currently occupies,” he said.
