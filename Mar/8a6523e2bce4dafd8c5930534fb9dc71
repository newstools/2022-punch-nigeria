Pan African Women Empowerment Network has announced that it is set to help 100 women to move into the technology ecosystem by the end of 2022. The founder, PAWEN, Oluwaseyi Kehinde-Peters, disclosed this to our correspondent in an interview. According to her, the not-for-profit organisation is ready to use its conference as the launch board to achieve its goal. She said, “We are working with women. We want to help at least 100 women start a career in tech before the end of the year. We have a curriculum, mentors, we have an entire system set up for this. “We are running this in four phases. We are starting with the first phase which is the women in tech conference. The second phase is onboarding and selection. The third phase is where the mentors will come in. Then the final phase is where we would have a virtual career fair where we would invite companies that are going to recruit and also present the ladies we have trained so that we can match them to jobs.” According to her, even though the organisation is only set to accept 100 women into its cohorts, it hopes to empower about 1000 women with knowledge, information, access to materials, and resources at its upcoming conference. The organisation said, “TechUp Africa Project is PAWEN’s initiative to empower African women to start successful careers in tech in one year. “We launch this with our Women in Tech Conference which will be taking place 12th of March in commemoration of the International Women’s Day 2022.” Copyright PUNCH.
