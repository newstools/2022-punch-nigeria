An anti-suicide campaign initiative, Suicide Is No Solution, and a non-governmental mental health organisation, Asido Foundation, have opposed the criminalisation of attempted suicide in Nigeria. This was disclosed in a statement signed by the Executive Secretary of SINS, Ngozi Andrew, on behalf of the two groups. The statement was made available to journalists in Lagos on Sunday. She said, “Attempted suicide is still a crime in Nigeria punishable under the Criminal Code Act, Cap. C38, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, which carries an imprisonment term of up to one year. However, we commend the Lagos State Government for repealing the law which makes attempted suicide punishable and we want to urge other states in Nigeria to follow suit. “Attempted suicide should not be a crime. Anybody who attempts to take his or her own life has come to the conclusion that life is no longer worth living; that individual is distressed with a strong need for professional mental health care, treatment, assistance and not punishment. Attempted suicide is a loud cry for help.” Andrew also faulted the new bill which proposed six months community service for citizens who attempt suicide. “We also oppose the new bill which was recently passed for second reading at the House of Representatives where six months community service and counselling are being proposed for those who attempt suicide. The proposed community service is still a punishment for persons with underlying mental and psychological disorder,” she said.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
