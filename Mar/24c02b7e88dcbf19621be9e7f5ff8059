An aspirant for the office of national youth leader of the All Progressives Congress, Dada Olusegun, has withdrawn from the race. Olusegun who announced his withdrawal in the early hours of Sunday at the party’s 2022 National Convention held at Eagle Square, Abuja, fought back tears. He is one of several aspirants who backed out of various party positions with respect to the consensus arrangement of the party as captured in the unity list released late Saturday. Olusegun withdrew in favour of the consensus candidate 36-year-old Abdullahi Israel from the Lagos state chapter. Meanwhile, the daughter of winner of the June 12 presidential elections, Moshood Abiola, Rinsola Abiola, has withdrawn from the national youth leader race. In a related development, former youth representative in the Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Ismaeel Ahmed, has withdrawn from the race for the office of National Organising Secretary in favour of the consensus candidate, Suleiman Argungu (Kebbi State).
