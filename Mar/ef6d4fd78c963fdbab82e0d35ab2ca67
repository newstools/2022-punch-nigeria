An operative of a local vigilante group simply identified as Elemchukwu has died after dane gun belonging to him fell and exploded at Ubima Community, Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State. The vigilante group codenamed OSPAC is one of the popular local security outfits in some local government areas of the state. The OSPAC Vice Chairman in Ubima community, Ikwerre LGA, Amadi Goodluck, confirmed the incident to newsmen. Goodluck said Elemchukwu died as a result of accidental discharge, saying reports making the rounds that members of the vigilante were involved in a shootout that led to the death of Elem is not true. “Yesterday around after 8am, I was in the office when I received a call that Elim has shot himself dead. “When we got there, we found him dead. I asked people around there what had happened to our boy. They showed me the shop where he came to buy something. “Then he left and started his motorcycle. He was holding a dane gun. In the process of starting the bike, the gun fell down, hitting its head on the ground. “The gun explode and touched him on his head. That is what led to his death. There was nothing like shootout or any problem,” Goodluck said. Efforts to reach the Acting Spokesperson of the state Police Command, Grace Iringe-Koko, proved abortive, though her mobile telephone rang out without a response as of the time of filing this report.
