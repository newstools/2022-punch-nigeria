Senator representing Gombe Central, Muhammad Goje, on Tuesday empowered no fewer than 1,000 youths from Gombe State with N30, 000 each to support their businesses. The 1,000 youths drawn from Yalmatu Deba and Akko Local Government Areas of the state were trained in various skills by the National Directorate of Employment towards attaining self-reliance. Speaking shortly after the presentation, Goje urged beneficiaries to utilise the money for the sake it was provided, adding that it was in line with his vision of alleviating the sufferings of the people. According to Goje, he had initially supported the beneficiaries with food packages, as well as starter packs comprising sewing machines and power generating set to boost their business. Goje, who was represented by his Special Assistant, Saidu Kumo,  said, “This programme is aimed at eradicating poverty and empowering our youths in Gombe Central to have access to economic well being and the beneficiaries are 1,000 that will get N30,000 each. “This has been the tradition of Senator Goje’s politics to empower people since the return of this democracy to get employment directly or indirectly.” Copyright PUNCH.
