Nollywood actress, Annie Idibia, has knocked the media for only wanting to share negative news about her husband and musician, 2Baba. The singer had on Tuesday inaugurated a multimillion naira music studio, he donated to the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. According to the actress, the news of the donation didn’t trend in the media because it was good news. She posited that if her husband had impregnated someone, everyone wouldn’t have stopped talking about it on the Internet. Reacting to a video by comedian, Efe Warriboy about the poor publicity the donation got, Annie said, “If the news was ‘2Baba give person belle or na him give Cora belle’ e go trend die. True or false e go still trend. Everywhere go burst.” She further added that the legacy was what mattered, and not whether the news trended or not. Annie said, “But, seriously though. My brother @efewarriboy, trend or not, the most important thing is that the legacy is there and it’s gonna be there forever! “And as long as that university still exists in Nigeria our country, in another 5/10/15 years etc., the next generation will still benefit from it. And that’s what is important! “It will always be there. It will be written in history! Our children’s children and the next generation would be happy and proud of their father. “2Baba does not make noise. It is what it is! Man don’t even care if it’s out there or not! He made a promise to the faculty of music students in OAU and he delivered more than expected! Great Ife! “I am still in awe of this human called Innocent Ujah Idibia aka 2BABA. I salute you sir @official2baba.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
