A former Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs in Kwara State, Aisha Ahman-Pategi, has defected from the ruling All Progressives Congress in the state to the Peoples Democratic Party. Aisha, who announced her defection at the PDP secretariat in Patigi Local Government Area, also drummed support for the agitation by the people of Kwara North to produce the governor in 2023. The PDP is the only political party in the state that has zoned its governorship ticket to Kwara North. Pategi, who served in Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq’s cabinet between December 2019 and December 2020 was received into the PDP fold by the Patigi local government chairman of PDP, Alhaji Saba Lalagi, some party chieftains and stakeholders, including a former Nigerian Ambassador to Japan, Prof Gana Yisa and a former Head of Service in the state, Alhaji Mohammed Dabarako. The former commissioner said she was excited by the warm reception accorded her, adding, “I’m back fully to support the drive and PDP’s efforts to balance political power for Kwara North in the 2023 governorship election. “I stand here today to tell anyone who is not with Kwara North for governor that they are no longer welcomed and any son or daughter of Kwara North that is not with Kwara North 2023 is officially disowned.” In his welcome address, the local government party chairman, Alhaji Lalagi, lauded the foresight of Ahman-Pategi, saying that her defection was indeed a morale booster for the PDP, not only in Patigi but also the entire state.
