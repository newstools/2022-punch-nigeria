The national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on Wednesday, met with the APC Senate caucus over his plan to succeed the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in 2023. While marketing himself to the lawmakers during the meeting, the former Lagos State governor, announced that his ambition to succeed Buhari was not for power. “This (presidential ambition) is not about gaining power. It is about securing good government for the nation,” Tinubu told the senators. On the reason for meeting with the lawmakers, Tinubu said, “I seek your partnership in my quest to become the Presidential Candidate of our party and to win the general elections in February 2023 for all APC candidates. “This is not about gaining power. It is about securing good government for the nation. “Together, the executive and legislative branches of this democratic tree must strive to cultivate and bring forth good fruit for the welfare of the people.” The senators, while responding through the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, wished the presidential aspirant well in his endeavours, adding that they are in support of his aspiration. Lawan said, “Your Excellency, once again, all of us wish you well, wish you the best of luck, wish you success in this and in the affair of fighting for APC, to continue to be the ruling party in Nigeria, and justifiably so, Your Excellency, we are with you.” Copyright PUNCH.
