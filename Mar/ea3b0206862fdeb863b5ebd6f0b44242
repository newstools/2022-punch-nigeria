A group, Concerned Southern Kaduna All Progressives Congress Stakeholders’ has called on Governor Nasir El-Rufai to support power shift to Southern Kaduna in 2023. According to the group, in the spirit of equity and fair play, El-Rufai should support the call for APC to zone its gubernatorial candidate to Southern Kaduna since the northern part would have held power for eight years of two terms by 2023. The State Governor has been advocating for Presidency to be zone to the South. It is in the same vain the Southern Kaduna APC stakeholders are appealing to Governor El-Rufai to support power shift to their region. A statement issued by the leader of the group, Joseph Gaiya, said their commitment and support to mobilise the Kaduna electorates for the APC to win and sustain itself in power in the 2023 general elections was active, adding that they would consolidate on the laudable legacy projects and strategic reforms El-Rufai brought. It stated, “Just like Nigeria which has six geo-political zones is politically carved into North and South based on the country’s power equation and treated as such, Kaduna State too, though made up of three Senatorial Zones is politically seen as Northern and Southern Kaduna. “It is in like manner that we hereby call on His Excellency, Governor Nasir El-Rufai to, in the spirit of equity and fair play, support the call for our great party – the APC for power to shift to Southern Kaduna for office of the Governor in 2023. By then, the Northern Kaduna would have held power for eight solid years of two terms.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
