Thousands of youths on Saturday converged on Calabar, the Cross River State capital, to sensitise young people to the need to support Governor Yahaya Bello’s presidential ambition in 2023. The youths, who came from different parts of the country, especially South-East and South-South, said though they had over 20 million youths with permanent voter cards already, they would not stop seeking the support of more youths in a bid to rescue Nigeria from its current challenges. The Coordinator, Rescue Nigeria Mission Project in the South-South, John Akainza, who led others to prevail on the Governor of Kogi State to declare his intention formally, assured him of the support of Nigerian youths for his ambition. Akainza said, “We have been going from house to house and school to school without you prompting us. I repeat that we are going to shock moneybags and show the world that we can install our own in Nigeria. Let the core politicians do theirs. It will be the first time in the history of Nigeria that we will change the narrative.” The South-West Coordinator of RENMISS, Bolanle Ninolowo, said, “This (Yahaya Bello) is the only candidate Nigerian youths have. He has demonstrated that our tomorrow is here in Kogi. We don’t want to be perpetual leaders of tomorrow but leaders of today.” The Chief of Staff to the Governor of Kogi State, Abdulkareem Jamiu Asuku, who was invited as keynote speaker, commended the youths for taking it upon themselves to create a Nigeria of their dreams.
