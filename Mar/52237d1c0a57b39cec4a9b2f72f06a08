The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, says the state will like to partner with TERAWORK, a tech platform for hiring freelancers, to explore the gig and digital economy. According to him, this partnership will help upskill youths and train them to seize employment opportunities in tech industries globally. He disclosed this while paying a visit to the business stand of the company during the Lagos Employment Summit organised by the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund. Sanwo-Olu said, “The Lagos State Government is scaling its intervention in critical areas of the economy. As part of that effort, we are rejigging the activities of the LSETF to broaden its impact in terms of strengthening the productivity of businesses and entrepreneurs. “What TERAWORK, which offers an impressive proposition and solutions that meet the expansive needs of the active segment, has put in place on its platform will help businesses raise their productivity level by leveraging the skills of a wide range of freelancers while also creating new job opportunities for the teeming youth segment.” The Chief Executive Officer, TERAWORK, Femi Taiwo, who spoke during a break out of the summit themed, ‘The Future of Work: Gig Economy’, said the gig economy is the locus of shared prosperity in the 21st century. According to him, it can be expanded to drive economic growth if appropriate national policies are formulated and implemented. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
