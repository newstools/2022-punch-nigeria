Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, has felicitated Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu as he clocks 70 years, describing the All progressives Congress national leader as a political colossus and a worthy kingmaker whose antecedents are worth celebrating. The congratulatory message, signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Muhammed Onogwu, on Monday, noted that the former Lagos governor had etched his name on the historical sands of time. He hailed Senator Tinubu’s vanguard roles as a founding father of the APC alongside President Muhammadu Buhari and other patriots, adding that he would always be a revered and respected leader in the Nigerian political sphere. On the eventful landmark of his platinum jubilee, governor Bello wishes Tinubu even more glorious years ahead – in resounding health and long life to continue breaking barriers and standing tall as an imitable role model for future generations. Bola Ahmed Adekunle Tinubu was born March 29, 1952. He is a Nigerian accountant and politician who has been the national leader of the All Progressives Congress since the party’s formation in 2013. He previously served as the governor of Lagos state from 1999 to 2007 and senator for Lagos-West during the brief third republic. In January 2022, he announced his intention to run for the APC nomination for President of Nigeria in the 2023 general elections. The Jagaban of Borgu land as fondly hailed remains a politically steadfast stakeholder in the Nigerian political space, who is loved by many, home and abroad – a hope of a better Nigeria for many.
