THE Lagos State Anti-Corruption and Transparency Commission 2022 Bill has scaled its second reading at the state House of Assembly. The Speaker of the House, Mudashiru Obasa, disclosed this in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Eromosele Ebhomele, on Tuesday. He said, “The Lagos State Anti-Corruption and Transparency Commission (Amendment) Bill 2022 scaled second reading on the floor of the House after which Dr Obasa committed it to the Committee on Judiciary for further action. “The member representing Eti-Osa II Constituency, Gbolahan Yishawu, and the member representing Ojo Constituency I, Victor Akande, while contributing to the debate on the bill, commended their colleagues for acting responsively and responsibly. The committee is expected to present its report to the House in a week.” The Assembly also confirmed a nominee of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Sikiru Salami, as the substantive Auditor-General of the state. Obasa announced the confirmation following a voice vote of members of the House during plenary. Salami had earlier appeared before the lawmakers for screening. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
