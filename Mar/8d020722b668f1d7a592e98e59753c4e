The Commissioner of Police, Anambra State, Echeng Echeng, has given the marching orders to heads of tactical units, divisional police officers and heads of departments across the Command to strictly enforce the state government’s ban on touting and illegal revenue collection. The governor, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, had, in his inaugural address on Thursday, announced the ban on touting and illegal revenue collection. In a statement in Awka on Sunday, Echeng tasked officers and men of the Command to ensure full compliance with the order, especially at motor parks and other designated places. The CP also warned those engaged in touting and other unlawful acts to desist forthwith as the police and other security agencies had been deployed around the state to arrest and bring to justice anyone caught flouting the order. He affirmed the commitment of the Command to crime prevention, restoration of law and order, and enjoined Anambra indigenes and all residents of the state to be vigilant and security conscious at all times.
