The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Sunday in Abuja, said Vice President Yemi Osinbajo will be in charge while he is away in London, the United Kingdom, on a two-week routine medical check-up. Buhari said this just before his aircraft, Nigeria Air Force 1, took off from the Presidential Wing of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, at about 2pm on Sunday. “I cannot claim to be doing the work alone. The government is fully represented. The Vice President is there. “Constitutionally when I am away, he is in charge. And then the Secretary to the Government and the Chief of Staff are also there. So, there is no problem,” Buhari said. Buhari was earlier scheduled to leave Nairobi for London after attending the 50th anniversary of the United Nations Environmental Programme. He, however, returned to Abuja on Friday. Meanwhile, the President also said the ruling All Progressives Congress has the capacity to resolve its internal issues and hold the national convention slated for March 26. When asked about his opinion on those who fear that the party might self-destruct due to the current internal crisis, Buhari said, “Well, they should wait and see how did we come as a party to take power from the ruling party who had been there before us for so many years. So, we have the capacity; everything will be alright.” The President was accompanied to the airport by his Chief of Staff, Prof Ibrahim Gambari; Minister of State for the Federal Capital Territory, Ramatu Aliyu; and the Director-General of Department of State Security, Yusuf Bichi.
