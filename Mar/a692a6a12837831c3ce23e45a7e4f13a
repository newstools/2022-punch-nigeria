Following the reported endorsement of Senator Abdullahi Adamu, a former governor of Nasarawa State, for the All Progressives Congress chairmanship position by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), Senator Tanko Al-Makura, also a former governor of Nasarawa State, has vowed not to withdraw from the party’s chairmanship race. Although other aspirants have reportedly withdrawn to favour the president’s anointed candidate, Al-Makura has continued to intensify his campaign for the position. Al-Makura, while speaking with journalists in Abuja, on Sunday, said the report that Buhari has endorsed a candidate was a speculation. “The sources of information were not authentic. They were not genuine. And I know what Mr. President stands for, he always stands for what is right and due process. And unless I have an authoritative source of information that is clear. I still have my doubts. I have many avenues through which I can reach Mr. President and people around him. “And since those speculation did not come through those avenues, I consider them as a speculation. That is why as I speak with you, my campaign is going with a different tempo, to ensure that my campaign is going far and wide to await the next line of action as directed by the party leadership,” he said.
