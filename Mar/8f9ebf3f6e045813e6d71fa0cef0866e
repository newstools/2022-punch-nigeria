A group, Amalgamation of Youth Associations from the North-West Geopolitical Zone, have declared their support for late Chief MKO Abiola’s daughter, Rinsola, to contest for National Youth Leader of the All Progressives Congress. The Zonal Coordinator for the group, Sabiu Ibrahim, made their position known at a news conference in Kano on Thursday. He said the decision of the group to support Abiola’s contest followed an exhaustive deliberation with various youth associations from the zone. “We have come to agree on common ground in support of the daughter of the legend, late Chief MKO Abiola, Rinsola Abiola, who is contesting for the position of National Youth Leader under the platform of the ruling APC. “One of our strong points, apart from her suitability for the position, is that the position has been zoned to South-West geopolitical zone where she comes from,” Ibrahim said. According to him, Abiola has all it takes to contest for the position and bring new changes for the development of youths in the overall national development. “She believes in creating spaces for our women and young ones and above all, she is unarguably patriotic and detribalised, just like her father, Chief MKO Abiola, of blessed memory. “A large chunk of us are APC card-carrying members. We also have among us political activists, who believe in the promotion of women in governance and politics. “We believe if given the opportunity, she will mobilise young voters for the 2023 elections through extensive nationwide engagements with different segments of youth across the country,” he said.
