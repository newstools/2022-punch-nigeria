A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party in Osun State, Prince Diran Odeyemi, on Sunday urged Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, to support his Oyo State counterpart, Seyi Makinde, and ensure victory for the PDP in the Ekiti and Osun state governorship polls. Odeyemi, who is the immediate past Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, in a statement obtained in Osogbo, also commended Wike for his loyalty and commitment towards making PDP, the ruling party at the federal level. He, however, said the plan by the PDP to retake power at the centre in 2023 would be determined by the party’s performance in Ekiti and Osun governorship polls and called on Wike and Makinde to come up with strategies that would deliver the two states to the party. The statement read in part, “Governor Wike’s commitment to PDP is not hidden at all. It is obvious he is determined to ensure PDP get back power at the centre. “We are now using this medium to tell him that he should support his brother, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State and devise a winning strategy that will ensure victory for PDP in Ekiti and Osun governorship polls. “We members of PDP are giving him our words that we will reward his loyalty, commitment to the party, whenever he needs it.” Copyright PUNCH.
