Nollywood actor, Williams Uchemba, has revealed his true reason for attending Davido’s March 5 concert at the O2 Arena. The actor, who is known for showcasing his Christian background, noted that he went to the 20,000-seater Arena because he couldn’t learn production setup in such capacity while in church. Also stating that people may be surprised that he attended such an event, the father-of-one, in an Instagram post on Sunday night, hailed the capacity and volume of production equipment used at the venue. Hailing the singer, Uchemba said, “Yesterday, the Nigerian Entertainment industry was once again put on the global map elm Congratulations once again @davido for selling out @theo2london. “In my 22 years of being in the industry and making films I have NEVER seen the capacity and volume of production/setup I witnessed yesterday. I saw like 1,000 equipment boxes and I couldn’t count the men on ground, working like robots. It was mind blowing. “Someone might say, ‘Williams, you go to this kind of event?’ “Yes I do, because I can’t learn backstage management and production setup in this capacity in church.” In his post, the actor also shared a video of himself and Davido during the production setup ahead of the concert.
