Confirming the development in a chat with The PUNCH, Commissioner for Political Affairs and Intergovernmental Relations, Taiwo Akeju, said Governor Adegboyega Oyetola and other stakeholders of the ruling party in Osun State are in support of Omisore’s ambition.

Commenting further, Akeju, who is an associate of Omisore, said the two-term Senator representing Osun East in the Senate had picked a form to contest for the post.
