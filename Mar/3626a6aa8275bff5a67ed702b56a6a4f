A Permanent Secretary in the Plateau State Ministry of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, Sunday Biggs, on Wednesday declared his intention to contest the 2023 governorship election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress. Making his intention known while addressing party members from his ward, local government, supporters and other stakeholders who gathered at the NUT Hall hall in Mangu on Wednesday, he said he had been privileged to work with technocrats and public officers which best qualified him for the job. Biggs, who had served as Protocol Officer to Governor Simon Lalong and former governor Jonah Jang, said, “First, I lay no claim to no one but God who has seen me, the son of a peasant rise to the pinnacle of the civil service career. “From a humble beginning in the civil service, by dint of hard work and commitment to the service of our state and people, I rose to the position of Permanent Secretary. “In the course of my work and growth in service, I have been privileged to work with technocrats and public officers. “My work has made me interact with captains of industry, top technocrats, diplomats and a cross-section of top political leaders of this country. “This has positioned me with the understanding and knowledge of issues and dynamics of developmental governance as well as social, economic and infrastructural re-engineering. “I make bold to say I have learned a lot from our leaders, past and present. I have tapped from their wisdom, expertise and knowledge and  equipped with experience to offer myself as the next chief servant leader of Plateau State.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
