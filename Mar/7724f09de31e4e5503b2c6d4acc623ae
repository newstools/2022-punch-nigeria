The Edo State Government, on Thursday, said it had commenced the process of abolishing the laws of sedition and criminal defamation to engender freedom of speech needed by media practitioners and in line with the laws of the land. Governor Godwin Obaseki stated this as a keynote speaker at the maiden Radio Nigeria, Bronze FM Benin inaugural lecture and award with the theme, ‘Deepening democracy: Role of the media’. Represented by the Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Andrew Emwanta, the governor said last week, the State Executive Council considered and approved five executive bills for onward transmission to the state House of Assembly for legislative action, one of which was the Edo State Criminal Law, 2022 Bill. “Under the proposed law, the provisions on sedition and criminal defamation were taken out in line with decisions of appellate courts, which align with constitutional provisions on the right to freedom of expression and the press,” he stated. In his remarks, Chairman of the event and the National President of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, Chris Isiguzo, charged the media to help Nigerians choose the right candidates ahead of the 2023 general elections. He said “Without the media, there is no democracy. We normally say the judiciary is the last hope of the common man, but the current reality is that the media is now the last hope of the common man. The media must be alive to its role as we move forward to the 2023 elections. “Virtually every state today has a presidential aspirant, but the media must bring these characters to the people and help them decide the right people.” Copyright PUNCH.
