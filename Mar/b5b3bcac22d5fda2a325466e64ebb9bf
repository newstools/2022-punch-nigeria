Residents of Ungwar Yazawa community in the Lafia Local Government Area of Nasarawa State, on Monday, protested against the power outage in the community, saying the situation had worsened the insecurity in the area. A spokesperson for the community, Shuibu Zanwa-Buba, after a peaceful protest at the head office of the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company, Lafia, said the community had been thrown into darkness for the past eight months, adding that the AEDC turned deaf ears to their cries. He explained that the protest was to draw the attention of the state government to the unfair treatment and injustice being meted out to the community by the firm. He said, “For the past eight months, residents of Ungwar Yazawa community in Lafia LGA have been living in darkness. There has not been electricity supply despite the efforts we made to get a new transformer from the state government; the AEDC has refused to connect us till now. “Governor Abdullahi Sule approved our request and released the transformer for over two months now, but the AEDC seems to be deliberately working against the interest of the community for reasons best known to them. “We are appealing to the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission to intervene in this matter and call the AEDC to order so that the new transformer would be fixed to ensure the growth and development of the community.” The Human Resource Manager of AEDC, Lafia branch, Zainab Ibrahim, assured the community that the transformer would soon be fixed and powered for sufficient electricity supply as directive had been given to staff of the company on the matter.
