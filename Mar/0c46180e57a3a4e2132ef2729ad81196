THE Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency has sensitised residents of Oshodi-Isolo Local Government Area to the need to report and tackle sexual and gender-based violence. According to a statement on Saturday, the Executive Secretary of DSVA, Mrs Titilola Vivour-Adeniyi, disclosed this during an outreach on sexual violence held at Oshodi-Isolo. She said, “The goal of the outreach is to raise awareness about sexual and gender-based violence, as well as issues regarding child abuse whilst making reference to DSVA’s data over the years of the increase in formal and informal reporting of incidents of rape, domestic violence and child abuse from Oshodi-Isolo LGA. “There is a need for all participants to see themselves as mandated reporters; if you see something, you have a duty to say something and do something.” The Chairman of Oshodi Isolo LGA, Kayode Almaroof, who was represented by the Vice Chairman, Mrs Modupe Badmus, urged parents to listen to their children when they confide in them. “People should speak up if they are subjected to violence in their relationships in order to curb the rate of violence in the society. Parents, especially mothers, should always pay attention and listen to their children so that they can confide in them when they face abuse,” she said. The Executive Director, Centre for Women’s Health Information, Mrs Atinuke Odukoya, said people should stop blaming victims as this could discourage victims of sexual and gender violence from reporting abuses.
