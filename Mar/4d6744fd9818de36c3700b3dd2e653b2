A former governor of Ondo State, Dr Olusegun Mimiko, has denied an allegation making the rounds that he caused the state to lose hosting the Dangote crude oil refinery to Lagos State because he demanded a bribe from Aliko Dangote. It was gathered that the project was initially planned to be sited at the Olokola Free Trade Zone in the Ilaje Local Government Area of Ondo State, but was later taken to Lagos State. Denying the allegation in a statement on Wednesday, Mimiko described it as falsehood and mischievous. The statement was issued by Mimiko’s Special Assistant on Media and Digital Communications, Mr John Akinduro. It read in part, “Reports of the often repeated falsehood about Aliko Dangote opting out of the Olokola FTZ for his refinery project owing to an alleged demand for personal benefit by Dr Olusegun Mimiko has been brought to our notice. “We state that this lie is totally reprehensible. That otherwise informed people are repeating the utter falsehood is sad. “We state for the umpteenth time that Mimiko did not make any personal demand, cash or kind, or receive any personal gratification that led to the location of the factory in Lekki instead of Olokola.” “Again, this allegation is a blatant lie and we hope that Alhaji Aliko Dangote will, one day, volunteer facts on why he chose Lekki over Olokola.”  Copyright PUNCH.
