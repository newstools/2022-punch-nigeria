Former Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Chief Hazeem Gbolarumi, has said he is ready to unseat Governor Seyi Makinde in 2023. Gbolarumi, said this on Friday in an interview with journalists in Ibadan on the sidelines of the activity to mark his 65th birthday on Friday. Gbolarumi was the deputy governor when the late Chief Adebayo Alao-Akala was governor between 2007 and 2011. The former deputy governor, who is one of the leaders of the aggrieved members of the Peoples Democratic Party, said Makinde had disappointed many people, especially those who worked for him to win the governorship election in 2019. Earlier, while addressing his supporters and well-wishers, Gbolarumi said it was the will of God to bring Makinde in as governor in 2019 but stated that it is the will of the same God to remove him from office now. He said, “ The governor in office now is not a good person. We all worked for him to emerge victorious and he chased everybody who assisted him away immediately after he assumed office. “ It is the will of God and the same God will remove him. He is an ingrate. Some are saying we should leave him to God but politicians do not do that. We won’t leave him to God.” Speaking in an interview with journalists, he said defeating the incumbent governor would not be an impossible task. However, the PDP Publicity Secretary in the state, Akeem Olatunji, said, “Some of the members who claimed to be aggrieved are merely acting out their frustrations after their candidates in government were either redeployed due to incompetence or shown the exit door due to gross misconduct Copyright PUNCH.
