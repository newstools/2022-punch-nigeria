Nigeria is facing serious economic and security challenges, the Senator representing Lagos East Senatorial District, Tokunbo Abiru, has said. Abiru made this known during a media parley over the weekend while giving a report of his 14 months in office in the National Assembly. He said, “Ladies and gentlemen of the press, I will be the first to admit that the economic and security challenges facing the county are daunting. Indeed, at no time in our recent past has the nation’s economy, well-being, peace and unity been so vigorously and persistently challenged. “I however urge you not to despair but to remain hopeful. I believe that as we work conscientiously and openly, and together with unity of purpose and solidarity and with God on our side, we shall overcome all these challenges facing us. “The next few months is a time to strive to be better people and to also leverage on the lessons of the preceding months. Importantly it is not a time to be wasteful or careless about our economic activities, rather a time to harness every economic growth that the realities of the past years have thrown in our hands. “As we also know that 2022 is the penultimate year to the general elections of 2023, it is important to begin to assess our individual aspirations towards ensuring that Nigeria becomes a better place and this can only be achieved by ensuring that we all get registered as eligible voters and prepare to exercise our civic responsibilities without fears.” Abiru also said he has been able to facilitate projects worth over N1bn in key areas for constituency in the 2022 Appropriation Act.
