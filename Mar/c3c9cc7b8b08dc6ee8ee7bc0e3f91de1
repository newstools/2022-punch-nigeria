Traders and sympathisers, on Friday, rescued a young porter from being molested by a soldier after he mistakenly hit a Nigerian Army vehicle at popular Monday Market in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital. In a trending video, traders and members of the public were seen making donations to repair the vehicle as insisted by the soldier. A sympathiser explained in the video, “This boy inside the vehicle has been arrested by the soldier driving this army vehicle that he hit his car. The boy mistakenly hit the vehicle while trying to manoeuvre past the busy road with his cart, which is loaded with goods. The soldier arrested him and insisted that the boy must repair his vehicle for him. “We don’t want the boy to be taken to the barracks. That is why we are making donations to pay the soldier since the boy cannot afford to pay him.” The boy was seen seated at the back of the army Hilux van parked on the road, which is under construction, along with some bags of rice, while donations were being made by members of the public to secure his release.
