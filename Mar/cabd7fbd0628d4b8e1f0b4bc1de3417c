Everyone is on the lookout for the next millionaire-making cryptocurrency. Over the last year, almost every major crypto project shot up by 1000s and sometimes 1000000s per cent. Those that didn’t reach new heights, like Ripple (XRP), often had good reason. In the case of XRP, it is currently waging an ongoing court battle over its legitimacy with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The most famous examples of cryptocurrencies that made fortunes for their backers are Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). A whole host of meme coins followed in rising exponentially and are looking to gain momentum in 2022. New releases, such as the promising Seesaw Protocol (SSW), are looking to follow in the footsteps of DOGE and SHIB and make 2022 just as profitable as 2021. Dogecoin (DOGE) was launched in 2013 as a satirical response to Bitcoin (BTC). It is based on the widely popular Doge meme, which reached the height of its popularity around the same time. Despite being almost 10 years old, DOGE only really exploded into public consciousness at the beginning of 2021. Dogecoin increased by more than 15000% from the start of 2021 to its current high of $0.7376, which it reached in May of last year. Since this high point, it hasn’t been plain sailing for DOGE. It is currently 83% down on its ATH, having endured a tough start to 2022. Several brief spikes in value have been outliers amidst the general downward trend, and its price at the time of writing is $0.1241. Shiba Inu (SHIB) maybe 14th when ranked by total market cap, one position below 13th placed Dogecoin (DOGE), but it outperformed its canine rival in 2021. From the beginning of 2021 to its peak at the end of October 2021, it shot up from $0.000000000119 to $0.00008845. This is an almost unbelievable rise of 74,327,600%. Investing just $2 in SHIB at the beginning of 2021 would have been enough to make a millionaire. Similarly to DOGE, SHIB has also suffered several sustained dips in the last few months. It is more than 70% down on its ATH. The extremely volatile nature of meme coins means that SHIB could rise once again at any moment, although only the most optimistic of SHIB backers believe that it could surpass its previous high and challenge the price of Dogecoin.  Seesaw Protocol (SSW) has begun Stage 2 of its presale after an unprecedented success in Stage 1. At the beginning of its presale, SSW was priced at $0.005. In the 6 weeks since SSW has continued to increase day by day and is currently more than 2000% up. A $1000 investment would be worth over $20k and is improving all the time. The nature of the presale means that the price can only improve from now until its launch on April the 8th. Some analysts have predicted SSW could go up by another 3000% or more. The token itself will aim to bridge the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), with the Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon (MATIC). The popularity of NFTs has put the Ethereum network under the spotlight and shown its often high gas fees and slow transaction times to be a problem. SSW will look to solve this. SSW has the added utility that, for the most part, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) don’t offer. If SSW can reach, or nearly reach, the levels of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, it could make substantial amounts of money for its presale investors.
