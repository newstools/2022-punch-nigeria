Elder statesman and former Head of State, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, has appealed to Plateau residents on peaceful coexistence to stimulate development. Gowon made the call while unveiling the redesigned oldest golf course in Nigeria, Rayfield 1913 on Saturday in Jos. He said that Plateau people and Nigerians should explore all necessary measures in the pursuit of peace, while respecting the sanctity of life at all times. The former head of state expressed sadness on the determination of a few criminal minded people and groups’ resolution to terrorise the country. While commending the Nigerian Armed Forces personnel for their gallant efforts in dealing with criminals across the country, he urged Nigerians to support security agencies through exposing their activities. The elder statesman expressed delight in the progress of Golf in Plateau and Nigeria, commending Lalong for his efforts in developing the game in the state. “I commend Lalong for his passion for the game and also redeveloping the Rayfield Golf Course which is now comparable to any standard course in Nigeria,” he said. In his remarks, Lalong thanked Gowon for honouring the state to unveil the redesigned Rayfield Golf Course, saying its historic significance must be cherished and economic potential in sports harnessed. Lalong said that his efforts to foster peace and expose criminal activities and crisis merchants had helped in building the confidence of people to visit the State. Gowon and Lalong later performed symbolic shots to commemorate the event. (NAN)
