Fans of Nigeria Professional Football League side, Shooting Stars, fear their darling team may be relegated after they failed to record a win in their last five league games. The Oluyole Warriors’ last league win came in a 1-0 victory over relegation-threatened Dakkada FC in Ibadan. The team have since gone on to record three losses and two draws in their last five games of the season. 3SC were relegated to the lower division in the 2017 campaign and returned to the topflight in 2021 and fans are afraid they may return to the lower division if results don’t change. After their 2-0 loss to Rivers United on Sunday, the Oluyole Warriors are currently 13th on the league table and are billed to face struggling Kano Pillars in their match-day 18 fixture in Ibadan, which fans claim is a must-win if they intend to spend the next season in the league. “Edith Agoye and his coaching staff can’t help us stay in the league if we continue like this. Five games without a win is too much and if we don’t start picking results especially against Kano Pillars, then we are in trouble,” Ahmed Adeniji wrote on Twitter. “Very poor and dismal performance from the @oluyolewarriors so far. The club needs to up their game to avoid unnecessary permutations toward end of the season,” another fan wrote. Shittu Idris added, “You better do well to get good results at home because we all know the way things are in the league, you can’t be losing too many points at home if you don’t want to go down.” Copyright PUNCH.
