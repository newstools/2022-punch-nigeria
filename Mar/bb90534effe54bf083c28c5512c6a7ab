The Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria says the submission of the Nigerian Code of Corporate Governance 2018 report must be done virtually by organisations through the council’s online web portal. A statement by the council said the concerned organisations included all public companies and their holding companies, concessioned/privatised companies, regulated private companies as defined in the Regulation to NCCG 2018 (“entities”). “The web portal is developed to further enhance ease of doing business, reduction of cost, time, and effort taken to comply with NCCG 2018, and serve as a repository for investors, researchers, and other stakeholders to gather and generate corporate governance information on Nigerian entities in both the private and public sectors,” the statement said. The council said it had issued guidance to assist firms to use the portal seamlessly. It said, “The go-live date for the portal is March 22, 2022. With effect from this date, the NCCG 2018 Compliance Reporting Web Portal can be accessed at the council website.” It added, “With effect from this date, the council will neither accept physical hard copies nor emails for the NCCG 2018 compliance report. “The deadline for NCCG 2018 compliance reporting for entities with year-end December 31, 2021, is hereby extended by 1 month to April 30, 2022.” It added that the deadline for reporting on compliance with NCCG 2018 remains three months after the year-end of the company.
