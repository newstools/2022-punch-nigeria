Ebonyi State governor, David Umahi, has insisted that the Governor of Yobe State, Mr Mai Mala Buni, remained the Caretaker Committee chairman of the All Progressives Congress. He said this in Abakaliki while also vowing to deal with members of the opposition – the Peoples Democratic Party, in the state. Umahi said that there’s no crisis in the APC and tasked party members to dispel the rumours that the ruling party is divided. He said, “We are battle-ready. This is not about the Governor of Ebonyi State; Nigerians are fighting for us. I want to thank the National Chairman of APC. And let me tell you that there is no division in APC. The chairman went on medical leave. And we were there when he asked the governor of Niger State, Mr Bello, to act for him. “If there will be change, it will be notified. But for now, there is no change, and there is no crack. It is the PDP that is doing everything to destroy this country. But let me tell you, the attention of our party, the APC, has been drawn to all their antics, why they are misleading this country.” He also said that though there could be PDP in Abuja, there was no PDP in Ebonyi State. The PUNCH had earlier reported that a Federal High Court in Abuja, on Tuesday, sacked Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, and his Deputy, Dr Eric Kelechi Igwe, over their defection from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressive Congress.
