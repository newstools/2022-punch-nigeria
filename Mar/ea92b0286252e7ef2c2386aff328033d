Ahead of the forthcoming convention of the All Progressives Congress, a former chairman of the party in Ondo State, Mr Isaac Kekemeke said the party needed an experienced and non-sectional person as a national chairman, to rejig the party. He also expressed optimism that the current issues surrounding the holding of the convention would be resolved, saying the APC governors were up to the task. Kekemeke stated this in Akure, the state capital, on Sunday. According to him, the issues challenging the party, were not an uncommon thing in any political party, assuring that the matter would be resolved by the leaders. He said, “This convention is quite challenging for the APC because of the many contending tendencies and interests. This is not unusual in any political party. I believe that our leaders and our governors are up to the task. “The bigger job is for the post-convention leadership to have the requisite capacity to fairly and sincerely rejig the party. A competent, experienced, large-hearted, nonsectional, and cool-headed chairman. A former Ondo State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, who is vying for the national vice chairmanship (South West) of the party, said the state governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu endorsed his aspiration. “The governor of Ondo State is the leader of the All Progressives Congress in Ondo State, and also one of the leaders in the South West and in Nigeria. I am contesting for the office of National Vice- Chairman (South West) with his approval and my understanding is that that is what Ondo State has got,” Kekemeke stated. Copyright PUNCH.
