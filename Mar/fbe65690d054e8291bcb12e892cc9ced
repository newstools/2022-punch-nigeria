Former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar has endorsed the update of his policy document ahead of the 2023 presidential election. This was made known in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary of Atiku Support Organisation, Dr Victor Moses. In 2018, Abubakar also kicked off his campaign for the 2019 polls with a launch of a policy document, comprising his vision for Nigeria and his action plan to achieve it. The statement read, “Following the directives and authorisation of Atiku Abubakar who is contesting in the 2023 Presidential Election under the Peoples Democratic Party, the Atiku Support Organisation, the umbrella body of all support groups has composed a team of young professionals to update the 2019 Atiku’s Policy Document. “The decision of Abubakar to assign the task to young professionals has again proven that he is ready to work with and eminently engage young Nigerians to build a better and modern society, prosperous and sustainable future for our country, Nigeria. “The team is to update and reinfuse ‘the Atiku Plan’ document used in the 2019 Presidential Election campaign to reflect current realities. “The update will be done in partnership with His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar, and in consultation with relevant groups and agencies, selected top experienced and exposed individuals and others with variable knowledge in endeavours that align with what obtains in modern societies.”
