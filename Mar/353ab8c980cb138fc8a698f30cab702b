The Taraba State Commissioner for Budget and Planning, Elisha Solomon, says the state’s vision 2030 strategic document is key to the realisation of the state government’s plans to build a modern state by 2030. Solomon, in an interview with our correspondent in Jalingo on Tuesday, explained that the Rescue Mission agenda of the present administration was designed in line with the greater Taraba vision. He added that the government was working hard to mainstream the Rescue Vision into the Vision 2030 through infrastructure revolution, empowerment and employment. “We are working hard to deliver on the vision. The dualisation of the road into the city and out with a flyover bridge and other bridges is part of the vision. “The massive employment into the civil service and the Rescue Teachers scheme where over 3,000 teachers were engaged are all key indices of the vision. “If God helps us and we are able to get people into leadership positions in 2023 persons who will carry on with the vision, then our planned modern Taraba by 2030 will be possible,” he said.
