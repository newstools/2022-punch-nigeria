Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen has expressed delight over his record-breaking performance against Udinese on Saturday. Osihmen inspired a 2-1 win over Udinese to help Napoli climb level on points with Serie A leaders AC Milan on Saturday as an ultra-tight fight for the title heats up in Italy. Osimhen was the hero of the hour as his two goals on 53 and 63 minutes sealed the win at the Stadio Maradona in Napoli for Luciano Spalletti’s rampaging side. After his double at Verona last week got Napoli back to winning ways Osimhen, still wearing a face mask to protect his injured cheekbone, levelled the scores with a header after Gerard Deulofeu’s opener midway through the first half for the visitors, before his cross-shot put them ahead. Napoli now have 63 points, level with AC Milan, who play at Cagliari later, and four points ahead of Inter Milan who have played two games less and take on Fiorentina at home also on Saturday. Udinese had Pablo Marri sent off on 82 minutes as the visitors came under growing pressure, but saw out the match without further damage. Napoli are chasing a first Serie A title since the days when Diego Maradona inspired them to their only Italian league titles in 1987 and 1990. “A very important victory for us,” Osimhen told the media. “There was an incredible atmosphere in the second half which helped us. I thank the fans for their support.” It is the second consecutive league game in which Osimhen will score an identical brace – first a header, then a clinical foot finish – after helping Napoli go past Verona last week. For a striker who wears a mask due to a head injury sustained earlier in the campaign, Osimhen appears to hold no fear in heading the ball. When asked if he feels comfortable nodding the ball so often, the 23-year-old responded, “For the doctor, it is advisable to use it (mask) and therefore I will continue to use it even if I do not take it to training.”
