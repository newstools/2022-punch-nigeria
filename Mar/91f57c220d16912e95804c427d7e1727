Gaidam further stated that the commission has also approved the decentralisation of the Continuous Voter Registration to registration areas/wards level on rotational basis so as to cover eligible voters located far away from the CVR centres. He added that the approved schedule for the rotation by LGAs will be given wider publicity for prospective registrants in the affected locations to avail themselves of the long awaited opportunity for registration with ease. He said the CVR will be suspended around June preparatory to processing the data in readiness for the elections, adding that the commission has granted approval for the redeployment of Heads of Departments and Electoral Officers who have stayed long in their states of posting.
