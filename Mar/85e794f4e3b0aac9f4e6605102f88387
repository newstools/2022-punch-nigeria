A Kano Chief Magistrates’ Court on Friday discharged a housewife, Mrs Jamila Sani, in the alleged murder of a five-year-old girl, Hanifa Abubakar. Sani is the wife of the school proprietor, Abdulmalik Tanko, who was alleged to have masterminded the murder of the pupil. The Kano State Government had charged Tanko, Hashimu Isyaku and Fatima Musa, all of Tudun Murtala Quarters, Kano, with criminal conspiracy, attempt to kidnap, abetment/kidnapping and concealment of a corpse. The Chief Magistrate, Muhammad Jibril, discharged Sani and ordered that she should be released to her family. Earlier, the prosecution counsel, Mr Lamido Soron-Dinki, made an application to terminate the First Information Report and discharge the defendant relying on the provisions of sections 125 and 376 of the ACJL Kano State, 2019. “Based on our investigation, we found that the defendant had no hand in the alleged murder of the minor,” Soron-Dinki said. Recall that Sani was arraigned on January 27 for allegedly keeping the minor in her house at Tudun Murtala Quarters Kano for five days.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
