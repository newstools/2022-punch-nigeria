Members of the All Progressives Congress faction loyal to the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, in Kwara State have dumped the party. Our correspondent however gathered that while a few of them have pitched tent with the Social Democratic Party, majority of them are still constituting a third force and are yet to join a particular existing political party. Meanwhile, a member of the state House of Assembly, Saheed Popoola, representing Ojomu/Balogun Constituency in Offa Local Government of the state who was a leading member of the faction, announced his defection to the SDP on the floor of the Assembly on Tuesday. Popoola, the only two-term member in the 24-member House of Assembly was elected on the platform of the APC for a second term tenure in the 2019 elections.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
