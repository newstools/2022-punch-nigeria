THE wife of the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, on Monday, slumped at the Federal High Court in Abuja. Ramatu Kyari fell to the floor while men of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency were leading her husband and others away from the court premises. She was quickly rushed into one of the offices in the court by NDLEA officials and lawyers for medical attention. The development followed the deferment of ruling on her husband’s bail application by the presiding judge, Justice Emeka Nwite. The judge deferred ruling on applications filed by Kyari and six other persons facing drug trafficking charges that they be released on bail pending the determination of the case against them. The judge adjourned the bail applications until March 28. Justice Nwite adjourned the bail application after Kyari’s lawyers and the prosecution counsel argued their positions for and against the request. The judge also ordered that Kyari and the six others should be remanded in the NDLEA custody pending the determination of the matter. Ramatu later came out of the office and was assisted by some close friends and family members. While she was being attended to, the NDLEA officers waited for Kyari outside the court for several minutes. Kyari was arraigned on eight counts bordering on conspiracy, obstruction, dealing in cocaine, among others. The other defendants in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/57/2022, are four members of the police Intelligence Response Team, Sunday Ubia, Bawa James, Simon Agirigba and John Nuhu. Copyright PUNCH.
