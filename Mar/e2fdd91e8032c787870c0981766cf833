The founder of Enemona Foundation, Amb Gabriel Onoja, has said that nothing in life excites him more than humanitarian gestures aimed at touching the lives of the less privileged positively. Onoja stated this on Saturday while being honored by the Correspondents’ Chapel of the Kogi State Council of Nigeria Union of Journalists. He said giving had always been his major source of joy and nothing else excites him more than putting smiles on the faces of others, especially the less privileged. “I am always happy to put smiles on the faces of others and this honour would propel me into doing more for the society I found myself in,” Onoja stated. The philanthropist appreciated the honour done to him, assuring that it will spur him to do more. He expressed his readiness to continue to partner with the media in his humanitarian services to the needy in the society. Earlier, the Chairman of the Correspondent Chapel, Kogi State Council of the NUJ, Friday Idachaba, called on well to do Nigerians to emulate Onoja’s humanitarian gesture. Copyright PUNCH.
