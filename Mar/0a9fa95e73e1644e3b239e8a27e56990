The Peoples Democratic Party on Sunday in Abuja denied releasing any timetable of activities ahead of the 2023 general elections. The party’s National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, disclosed this in a statement titled ‘PDP has not released timetable for 2023 general elections.’ The party said it has spotted a “fake election timetable” being circulated in the social media, purported to have been signed and released by the National Organising Secretary, Umar Bature. The PDP stated that it is has “not released any timetable or any schedule of activities whatsoever for the 2022/2023 electioneering year and no such document was signed and released by the National Organising Secretary. “For the avoidance of doubt, the PDP is a party of due process and will release a timetable and schedule of activities for the 2022/2023 electioneering year after extensive consultation and approval by critical and statutory organs of the party at appropriate levels.” It explained that the timetable and schedule of activities being circulated in the social media is the handiwork of mischievous elements who seek to create confusion, mislead the public and distract the party at this critical time. The party, therefore, called on all its members and the general public to discountenance the said timetable as it did not emanate from the PDP. “At the appropriate time, the official timetable and schedule of activities of the PDP, when approved, will be formally announced and published through the official communication channels of our party and not in the social media,” it said.
