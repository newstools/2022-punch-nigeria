A chieftain of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, Victor Umeh, and the Deputy Speaker, Anambra State House of Assembly, Pascal Agbodike, have said the incoming administration of Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, was committed to producing future football greats in the same mould as legends Nwankwo Kanu, Austin  Eguavoen, Austin Okocha and Mikel Obi in Anambra State. To actualise this vision, Umeh and Agbodike said the governor-elect had already put in place all the necessary tools to float a strong football club for the state when he assumed office. The two politicians made the disclosure at separate interviews during the final match of the just-concluded Soludo’s Victory U-17 Inter Local Government Football Championship at the Awka City Stadium on Saturday. Nnewi North Council Area beat Onitsha North Council Area 5-0 in the final to emerge winners. Umeh and Agbodike also commended the incumbent governor, Willie Obiano, on the construction of the Awka City Stadium. In his remarks, shortly after the game, the sponsor of the championship, Asha Nnabuife, described the tournament as a veritable platform to discover and nurture up-and-coming football talents. The championship was organised by All Soludo Support Groups.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
