A former President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Wole Olanipekun (SAN), has lamented that Nigeria, in its current state, is asleep  it needs strong institutions to progress. Olanipekun stated this during his conferment with the 2022 Leadership Without Title award by the Prof Pat Utomi-led Centre for Values in Leadership. He noted that countries make progress when they have succeeded in building strong institutions in both public and private sectors. Olanipekun, during a colloquium themed ‘Professionalism in public service’, stated that the country needed a revolution, not military intervention, to redeem itself. He said, “Every one of us needs to do a rethink on the kind of country we want to bequeath to our children. Nigeria is asleep. The truth must be told. Nigeria is a big elephant. Those of us who have benefitted from this country, we must not allow it to fall. “We must demonstrate traits of leadership anywhere we are. I want a country that is well-governed. I want a country I would be proud of. I want a country that has fidelity.” Speaking earlier, Utomi noted that the awards and colloquium were initiated to honour outstanding sector leaders for their special contributions in the sector where they worked, adding that the programmes are in keeping with his organisation’s commitment to affect the next generation, to be leaders without care for titles. Also speaking, the Country Director, DAI Global, Joe Abah, noted that the constitution of the country is flawed.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
