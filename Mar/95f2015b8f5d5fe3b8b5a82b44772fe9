The Kogi State Government has banned the production of charcoal across the 21 local government areas of the state. The state Commissioner for Environment, Victor Omofaiye, disclosed this in a statement sent to journalists on Friday. Omofaiye explained that charcoal production in the state was illegal and highly prohibited. He warned that any person or group of persons caught producing or in possession of the product would be arrested and prosecuted in the court of law. “Any vehicle caught carrying charcoal shall be impounded by the Kogi State Government” the statement added. In a telephone chat with our correspondent on the reason for the ban, the commissioner said it’s a way of preserving the ecosystem by discouraging tree felling. “Are you happy with the way our environment is being degraded? We cannot fold our arms and watch our environment being destroyed for selfish reasons. “Government has a responsibility of taking action to mitigate against environmental degredation,” Omofaye added.
