In its bid to reverse medical tourism, Evercare Hospital, Lekki, has said it will go after Nigerian doctors working in the Diaspora and expatriates in key specialist areas. The hospital, according to a statement said it would do everything within its power to reverse brain drain that had seen many medical practitioners leave for competing health markets offshore. The chief executive officer of the hospital, Rajeev Bhandari, was quoted to have spoken during the first anniversary of the health facility held recently in Lagos. He said, “Since debuting operations in Nigeria a year ago, we have worked towards building a system that creates locally the quality of opportunities that health experts seek abroad. About 10 per cent of our workforce comprises expatriates who are dedicated to staff up-skilling, while we also have partnership plans with foreign bodies on various training. The executive director of the hospital, Temi Awogboro, said the health facility’s aim was to create an avenue of new talents and provide incentives to bring home experienced Nigerians working abroad. “We came into the market with the ambition to convert what has been historically a brain drain into a brain gain. And we felt with a combination of the infrastructure, the equipment and best-in-class focused on quality outcomes that we could start to re-divert some of the doctors that have left Nigeria back to Nigeria and we are increasingly seeing that,” Awogboro said. The Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, stressed the need for increased private sector participation.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
