Policemen of the Osun State Command have returned the money they extorted from students of the Obafemi Awolowo University, OAU, Ile-Ife. This was made known in a statement signed by the Chairman, National Association of University Students, Osun State Chapter, Eruobami Ayobami, on Monday. NAUS stated that the policemen invaded the Modomo area in Ile-Ife at about 6am on Friday 11th March 2022, and extorted some students in the community. Ayobami stated that the association paid a courtesy visit to the State Commissioner of Police, Olawale Olokode, and impressed on the CP the need for the Command to get rid of the bad eggs within the Force. The statement read, “It is unfortunate that some men of the Osun police command invaded Modomo community last week Friday, harassed and extorted some student of the sum of N150,000. “Although, the money has been returned on Monday the incident is a great disservice to the police force. Hence, while on a visit to the CP, Olawale Olokode, we insisted that he get rid of bad elements within the force. “The command is really trying its best to rid the state of criminality, hence, those giving it a bad image must be dealt with seriously to deter others from perpetrating the same act.” Copyright PUNCH.
