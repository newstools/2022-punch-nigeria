The popular Africa Magic Viewers Choice Awards is back with a twist. This year’s edition of the awards ceremony will hold for eight days as opposed to the one day event that had been held in the past. The awards show, which is in its eight year, was last held in 2020. It did not take place in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The event will run from Saturday, May 7, 2022, to Saturday, May 14, 2022. According to the organisers, May 7 has been designated as the AMVCA Opening night. This will be followed by a runway show on May 8 in partnership with BellaNaija Style, tagged, ‘Design for the Stars’, and will feature a competition for budding fashion designers. May 9 will be dedicated to the Multichoice Talent Factory, and will include movie screenings and panel discussions by students of the MTF academy. May 10 is for ‘Africa Magic Session with Content Creators’, where industry stakeholders and enthusiasts will be hosted to a special ‘Africa Magic Content Market Day’. To make it an all-encompassing show, May 11 has been tagged, ‘Pan-African Food Festival and Cultural Day’; while May 12 will be solely for digital content creators. A special gala will then be held on Friday, May 13, for award nominees; while the grand finale of the ceremony will hold on Saturday, May 14, 2022. According to the Head of Content, Africa Magic, Busola Tejumola, $500m will be made available for the development of indigenous content in the course of five years. The ‘Best Soundtrack’ category winner will also go home with N1m. Actors, Adesua Etomi-Wellington and Daniel Effiong will unveil the nominees on Saturday, March 19, 2022. Copyright PUNCH.
