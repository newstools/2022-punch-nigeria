The Imo State Government has said that it did not declare a public holiday in the state on Monday as most people remained at home with schools, banks and most businesses shut. This is coming as a letter circulated online warning people to sit at home on Monday in the state. A statement issued by the state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, urged people to go about their legitimate businesses without fear of molestation. The statement assured people and the residents of the state of the government’s preparedness to safeguard lives and property. It ordered civil servants to report to duties, warning that absentees would be sanctioned. The statement read, “This is to inform all indigenes and residents of Imo State that government has not authorised any public holiday or sit at home across the state, either today, Monday, March 21, 2022, or any other working day. “Consequently, everyone is advised to go about his or her normal duties. “Civil servants are particularly advised to ensure that they are in their offices discharging their responsibilities. Those who abstain from duty without authorisation will be sanctioned accordingly. “Government hereby assures all indigenes and residents of adequate security as they go about their lawful activities.” Copyright PUNCH.
