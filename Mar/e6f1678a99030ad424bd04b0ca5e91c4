The Afun Community, Akure, Ondo, has appealed for a N12m fund to enable 38-year-old Abiodun Adewumi go through a kidney transplant. A medical report signed by a Consultant Nephrologist at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Dr Y.R Raji, and made available to our correspondent, read partly, “Adewumi Ganiyu was reviewed at the Nephrology Clinic of Medical Outpatient Department of the University College Hospital, Ibadan on 17th May 2010. He has requested this medical report to support his fundraising efforts towards his care at our facility. Kindly assist him accordingly.” A statement signed by the president, Afun Community, Dr Adeyinka Adefolarin, read, “we solicit your financial assistance towards the kidney transplant for Adewumi Ganiyu. He was diagnosed with chronic renal disease in 2010 and has been receiving treatment at University College Hospital, Ibadan, since then. He is currently having dialysis three times a week. This has cost the family a lot of money necessitating this appeal. “He currently needs to undergo a kidney transplant for a more permanent solution, this will require over N12m as shown by the cost estimation from UCH. There is a willing kidney donor but the family cannot afford the procedure.” “The patient account details are Zenith Bank, Account name: Adewumi Ganiyu Abiodun, Account number: 2456221532.
