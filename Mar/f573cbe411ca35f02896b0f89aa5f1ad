The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), is meeting with members of the Progressive Governors’ Forum led by their Chairman, Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State. The meeting is holding at the Council Chambers, the State House. Buhari is also expected to meet with the seven aspirants vying for the office of national chairman of the All Progressives Congress at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. They include Niger-East lawmaker, Senator Sani Musa; a former governor of Nasarawa State, Tanko Al-Makura; a former governor of Benue State, George Akume; an ex-governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari; another former governor of Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Adamu; Saliu Mustapha and Mohammed Etsu. The aspirants had earlier been screened by the Masari-led screening committee which took place at the Katsina State Governor’s Lodge, Asokoro, Tuesday at 10pm. Although the nitty-gritty of Wednesday’s meeting couldn’t be officially confirmed as of the time of filing this report, it is believed that the President will either disclose his consensus plans or allow an open race.
