The Resident Electoral Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission in Niger State, Professor Sam Egwu, has revealed that the Internally Displaced Persons in the state will vote in the camps during the forthcoming general elections. Egwu stated this on Monday in Minna during a stakeholders meeting with political parties and security agencies in the state. The REC stated that provisions were being made for the 14 Local Government Areas of the state ravished by insecurity to vote in the camps if security situation in the state didn’t improve before 2023 general elections. He said, “We have security challenges in 14 Local Government Areas, but it is more pronounced in Shiroro, Munya and Rafi Local Government Areas.” Egwu also said that legible votes from 270 polling units have been displaced from their homes of which 46 polling units were from Munya LGA, 100 from Mariga, and 62 each from Shiroro and Rafi. He said the commission has mapped out strategies to enable IDPs exercise their franchise during the forthcoming 2023 general election, adding that replacement of PVCs for IDPs who have lost their PVCs has commenced. Egwu also added that if the security situation does not improve, the voters in Shiroro Local Government would have to travel to Minna, the State Capital to vote, after which the results would be taken back to Shiroro LGA.
