The Managing Director of Fidelity Bank, Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe, has explained how more Nigerian women can attain leadership positions. According to her, the recommendations are against the backdrop of the fact that in Nigeria and beyond women occupy only a few leadership positions in the government and corporate organizations. She said statistics had shown that, “Though women constitute 49 per cent of the Nigerian population, we have only four per cent of female lawmakers. Also out of 26 banks in the country, there are only six female bank MDs.” The MD disclosed this while speaking at the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry 2022 International Women’s Day Celebration titled “Breaking the Ice”. To “break the ice” in career and entrepreneurship, she noted that women must work hard, invest in their personal development, constantly upskill and gain deep knowledge of their industry. She also emphasised the need to educate the girl child in society. “Finally, it is also extremely important that we create enabling environments for women to thrive and maximise their full potential,” she added Copyright PUNCH.
