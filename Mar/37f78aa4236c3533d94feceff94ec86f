The Lagos State Commissioner for Education, Mrs Folasade Adefisayo has advised students in the state to exhibit good character in their respective schools. Adefisayo made this call in a statement on Wednesday. She was quoted to have said this when she received students who emerged winners of the 2022 National Junior Engineers, Technicians and Scientists competition in Alausa, Ikeja. She said, “Be more versatile, dynamic, problem solvers and critical thinkers while maximising the available career opportunities open to you. “You are not just leaders of tomorrow but leaders of today; therefore you must start practising leadership, shun all limitations and show your greatness to the world. “Exhibit good character and distinguish yourselves as good ambassadors by abstaining from all social vices and bad conduct in your respective schools.” The Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Mr Abayomi Abolaji, noted that the government would create more opportunities for students. “The state government has continued to create an enabling environment for learning, thereby creating opportunities for students to develop their intellectual capacity,” he said.
