Modele Sarafa-Yusuf, a former Special Adviser on Communication to Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has declared to contest for the Ogun state governorship seat in 2023 elections. Sarafa-Yusuf, an ace sports broadcaster, made her declaration at the Osoba Adire Kampala International Market, Asero, Abeokuta, on Wednesday. Addressing newsmen after her declaration, the former media aide to Abiodun said she is in the race to encourage other women in politics to make their intention known by declaring for various political positions. She said “I want to be a transformative and inclusive leader and to make Ogun the state of choice for people to live, work, and play because of the educational, economic, and cultural opportunities; safety, livability, vibrancy, and connectedness. “I’m not running because I’m a woman, I’m running because I’m capable and because I know I can do the job. “I also think, women who have something to offer should step forward and make the country better,” she said. When asked why she was running against her former boss, Sarafa-Yusuf claimed she was running for the governorship post since the governor had not declared his intention to run for a second term. She said, “The governor has not told me he is running, if people can go around and say things, and declare on behalf of a politician, it’s up to the politician to say, I want to run, step up to the place and he has not said so as far as I know.” Copyright PUNCH.
