The immediate past Chairman of the Freight Forwarders Registration Committee of the Council for the Regulation of Freight Forwarding in Nigeria, Mrs Chi Eze, has said the number of freight forwarders in the nation has witnessed over 60 per cent growth in four years. She disclosed this during a press briefing. She said, “As the chairman of CRFFN Registration Committee, I was able to create awareness through multiple programmes to increase the number of freight forwarders registered by CRFFN. “I don’t have the current figures in terms of new registrations at the moment but the increase is more than 60 per cent.” According to Eze, being the first woman to serve on the Governing Board of CRFFN was a great and rewarding venture. She added, “I was privileged to serve as the first woman on the Governing Board of CRFFN during the last administration. It was a great experience for me. Women are better managers of resources and people. We are naturally better mediators and problem solvers. “This was a role I played at the last governing board because there were issues that could have divided the board but I collaborated with the men to nip some of these problems in the bud.”  Copyright PUNCH.
