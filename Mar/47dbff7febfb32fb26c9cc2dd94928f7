A Peoples Democratic Party presidential aspirant, Dele Momodu, has alleged that the “Federal Government is deliberately uninterested” in fixing the electricity problems confronting the nation. The Federal Government, according to Momodu, created so many bureaucracies around the power sector that made it “practically impossible to revamp and improve electricity supply” in the country. Momodu said this on Tuesday in Maiduguri when he paid a condolence visit to his ally in Borno State. Speaking to journalists, the PDP presidential aspirant disclosed that he had made efforts in the past to help the APC-led government fix the power problem but the government did not show the commitment to address the issue. “I called the minister of power and introduced them to experts that will help fix the electricity problem and they held a meeting but since that meeting, the minister refused to allow them to sit again. There are a lot of cabals around the government. “I hate that word – the cabal; they are the ones that hold the power sector. The determination of one leader to succeed where others failed will change the bureaucracy holding the power sector. “I have the knowledge and solutions to fix the power sector problem,” he said.
