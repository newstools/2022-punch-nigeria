Popular Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh, has on Wednesday stated that she was not ashamed to be weak. This was as she added that it was okay for one to question God and lose trust and love for Him. According to her, so many people were in the stage of unbelief in the things of God and she wasn’t ashamed that she was weak at this time because she knew it was just for a while. In her Instagram story, she wrote, “It is okay to lose your trust and love for God! It is okay to question God! It is okay to stop believing. “You know why? Because God never created us in his image nor likeness. At least, not literally. “The only one who is not allowed to give up is the God himself. He created us with the power of choice. Whatever rocks your boat, do it. “I have seen more unbelievers enjoy earth than my Christian brethren. What’s th guarantee that heaven is real? (I woke up with some dangerous thoughts). “God doesn’t need anyone to defend him. Hateful words or disappointing words wouldn’t stop me from saying or feeling more. “I’m too STUBBORN. Let God himself do the defense through his touch while if you care too much, just pray because I’m not alone in this stage (Check on your parents/ loved ones). “We have so many broken men and women today make up our society because they have been thought to hide these feelings, because God is supreme. “Bullshit my Bible says He’s my father, my friend. I’m not ashamed to be weak for I know I would not be here too long!” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
