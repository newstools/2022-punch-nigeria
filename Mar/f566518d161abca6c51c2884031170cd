Ahead of the March 26 National Convention of the All Progressives Congress, the daughter of Moshood Kashimawo Abiola, the late philanthropist, ‘Rinsola Abiola, formalised her bid to vie for the position of the position of the national youth leader of the party. Miss Abiola obtained the nomination form on Thursday at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja in the company of a large team of supporters drawn from across the country. If elected, she would become the first young woman to emerge as the national youth leader of a political party in the country. Her campaign urged members to seize the chance to make history and brighten the party’s progressive ideals. Her supporters described her as one who was committed to the attainment of social justice through the meaningful inclusion of youths and women in leadership. Abiola has since expressed her gratitude to her supporters and others who have identified with her aspiration since she made it public. She also offered assurances that if elected, she would protect the interest of young progressives and mobilise for votes for the party. “It’s a promise many have observed she is well-positioned to deliver on given her extensive network and collaboration with leading youth voices across different sectors. “As a prominent youth voice in the APC, she has served on various youth committees of the party and led various campaigns to expand the party’s membership strength and increase its appeal amongst young people. “A certified PR professional, Miss Abiola’s legislative and policy experience, having served in the Eighth Assembly as an aide to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, has increased the confidence of her supporters that as National Youth Leader,” they said.
