Following his match-winning performance against Udinese, Napoli manager Luciano Spalletti has showered encomium on Nigeria international Victor Osimhen, after helping the Italian outfit claim a 2-1 victory at the Diego Maradona Stadium on Saturday. Napoli came back from a goal down after Gerard Deulofeu gave the visitors the lead midway into the opening period, but Osimhen produced a man-of-the-match performance as his brace ensured Spalleti’s men won the game to keep their hope of winning the Serie A title alive. The former Lille forward nodded Mario Ruis free-kick in to give the hosts the equaliser seven minutes after the restart. The 23-year-old completed the comeback when he met Giovanni Di Lorenzo’s low cross with a cool finish to secure all three points for Il Partenopei. Speaking after the game, Spalletti said the Nigerian deserved more praise than he was getting from fans. “He is a footballer who manages to go beyond his limit,” Spalletti was quoted as saying by tuttonapoli.net. “When you think he is at his maximum potential, he manages to give an extra boost. He is a strong footballer, but you don’t push him too far. We don’t pay him enough compliments.” Osimhen’s brace against Udinese is the second the Nigerian has scored in seven days as he netted both goals Napoli’s 2-1 win against Verona.  Copyright PUNCH.
