The Chief Executive Officer of Tesla, Elon Musk, has challenged Russian President, Vladimir Putin to a duel with Ukraine at stake. “I hereby challenge Владимир Путин (Vladmir Putin) to single combat,” Musk wrote on Twitter. “The stakes are Україна (Ukraine).” In response to Musk, a tweep @KasiaKomorowicz asked, “Did you think this through? Or am i missing something?” Musk responded by stating that he was “absolutely serious.” Tagging the President’s official page, @KremlinRussia_E, Musk wrote in Russian, “Do you agree to this fight?” Musk’s challenge to Putin came as Russia continued its invasion of Ukraine. Russian troops entered Ukraine on February 24th, after weeks of camping along the country’s border. The 19-day war has resulted in the deaths of thousands of civilians, and the destruction of Ukrainian cities. Despite the fact that peace talks are scheduled for Monday, the Russian army continues to aim for Kyiv, the country’s capital. Following a request from Ukraine’s Vice President, Mykhailo Fedorov, the tech mogul dispatched SpaceX’s Starlink Satellite stations in support of the Ukrainian people. On Saturday, it was reported that a second shipment of Starlink stations had been delivered to the war-torn country, as Musk had earlier promised. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
