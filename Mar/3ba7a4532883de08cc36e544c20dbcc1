Chidinma Ojukwu, the prime suspect in the murder of Super TV CEO, Michael Ataga, and other inmates participated in a beauty pageant held in Kirikiri correctional facility. Viral reports and photos online noted that the 21-year-old murder suspect emerged as the winner of the beauty pageant, which was held to mark the 2022 International Women’s Day. Photos also showed other female inmates who contested in the pageant, all dressed in dinner gowns with sashes supposedly representing their prison wards. The Lagos State Command of the Nigerian Prison Service confirmed to the PUNCH that several activities took place in commemoration of the IWD in the Female Custodial Facility of the prison. The Public Relations Officer of the Command, Rotimi Oladokun, said, “The inmates at Female Custodial Facility commemorated International Women’s Day. There were a series of event: talkshows, talent show, music, comedy, and beauty pageant.” Commenting on the emergence of Chidinma as Miss Cell, Oladokun said, “I can’t comment on a particular winner because there were many winners. Cell A may decide to sing, Cell B may decide to do beauty pageant, while Cell C may decide to present a play. “Maybe her own cell decided to present a pageant show and she won as a representative there. But as I said, there are other winners.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
