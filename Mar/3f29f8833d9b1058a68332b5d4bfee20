A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party and the chairman, Bukola Saraki Presidential Contact and Advocacy Committee, Iyorwuese Hagher, has called on Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State to stop intimidating PDP members in the state for not joining the All Progressives Congress. Iyorwuese, who was in Gusau, the state capital on Tuesday for a contact and advocacy visit in respect of Saraki’s presidential aspiration said, “People cannot be ruled by force”. He stated, “The fact is that you cannot rule people by force, you cannot rule people by intimidation or blackmail. “You cannot use intimidation in democracy to force people to be members of your party. This is specifically what the APC government is doing in this state of Zamfara.” “We are aware that for three times the APC government wanted to pull down the PDP headquarters in Zamfara because the deputy governor did not decamp to APC with the governor.” He frowned on the removal of the Deputy Governor, Mahdi Gusau, from office, describing the process as an abuse of the judicial system. He said, “The flagrant abuse of due process and the ridiculous extent to which they want to reduce the judiciary of this country is unacceptable to Nigerian people.” According to him, the country was not happy with the removal of the deputy governor, adding that Nigerians were behind the Zamfara people. He advised the people of the state to make sure that only people of unquestionable integrity were elected in the 2023 general elections. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
