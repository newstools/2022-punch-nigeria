There was a bit of drama at the All Progressives Congress 2022 National Convention in the early hours of Sunday after a national women leader aspirant, Mary Eta, refused to step down for the party-endorsed aspirant, Betty Edu. After declaring Adamu Abdullahi national chairman of the APC, Chairman of the Convention Electoral sub-committee, Governor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State, had proceeded to give conceding aspirants to openly pull out of the race with respect to the unity list released hours earlier. Eta, who was earlier in the audience at Eagles Square, Abuja, stormed the stage just as the party Chairman for Cross River State, Alphonsus Eba, announced her withdrawal from the race in favour of Edu. She, however, reaffirmed her candidacy, maintaining that no one would concede on her behalf. Eta, who is a representative of South-South women on the board of trustees of the governing party, is a former Director-General of the National Centre for Women Development under the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.)’s regime.
