The Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development in Akwa Ibom State, Dr Ini Adiakpan, has secured bail for six inmates across the three senatorial districts of the state. The beneficiaries who were convicted for minor offences were initially given options of fines of N60,000 but they could not pay and were remanded in custody for over one year. A statement by the Public Relations Officer of the state corrections service, Ogbajie Ogbajie, on Sunday said that the commissioner’s action was in fulfilment of the promise she made when she visited the correctional centres in the state recently. Ogbajie further stated that those qualified for the gesture were inmates who committed minor and bailable offences but did not have money to settle the fine. He further said the commissioner while paying the fine advised the beneficiaries to steer clear of activities that would bring them back to the custodial centres. “Out of love for human development and rehabilitation, the Hon. Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Welfare, Dr Ini Adiakpan, has facilitated the release from custody of some indigent inmates convicted of minor offences and were remanded in different custodial centres in the state. “The act was in fulfilment of the promise she made during her visit to correctional centres in the state recently,’’ the statement read in part. Two of the released inmates, Aniekan Samuel and Akaninyene Sampson, said they were convicted for stealing clothes but were unable to pay the N60,0000 fine imposed by the court.
