Transport situation got worse in Ilorin, Kwara state on Tuesday as scarcity of petroleum products persisted in the state. Residents of the state expressed worry over the lingering fuel scarcity that has affected their daily lives. Many petrol stations locked the gates of their outlets with only Bovas and NNPC stations selling fuel to motorists at the control price of N162 per liter amidst long queues. The PUNCH gathered that fuel was being sold at between N350 to N500 per litre in some other petrol stations, also operating as black market sellers at night. As a result of fuel scarcity, transport fare has increased by more than 300 percent for both inter and intra city transport. In Ilorin metropolis, commercial vehicles now charge between N150 and N300 for short distance trip instead of N50 fare previously charged while intercity journey from Ilorin to Offa and Omu-Aran now cost between N800 to N1000 and N1,500 respectively instead of N300 and N800 being previously charged. A motorist, Sunday Adetunji, told our correspondent that the fuel scarcity has continued to take its toll on the transport sector as they now charge commuters according to the fuel price that they bought. Adetunji said, “The present increase in the transport fare is not deliberately caused by commercial drivers. We calculate the fare based on the price of petrol that we buy from the black market. “Today, I bought five litres of petrol from security men at N2000 which is N400 per litre. “Petrol scarcity has also affected the price of food stuff and soup ingredients in the market. We are appealing to the Federal government and the NNPC to help us find a solution to this issue of petrol price.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
