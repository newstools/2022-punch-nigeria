The police have arrested five members of a robbery gang reportedly based in Lagos State while terrorising Iperu/Sagamu/Ode-Remo areas of Ogun State. The suspects – Moruf Abidogun, Usman Adeyemi, Fisayo Aliu, Afees Adesina and Dauda Lekan – were arrested on Saturday following a distress call received by the Iperu Divisional Police Officer. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this on Monday in a statement. Oyeyemi said the hoodlums were operating along Ogere Road, where they were dispossessing members of the public of their belongings. He said, “Upon the distress call, the DPO, Iperu division, SP Waheed Oni, quickly mobilised his men in conjunction with the area command’s anti-robbery team, Sagamu anti-robbery team and Ogere patrol team, and moved to the scene. “On sighting the policemen, the hoodlums, who had already snatched a Toyota Corolla with number plate, GGE 733 FL, took to their heels. But they were hotly chased by the policemen and five of them were apprehended. “Preliminary investigation revealed that the gang members are based in Lagos, but they come to Iperu for operations because one of them is residing in the town. “We recovered from them one locally-made pistol and a Toyota Corolla with number plate, GGE 733FL.” The PPRO said the state Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, had ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for discreet investigation.
