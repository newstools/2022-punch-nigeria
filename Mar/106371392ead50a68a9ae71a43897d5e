The United Kingdom Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has said, on Monday, that British troops would not be deployed to fight Russian forces in Ukraine. Johnson stated that recent military reinforcements were “nothing more than defensive measures,” the Cable News Network reports. Speaking during a visit to Estonia’s Tapa Military Base, alongside NATO Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, and Estonian Prime Minister, Kaja Kallas, Johnson said, “I want to be crystal clear on that point: We will not fight Russian forces in Ukraine. “As we support the people of Ukraine, we must also shore up our shared resilience to protect our people and our values. These are nothing more than defensive measures, which have been the essence of NATO for more than 70 years.” He also added, “Our reinforcements, like these reinforcements here in Tapa, are firmly within the borders of NATO members, and they are profoundly the right thing to do,” according to CNN.
