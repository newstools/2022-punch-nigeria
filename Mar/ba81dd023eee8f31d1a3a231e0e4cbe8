In the spirit of the season of love, the Academic Staff Union of Universities on February 14 commenced a “four-week roll-over, total and comprehensive strike action” over the failure of the Federal Government to fully implement the Memorandum of Action it signed with the Union on December 23, 2020. ASUU is angry that the draft report of the renegotiated 2009 FGN/ASUU agreement which has been submitted to the Federal Government for finalisation and signing has been delayed for over nine months. ASUU is unhappy with the Federal Government’s delay tactic in the adoption of the University Transparency and Accountability Solution and the forceful payment of salaries and emoluments of her members through the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System. On March 9, 2020, ASUU began an indefinite strike to ask the government to revitalise public universities with funding, pay arrears of earned academic allowances from 2013 to date, pay salary shortfall, halt the proliferation of state universities, make FG constitute visitation panels to her universities to assess governance challenges, ensure Federal Government constitute 2009 FGN/ASUU renegotiation committee, get the government to adopt UTAS and get withheld salaries paid to members as well as ensure that deducted but un-remitted check-off union dues are paid to union accounts. The Federal Government failed to use the period of lockdown to engage the union until it was time for students to return to school. By December 22, 2020, ASUU, considered the implorations from parents and other stakeholders and signed a Memorandum of Action with timelines to each item in the agreement assigned. On the re-constitution of the 2009 FGN/ASUU re-negotiation committee, it was agreed that the committee would be inaugurated on December 2, 2020 and given eight weeks to conclude its work. The renegotiation that was supposed to last eight weeks didn’t end until May 2021 because some members of the Federal Government team contracted COVID-19 and the process was until they recovered. However, months after the submission of the renegotiated agreement, the Federal Government has been dribbling the union against their promise to “implement without delay” as contained in the 2020 MoA. No professor in Nigerian public universities earn $1000 monthly; Assistant lecturer earn between N118,277 and N137, 334; Lecturer II has a doctorate degree (N129, 724 – N153, 563); Lecturer I has at least three years post-PhD experience on the job (N160, 809 – N203, 778); Senior Lecturer with at least six years experience on the job (N222,229 –314, 159); Associate Professor (with at least nine years experience on the job: N277, 179 – N350, 169) and a full Professor with more than 12  years of experience on the job (N332, 833 – 416, 743). This is what they have been earning since 2009. What about the funding for revatilisation? The 2013 MOU stipulates that Nigerian public varsity would need the sum of N1.3tn for a modest revitalisation. The fund was to be paid in tranches of N200bn (2013), N220bn (2014), N220bn (2015), N220bn (2016), N220bn (2017) and N220bn (2018) respectively. Only President Goodluck Jonathan government released N200bn in 2014. It took another strike before the Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) regime released N20bn in 2019.  In the 2020 MoA, government offered to pay N30bn “on or before January 2021.” This was just paid in November/December 2021. This leaves a balance of N170bn to be paid for year 2014. Earned academic allowances are also owed lecturers in public varsities spanning 2013 through 2020. The last disbursement made by the government was only for 2021 because a provision for it was forced to be made in the supplementary budget of 2021. There is also the issue of UTAS. ASUU opposes the use of IPPIS in paying salaries of lecturers because it does not capture the peculiarities of the university system. It developed UTAS. The Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, gave his assurance in 2020 to follow up with the Nigeria Information Technology Development Agency and Ministry of Education to expedite action on the test process and ensure the deployment of the UTAS for the payment of salaries of staff of universities. Lecturers continue to do researches with their money and that is the only grace Nigerian public universities are still enjoying to feature in webometric rankings. When strike happens, students suffer and lecturers whose promotions are due get trapped in it but we must fight and sacrifice. Years ago, ASUU warned that one day, the children of the poor will have nothing left to eat but the children of the rich. This is already happening. The untrained millions of out-of-school children are unleashing the beast the system planted in them through banditry, terrorism, armed robbery, kidnapping among others. Parents and other stakeholders have options to pick from: join government to destroy public funded university education or support ASUU to extract commitment and funding from the government so that children of the masses will have hope of becoming responsible leaders of tomorrow.
