The coach of Black Stars of Ghana, Addo Otto, on Monday, said that his team would surprise Nigeria by securing the 2022 Fédération Internationale de Football Association’s World Cup ticket in the second leg qualifiers in Abuja. Otto made this known to newsmen at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium in Abuja on Monday ahead of Tuesday’s match. He said he was optimistic, that since Black Stars played well in Ghana, they would improve on their performance to secure the ticket at the expense of the home team in the return leg fixture in Abuja. “We have a good team, we played well in Ghana, we will improve on it, we are here to push more, we are determined. “I don’t see myself under pressure, it is a privilege to play Super Eagles in Nigeria, we are not better than Super Eagles and Super Eagles is not better than us. “We are here to improve on our game until we are satisfied with our performance and score some goals,” he said. Speaking on his part, Gideon Mensar, a Black Stars player, said that they would maintain the team spirit in their return match against the Super Eagles. “We will do better than what we did in Kumasi, we are not thinking of qualifiers or qualifying, we must qualify in tomorrow’s match,” Gideon said.
