Verona coach Igor Tudor is ready to put on a show for the fans at the Stadio Bentegodi against Napoli and is not afraid of Victor Osimhen. “He’s not the best striker in Serie A.” That is one of the reasons why Verona are expected a packed house, along with their own recent confidence-boosting results. “Napoli have strong players, Luciano Spalletti is one of my favourite coaches and my players are well aware of what this game means,” said Tudor in his press conference. “They also know there will be a big crowd and they like this, as their hard work has attracted people back to the stadium. They are eager to not let the fans down and put on a show with a great result. “The people of Verona are showing their faith in the whole club. There has to be a strong connection and creates a wonderful atmosphere.” When asked about the fear of facing Napoli hitman Osimhen, Tudor shrugged it off. “He is not the best striker in Serie A, no. He’s one of the best, but for me the best is Dusan Vlahovic. I don’t want to focus too much on Napoli’s strengths and players, because I am concentrating on what Verona can do.” It is not a full-strength Verona squad, as Antonin Barak is injured, while Tudor reveals “some unexpected problems with flu and a few minor knocks. We’ll have 13 or 14 first team players, will bring along a few youth team figures and I am never afraid to play people if they are talented. “Gianluca Frabotta only has about half-an-hour in his legs.”
