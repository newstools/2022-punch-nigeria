A former Senator representing Kaduna Central, Shehu Sani, has revealed that male inmates were denied the opportunity to interact with their female counterparts during his time in Kirikiri prison in 1995. He noted that contrary to what was obtainable now, the male inmates were not allowed to visit the female section nor watch the pageant show by female inmates. Sani, who disclosed this on his Twitter handle on Thursday, noted that in 1995, the male inmates were not allowed to even greet their female neighbours. The former lawmaker who expressed displeasure over the treatment, however, commended the correctional facility’s current staff, whom he said, are “more civilised”. He tweeted, “When we were in Kiri Kiri prison in 1995, they refused to allow us go to the female section to watch the Pageant; even to go and greet them, they would say no. The present correctional staff are more civilised.” The PUNCH had earlier reported that Chidinma Ojukwu, the prime suspect in the murder of Super TV CEO, Michael Ataga, and other inmates participated in a beauty pageant held in Kirikiri correctional facility. Viral reports and photos online showed that the 21-year-old murder suspect emerged as the winner of the beauty pageant, which was held to mark the 2022 International Women’s Day. Photos also showed other female inmates who contested in the pageant, all dressed in dinner gowns with sashes supposedly representing their prison wards. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
