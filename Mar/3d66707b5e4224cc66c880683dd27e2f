An aspirant for the position of the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Senator Sani Musa, has promised to ensure that the party work its policies to support women and youths if given the opportunity at the forthcoming national convention. According to a statement on Sunday, Musa, who currently represents Niger East Senatorial District at the National Assembly, spoke during an interactive session with a cross section of women and youths under the aegis of APC Youths Stakeholders Forum. The statement quoted him as saying that, “I am fully aware of the challenges facing women and youths in Nigeria today and the series of hurdles they have to cross in order to be heard and be given the opportunity to tap their potentials. “Our agenda for women and youths as a party will be within the confines of the party’s formulated policies that will be proposed to the executive arm of government. “Of course, as the head of the party leadership or the National Working Committee, it is imperative on us to think outside the box and compliment government’s existing efforts in the emancipation of women and youths in our society.” “Political parties are essential institutions of democracy and as such, I will be adaptive and committed to building capacity among our women and youths folks and we shall make it a policy of the party.” Musa said just as human capital development will be giving the needed priority under his leadership, the party will work to deliver trainings to volunteers, party leaders and staff members, women and youths among others. He added, “We are firmly aware that women and youths are the least represented amongst the political leadership. Whilst commending President Muhammadu Buhari for signing the ‘Not-too-young-to-run bill’  into law and other initiatives for youths and women participation in politics, as party, one of our strategies is to close the funding gap.”
