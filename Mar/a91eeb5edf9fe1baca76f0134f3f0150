Media personality, Stephanie Coker-Aderinokun, has said some women have no business wishing other women a happy international women’s day. In a post she made on Instagram on Tuesday, the media personality adduced her claim to the prejudices of women against themselves in society, adding that women should stop the act. The post read, “Some women, sorry to say, have no business wishing others a happy international women’s day. Women let’s stop the bias against each other. She looks good doesn’t mean she has a low IQ. “She has her own thriving business doesn’t mean she is a runs girl. She is unmarried doesn’t mean she can’t hang with married folk. She’s older doesn’t mean her time has passed. “She’s young, doesn’t mean she is not knowledgeable. She’s a busy working mother doesn’t mean she isn’t a caring mother. She’s divorced doesn’t mean she’s damaged goods.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
