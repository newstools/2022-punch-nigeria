So, everybody is important in the system. Even when you are dealing with junior staff members, treat them as human beings. ‘The positions we hold today are temporal. I will not remain here forever. I will finish my job as Vice Chancellor and still come back as a staff member and then somebody will become Vice Chancellor and I will bow to the person,” he explained.. Copyright PUNCH.
