The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, has been sued by her half-sister, Samantha Markle over her popular interview with Oprah Winfrey. Samantha, who was suing Meghan for defamation, noted that the ‘rags to royalty’ narrative that the duchess presented about herself was simply false. This is coming barely a year after Meghan spoke out about her life in a now-famous interview with Oprah, which immediately became one of the most extraordinary chapters in recent royal history. In the court document obtained by TMZ, Samantha claimed that Meghan trashed her and spread outright lies in order to talk down on their family members. Samantha pointed out that Meghan told Oprah that she (Meghan) was an only child, whereas they both share the same father, Thomas Markle. According to Samantha, Meghan also lied when she told Oprah that she last saw her (Samantha) “at least 18, 19 years ago and before that, 10 years before that.” Samantha further claimed that Meghan was wrong when she told Oprah that she (Samantha) only changed her surname to Markle after Meghan started dating Harry. Speaking to TMZ about the suit, Meghan’s attorney, Michael Kump, said, “This baseless and absurd lawsuit is just a continuation of a pattern of disturbing behaviour. We will give it the minimum attention necessary, which is all it deserves.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
