The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has taken a swipe at the Peoples Democratic Party, saying the platform failed both as ruling and opposition party. This as he also warned the All Progressives Congress members to learn from the PDP failures by ensuring the ruling party was not consumed by war of attrition and intraparty crises. Buhari also warned APC leaders and members to desist from name-calling and backstabbing ahead of the oncoming March 26 Convention. The President, in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, also urged party faithful to “remain steadfast and maintain its unity if the party is to continue in the path of victory and its dominance at all levels throughout the country.” Warning against intraparty crisis, Buhari asked the APC members to look at the once-powerful, “main opposition” Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) now enfeebled and adrift and learn lessons in disunity, mismanagement, and corruption. ”They failed in 16 years in power and a failure as opposition. ”“Yes, we are entitled to our own share of dissent and intra-party discord. These are common in all parties, left and right all over the world. ”But parties splintered by competing egos destine themselves to the worst possible fate,” the President warned. ”As the country prepares for the long run-up to the 2023 presidential election, we all expect a robust debate on the issues that matter and what is going in the APC should be a reflection of this, not the infighting we are seeing. There must be no more distractions ahead of the convention to choose new leaders.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
