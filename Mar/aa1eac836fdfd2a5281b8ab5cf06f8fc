The Federal Executive Council on Tuesday felicitated with the Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, on the occasion of his 65th birthday. The FEC in a statement by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation described Osinbajo as an outstanding public servant, lawyer, pastor, and the epitome of humility and loyalty in service to the fatherland. The statement partly read, “Prof. Osinbajo’s dexterity in leadership is exemplified in the management of the nation’s economy through the chairing of the National Economic Council (NEC), which has resulted in the economic recovery as well as stabilization of the macroeconomic policies in stimulating growth in the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME), for sustainable growth and development. FEC prays God to continue to shower Osinbajo with good health, protection, and wisdom to enable him to support the leadership of President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd).” Copyright PUNCH.
