Crisis has again engulfed the two warring Zamfara All Progressives Congress factions led by Senator Kabiru Marafa and Governor Bello Mattawale following an alleged slanderous statement made by Matawalle’s supporters against Marafa’s APC Publicity Secretary, Bello Bakyasuwa. The Matawalle Leadership Forum reputed a claim by Bakyasuwa that Mattawale did not perform well as governor. The forum also challenged Bakyasuwa to produce his biological father to show that he was a true indigene of the Maradun Local Government Area of the state. The forum also added that Bakyasuwa was dismissed from the Nigerian Army. But speaking at a press conference, the Senator Marafa Solidarity Forum said Bakyasuwa was the son of Malam Yakubu and grandson of Garba Bakyasuwa. It added that Bakyasuwa voluntarily retired from the Army and was not dismissed as alleged by the Matawalle Leadership Forum. The group stated, “Bakyasuwa is a true son of the soil whose patriotic position scares some individuals who are still afraid of the shadow of their well known abominable parenting”. “Gentlemen of the press, you must have all seen a story emanating from a group called ‘Matawalle Leadership Forum’ in which they ignorantly challenged Hon. Bello Bakyasuwa Maradun to produce his biological father, a challenge that we consider as childish. “But we find it necessary to react with the warning that, “those who live in a glass house should not throw stones.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
