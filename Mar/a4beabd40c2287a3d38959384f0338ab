The Indigenous People of Biafra has condemned the burning of the house of the President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Prof George Obiozor, with a promise to unravel those behind the attack. The group described the act as barbaric, shameful, and disgraceful to Ndigbo. In a statement on Monday, the group’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, said anybody targeting Obiozor was treading on dangerous grounds because he had done nothing to deserve such a devilish and wicked attack. Powerful added that the group would stop at nothing to unravel those behind the attack. He blamed politicians for the ongoing insecurity in the South-East, saying they should be held liable for the destruction of the Ohanaeze leader’s country home. Powerful maintained that saboteurs of the liberation struggle burnt the elder statesman’s house so as to create the impression that Biafra agitators were violent. The statement read in part, “There is no gainsaying to the fact that criminals behind this cowardly act are those against the liberation of Biafra and the release of our leader, Nnamdi Kanu, so as to create the wrong impression that Biafra agitators are violent. “Those behind this evil act have nothing to do with IPOB, the Eastern Security Network or Biafra agitation. They are sponsored criminals and must be made to face the consequences of their actions. “We don’t consider Prof Obiozor as an enemy of IPOB and the Biafra struggle. So, anybody targeting him is treading on dangerous grounds. He has done nothing to deserve such a devilish and wicked attack. “The criminal elements being recruited by evil politicians wreaking havoc across our land should stop their murderous activities or brace for IPOB.” Copyright PUNCH.
