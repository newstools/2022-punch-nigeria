Gunmen suspected to be gang members of late Terwase Akwaza aka Gana on Wednesday attacked Imande Kundi at Mbacher council ward in the Katsina-Ala Local Government Area of Benue State and killed four people, including a tax collector. The incident happened barely four days after bandits attacked a nearby village in the same council ward and killed a community leader and eight mourners. “It is the same Mbacher council ward where they killed a traditional ruler and other eight people that were at a burial ceremony that the bandits attacked this afternoon and killed four people,” a source told our correspondent. Confirming the report, the Chairman of Katsina-Ala Local Government,  Alfred Atera, said the incident had been reported to the Area Commander and Divisional Police Officer in the town. He said, “It is true that some bandits this (Wednesday) afternoon between 2.30 and 3pm attacked the same area where they killed mourners on Saturday and killed four people. “One of the people they killed is a tax collector and I have reported the case to the Area Commander and the DPO of Katsina Ala.” When contacted, the State Police Command’s Public Relations Officer, SP Catherine Anene, could not be reached for comment as calls made to her telephone rang out.
