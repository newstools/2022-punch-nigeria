Gateway United extended their unbeaten run at home to three games after they edged Bendel Insurance 1-0 in a Nigeria National League match-day five encounter at the MKO Abiola Stadium, Abeokuta on Wednesday. Captain Oronsaye James grabbed the match winner for Gateway United in the 61st minute. Toyin Ayinla’s side now lead Group B1 of the Southern Conference with nine points from five games- having lost two away games. Reacting to his side’s victory, Ayinla said it was a hard-fought win, but believes there’s still room for improvement for his team. “We had no other option than to return to winning ways,” Ayinla said after the game. “The boys’ attitude was perfect and they stuck to the game plan. We will continue to wax stronger, no doubt. There’s hardly a perfect game, thus, we will go back to the training pitch to get better. “We wouldn’t want this to get into our heads. So, we will shift our focus to our next game, which is another home game against Osun United. All I can say now is that the absolute best is yet to come.” Gateway United will face Osun United next game at home on match-day six.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
