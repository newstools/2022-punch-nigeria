The Chairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, on Monday, in Abuja resumed his duties at the National Secretariat of the All Progressives Congress. Buni who arrived at the Secretariat on Monday afternoon was greeted to a rousing welcome from workers and management. The PUNCH had reported that Buni was almost supplanted by some top party stakeholders save for the intervention of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), who recognised Buni as CECPC Chairman and asked party leaders and governors to rally behind him. The President also warned against further utterances and actions that could undermine the credibility of the March 26 in the eyes of the electoral watchdog, Independent National Electoral Commission. Meanwhile, the screening of aspirants vying for various party offices at the National Working Committee, Non-NWC and Zonal levels, has yet to begin. Our correspondent gathered that the party is “harmonising” a list of the screening committee as well as those to be screened. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
