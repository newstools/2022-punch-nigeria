The Conference of Nigeria Political Parties has joined women to protest the rejection of bills meant to promote the interest of the female gender by the National Assembly and urged lawmakers to end the habit of taking the country back to the primitive days and revisit the bills. The umbrella body of all registered political parties and associations in the country, on the occasion of the 2022 International Women’s Day, asked members of the Senate to revisit the rejected pro-female bills to align the country with the theme of this year’s IWD celebration. In a statement signed by its Secretary-General, Chief Willy Ezugwu, and made available on Monday, the CNPP maintained that the lawmakers had always failed to flow with the mood of the nation and prevailing international standards at all times, saying the rejection of the gender equity bills was not a surprise. Ezugwu stated, “Recently, our representatives at the National Assembly went against the collective wishes of the people, who elected them, and it took the deafening outcry of Nigerians at home and in the Diaspora to get the National Assembly to pass the bill to allow for electronic transmission of election results. “The reason is that most members of the National Assembly hardly consult their constituents before making decisions that will directly or indirectly impact their lives and livelihoods. “If we are practising democracy, the lawmakers, the executive and their appointees are always in the office to do what the people, who elected them want, not imposing their wishes and ideas on the citizens they represent.” Copyright PUNCH.
