The Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, has called for a united front in the Peoples Democratic Party, saying that is the only way to clinch the presidential seat in 2023. Tambuwal said this at the Sokoto State Governor’s Lodge, Asokoro, Abuja while attending a consultative meeting with chairmen of the 36 state chapters of the party. According to the presidential hopeful, the meeting with chairmen was part of wide consultations in preparation for his formal declaration to vie for the party’s presidential ticket. “Unity of purpose and understanding and working together for us to realise the all-important goal of rescuing Nigeria is very important. “Consultations are ongoing and we will have to comply with the Independent National Electoral Commission’s guidelines as a responsible political party. So nothing stops the consultations from continuing. Our party stands a chance and it is the party to beat in Nigeria today,” he said. Chairman of the Kaduna State chapter of the party, Hassan Hyat, who spoke on behalf of the chairmen told journalists that Tambuwal who is also chairman of the PDP Governors’ Forum called for the meeting to officially disclose to them his intention to run for the Office of the President in 2023. He urged presidential aspirants to remain united with the party’s vision whether or not their bid scales through, saying the Office of the President can only have one occupant at a time. Hyat stated, “We are more interested in the unity of the party as our number one cardinal objective because we believe that the party has to come back to rescue Nigeria and we are asking everybody to join forces.” Copyright PUNCH.
