As Nigeria prepare to face Ghana for the World Cup play-off, former presidential aide, Reno Omokri, has warned the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to desist from calling the Super Eagles ahead of the crucial encounter. The aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan made this statement on his official Twitter page Tuesday. Buhari came under attack in January following Nigeria’s shock exit at the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon after a phone call to the players to wish them well and charged them to continue making Nigerians proud. Prior to the call from Buhari, Nigeria had progressed to the round of 16, after three straight victories against Egypt, Sudan, and Guinea Bissau in Group D, but crashed out in their next game, a round of 16 clash against Tunisia. A section of Nigerian fans stated on social media that Buhari’s call brought ill-luck to the squad, which caused the defeat. Reno took to social media to appeal to the President and suggested instead that he called their opponents the Black Stars. “Dear General Buhari,” he wrote. “The only appeal I make to you as Nigeria is set to face Ghana in a World Cup qualifier is please do NOT call the Super Eagles. “If you want to call I can get you the number of the Black Stars, you may wish to call them to ‘inspire them’.
