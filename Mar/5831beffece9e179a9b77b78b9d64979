As the war in Ukraine entered its fourth week on Thursday, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had already crossed all known red lines in the ongoing war. In a live interview with the NBC News, on Thursday, Zelensky lashed out on the West for not doing enough to stop Russia. Asked if the use of nuclear weapons would mean that Russia had crossed the red line, Zelensky said Russia began to cross red lines the moment its troop began to kill Ukrainian civilians and children. He explained that World War III had already begun and world leaders should not wait until Ukraine had fallen. Over 3 million refugees have fled from Ukraine since three weeks ago when the war began. Zelensky said no one knew when or how the war would end. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
