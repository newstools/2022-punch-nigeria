One person, suspected to be a member of an armed robbery gang, has been killed by policemen from the Delta State Police Command after a failed attack on a Point of Sale operator in the Osubi-Orerokpe area of the state. City Round learnt that a police patrol team attached to ‘B’ Division, Warri, while on a routine patrol along Okere Market junction, Warri, intercepted the four-man gang operating with a minibus with registration number, Delta DSZ 912 XA. On sighting the police team, the hoodlums were said to have shot at them and zoomed off. The police team engaged them in a shootout and chased them all the way to MacCaiver Market. However, on getting to the market, the police were said to have ceased fire due to the crowd while the hoodlums jumped out of their vehicle and fled into the crowd. One of the suspects, one Christopher, who was arrested with gunshot injuries, confessed to being a member of the armed robbery gang that robbed a POS operator at Osubi-Orerokpe earlier in the day. He was, however, said to have died while receiving treatment at the General Hospital, Warri. Confirming the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe, disclosed that the minibus used by the gangsters, one expended cartridge, two POS machines, two female bags containing two Zenith Bank ATM cards, one driver’s licence, one power bank and a Bible were recovered from the hoodlums.
