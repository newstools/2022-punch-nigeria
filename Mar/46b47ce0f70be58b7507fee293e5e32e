Nigeria Chess Federation president, DIG Sani Mohammed (retd.), has reiterated his commitment to the development of chess in the country stating that a system is in place to ensure chess games are duly rated, The PUNCH reports. Mohammed returned as the president of the federation on a third term ticket after all the candidates in the Nigeria Chess Federation race reached a consensus to adopt without a vote the candidacy of Mohammed as the federation’s president for the next four years. Nigeria chess players have on many occasions complained about their welfares and not having some of their games rated by FIDE. However, speaking with The PUNCH, Mohammed said plans are in place to ensure there is an improvement in the chess games in the country with committees mandated to carry out the plans. He said, “Committees have been formed with mandates given to ensure. The issue of rating of games has been mandated to the technical committee who are to ensure that games are duly rated. “In order to assist the technical committee to design technical programmes for coaches and even players, I hereby propose a standard model of decision making. The model is known as the rational model, which allows the committee to use a four-step sequence when making decisions.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
