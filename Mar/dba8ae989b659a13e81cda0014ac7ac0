The Chief Executive Officer, Jive Technologies, Omaghomi John, has emphasised the relevance of driving the education sector with technology. He said this while explaining his motivation for creating Jive Technologies. He said, “COVID-19 has made it more expedient for Nigerians to embrace software programmes like JSAMS. Jive is big on privacy policy and all information processed on the software programme is not shared with third parties.” According to him, JSAMS solves the security and quality control problems of schools, with a clock-in and clock-out integrated system for students and teachers which helps to monitor and avoid discrepancies of appearance. Teachers can post assignments online for students or upload lesson notes so that students can download and read ahead of the class, he said. John said Jive started as a means of eradicating paperwork from schools and solving educational challenges using technology. Just as teachers struggle to input assignment and exam scores as well as keep a daily register, likewise, he observed that many parents struggle to keep up with their children’s attendance in school, their assignments, and even examination results. Going further, he said, “We found out that using paper to compute results was very stressful and might affect the teachers’ ability to teach. “So, we came up with this programme to help teachers automate the process of computing their results, remotely and in a stress-free way. From feedback, users refer to the software as impeccable and seamless.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
