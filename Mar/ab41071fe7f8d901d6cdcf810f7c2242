At least one person has been confirmed dead and six others, including a nine-month-old baby, sustained injuries following a clash between operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency and hoodlums in the ATC area of Jalingo, the Taraba State capital. The spokesman for the Taraba State Police Command, ASP Usman Abdullahi, who confirmed the incident to our correspondent on the phone, said the injured were receiving treatment at the Federal Medical Centre in Jalingo. The incident, according to Abdullahi, happened when men of the NDLEA, acting on intelligence, raided an area known as a haven for dealers of illicit drugs and were resisted by the hoodlums who attacked them with stones and attempted to disarm them. “Sensing that their lives were in danger, the NDLEA personnel acted in self-defence leading to the death of one person, while six others sustained injuries. “The corpse of the deceased has been deposited at the federal medical centre, while the injured are also receiving treatment,” he said. Efforts to get the reaction of the NDLEA spokesperson in Taraba failed as his phone lines were switched off, at the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
