45-YEAR-OLD Joseph Faduri has declared his interest in the 2023 presidential election, saying it is time for Nigerian youths to rise and take over from old politicians who he said have failed the country. According to a statement made available to The PUNCH on Sunday, Faduri declared his interest to contest the presidential election on the platform of the New Nigeria People’s Party at an event in Abuja. The aspirant, who claimed he is not a politician, said he decided to join the race to restore the nation’s lost glory. He said, “I bring hope to the many hopeless Nigerians; I bring hope again to many Nigerians both home and abroad who have lost hope in this nation. Our country can still be great again. “We can fix our electricity and cut our problems in half. We can fix so many problems of this nation only if we have a sincere, dedicated, good, vibrant and young leader who has the love of his nation and people at heart.” While stressing the need for youths to take over, Faduri said, “No doubt, our fathers have failed this nation and it is time for them to drop the baton. They have run the race and failed us; it is time for us, the youth of this nation to rise up. “It is time to sacrifice something for this nation. This suffering must stop. Enough is enough.” The aspirant also told Nigerian youths that the protests they have embarked on in the past are enough, saying it is time for action. He said the right protest now should be done by voting in the right leaders. “We have protested for so long as youths and patriots of this nation since the time of the Ogonis and we are still protesting. We will no longer protest on the streets, but with our PVC to vote the right leadership,” he said.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
