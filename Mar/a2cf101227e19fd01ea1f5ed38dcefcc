THE Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria has criticised private depot owners over the recent increase in the pump price of Premium Motor Spirit, also known as petrol, in some states. According to reports, some independent marketers are still selling petrol between N180 and N200 per litre in their respective filling stations especially in Lagos and its environs. As a result, the IPMAN National President, Mr Chinedu Okoronkwo, on Tuesday said that “some of the private depot owners had not reduced their ex-price for PMS.” According to him, some members of the association are still buying the product at higher ex-depot prices. This, he said, was the reason some marketers were still selling more than the approved pump price of N165, the News Agency of Nigeria reported. “IPMAN is appealing to the government and relevant authorities to engage these depot owners to revert to the old price regime so that there will be some kind of uniformity in the price of petrol.” Okoronkwo noted that the scarcity of PMS experienced across the country in the past few weeks was almost coming to an end. Furthermore, he advised the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited to increase the volume of products being supplied to Port Harcourt, Calabar and other coastal areas to ensure a smooth distribution. On the compensation of motorists affected by the imported off-spec petrol, he said IPMAN members were still compiling the list which would be subjected to scrutiny. Okoronkwo said, “We are compiling the list and very soon marketers will present it to the relevant government agencies. “We want to make sure that some unscrupulous persons don’t take advantage of the situation to exploit the government.
