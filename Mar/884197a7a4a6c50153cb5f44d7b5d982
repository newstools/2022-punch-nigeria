DataPro, a technology-driven credit rating agency, has in its latest report assigned FHA Mortgage Bank Limited a long-term rating of “BBB” with a stable outlook for the year 2021/2022. The “BBB” indicates slight risk. It also shows fair financial strength, operating performance and business profile when compared to the standard established by DataPro. “This company, in our opinion, has the ability to meet its ongoing obligations, but its financial strength is vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions,” DataPro said in a statement on Monday. The credit rating agency said its Rating Committee approved the rating after an assessment of the company’s financial performance, capital adequacy, asset quality, liquidity, profitability, corporate governance and risk management, as well as risk factors of its current healthy profile in the medium to long-term period. It also stressed the bank’s generated earnings from interest and non-interest sources which contributed 38 per cent growth in gross earnings during the year 2020. The bank’s operating expenses also grew marginally by three per cent from N469m (Yr. 19) to N481m (Yr. 20). The rating of FHA Mortgage Bank Limited is supported by the bank’s leverage on the capacity of its parent body. FHA Mortgage Bank Limited had a short-term rating of “A2” which indicates fair credit quality and adequate capacity for timely payment of financial commitments. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
