Osun State Governor Gboyega Oyetola’s Special Adviser on Civic Engagement, Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, has urged the electorate to vote for his boss during July 16 governorship election in the state. He warned the voters not to be deceived by those he described as “kindergarten politicians”. Oyintiloye said this while representing Oyetola during an engagement programme with the All Farmers Association of Nigeria in Odo-Otin Local Government Area of the state on Sunday. According to him, the business of governance is not meant for the novice, but rather for the intelligent. He also urged the electorate not to be deceived by “untested politicians, whose aim is to destroy the gains the state had achieved in the last few years”. He said, “Election is fast approaching and I want to appeal to the electorate not to allow inexperience politicians to deceive them with fake promises. “We have been together going to four years now, and you can testify to the fact that I have not failed in any of my promises to you. “You know me and I know you. Let’s join hands together to win the forthcoming gubernatorial election for me and like before, you will not be disappointed.” He said Oyetola’s administration distributed more than
100,000 cocoa seedlings to about 1,000 farmers in the state last year. He said agro-chemicals, hand-spraying tools, limes and other farm inputs were also given to the farmers during the period. He also said, last year, the government also set aside 1,000 hectares of land for farming to boost food sufficiency and make the state the food basket of the South-West zone. In his remarks, the AFAN Chairman in the local government, Mr Popoola Akolawole, commended the governor for his support for farmers in the state. Akolawole, however, urged the government to continue supporting the farmers with the necessary farm inputs.
