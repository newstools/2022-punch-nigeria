Non starters against Ghana in the Qatar 2022 World Cup first leg playoff at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi were taken through their paces Saturday evening at the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja during the players’ recovery training. Nigeria held Ghana to a goalless draw in Kumasi in front of a packed 40,000 capacity stadium. Emmanuel Dennis, Oghenekaro Etebo, Sadiq Umar, Shehu Abdullahi, Semi Ajayi, Calvin Bassey, Akinkunmi Amoo, Kenneth Omerou, Ademola Lookman, Odion Ighalo, Ahmed Musa and Frank Onyeka played against each other while starters watched. Goalkeepers Daniel Akpeyi and John Noble also trained separately while the country’s hero in Kumasi Francis Uzoho also watched proceedings from the sidelines. The Eagles are billed to face the Black Stars in the second leg of the playoffs in Abuja on Tuesday. The exercise was handled by assistant coach Emmanuel Amunuke and Paul Aigbogun as well as Joseph Yobo. The training session was opened to the public who were heard loudly cheering the players.
