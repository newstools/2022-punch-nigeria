A Magistrates’ Court in Ota, Ogun State, on Wednesday, ordered a 40-year-old housewife, Biola Joshua, to sweep her son’s school, Iju-Ebiye High School, for six months for invading its premises with thugs. The police had arrested Joshua after she invaded the school with others at large and beat the principal and one other person for scolding her son. The police later dragged her before the magistrate’s court and charged her with conspiracy, assault and breach of peace. Delivering his ruling, Magistrate Shotunde Shotayo, ordered the convict to sweep the school from 8am to 11am every day. He also directed that the school open a log book for the convict, where her daily activities would be recorded for the six-month period. Shotayo, however, gave Joshua a fine option of N30,000 to be given to the injured principal and school official. He held that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. Earlier, the prosecution counsel, Inspector Cynthia Ejezie, told the court that the convict, her son and others at large, committed the offences on March 11, 2021, around 2pm at Iju-Ebiye High School, Ota. Ejezie said the convict and her accomplices assaulted the school principal and the health officer of the school, causing them bodily injuries. She added that they also conducted themselves in a manner likely to cause breach of peace by invading and disrupting academic activities with thugs. The prosecutor said the offences contravened sections 249(d), 355 and 516 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ogun State 2006.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
