Ahead of the March 26 convention of the All Progressives Congress, Gombe State has inaugurated 35 state and local government executives, except the chapter chairman. Recall that earlier, the state APC chairman, Nitte Amanga, was among the state chairmen sworn in by the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee in Abuja. Inaugurating the officials, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Legal Matters, Caleb Ubale, urged them to give their best in serving the interest of the party, stressing that loyalty to the APC should be total. On his part, Governor Muhammadu Yahaya, who was represented by his deputy, Dr Manassah Jatau, commended the new executive members for availing themselves of the service of the party in the interest of the state. Yahaya urged them to give their best in ensuring the electoral success of the party in the state and the country at large. He said, “I commend you for being elected as the APC State executives and also on the administration of the oath of allegiance and oath of office on the 21st March 2022. Much as I really commend you, I’m unable to congratulate you because I know the herculean and daunting task that lies ahead of you as leaders of our great party. “In the first instance, as leaders, you must know that your prestige and dignity are tied to the survival of the party, APC. Implied is that you must all do everything within your position to ensure that the party wins again and again.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
