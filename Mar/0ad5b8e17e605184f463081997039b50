A moment of silence was held at Sunday’s Oscars gala to show support for the people of Ukraine currently facing invasion, conflict, and prejudice within their own borders. The slides projected at the glamorous night celebrating the movie industry showed captions that identified with Ukraine. “While film is an important avenue for us to express our humanity in times of conflict, the reality is, millions of families in Ukraine need food, medical care, clean water, and emergency services. “Resources are scarce and we, collectively as a global community, can do more,” the slides read. The messages were shown at the 94th Academy Awards night that was ongoing at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. The conflict entered its 33rd day on Sunday after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.
