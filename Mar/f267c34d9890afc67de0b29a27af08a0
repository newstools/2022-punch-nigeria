A Federal High Court in Abuja, on Wednesday, fixed April 11 for judgment in a suit seeking the declaration of the seat of the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, vacant on the account of his defection to the All Progressives Congress. Justice Donatus Okorowo, who fixed the date, said the judgment earlier scheduled for Wednesday was not yet ready. The Peoples Democratic Party had asked the court to remove Dogara as the member representing the Bogoro/Dass/Tafawa Balewa Federal Constituency of Bauchi State over his defection to the APC. While the PDP and its state Chairman, Hamza Akuyam, are the plaintiffs, Dogara, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Attorney-General of the Federation, Independent National Electoral Commission and the APC are the defendants in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/1060/2020. Dogara had on July 24, 2020 defected from the PDP to the APC when he submitted a resignation letter to the Chairman of the Bogoro ‘C’ Ward in the state. The plaintiffs, through their counsel, Jubrin Jubrin, said by virtue of Section 68(1)(g) of the Constitution, by defecting from the party that sponsored him to the 9th National Assembly before the expiration of his tenure, Dogara ought to vacate the seat as he was no longer qualified to partake in the activities of the lower house.
