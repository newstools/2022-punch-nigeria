The Federal Capital Territory’s Commissioner of Police, Babaji Sunday, has ordered the arrest of scavengers also known as “Baban Bola” in the territory. He noted that intelligence at the disposal of the command revealed that  their activities now span beyond mere scavenging to other criminal ventures like stealing, carjacking, housebreaking, arms smuggling and drug peddling among others. In a statement on Tuesday by the command’s spokesperson, Josephine Adeh, the command also said the order followed public outcry on the fast-rising menace of vandalism and theft of individual, private and public property, including critical national infrastructure by miscreants who hide under the guise of metal waste scavengers. The statement read, “The CP directed Divisional Police Officers  and heads of tactical formations in the command to work with stakeholders within their various areas of  responsibility  to checkmate the activities of the prevailing criminal enterprise, arrest on sight to bring these rogue scavengers to book. “The CP equally called for extra vigilance on the part of residents, especially areas with intense activities of scavengers, to cooperate with the police in riding the FCT of these criminal elements. “He however enjoined residents not to resort to jungle justice but to arrest and report any rogue scavenger to the nearest police station.” No date has been fixed for the hearing of the case.
