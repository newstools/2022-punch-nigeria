THE Alumni Association of the Federal University of Technology Akure, has urged the Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the Governing Council, Dr Godknows Igali, to select an old student of the institution as its next Vice-Chancellor. A statement made available to The PUNCH on Wednesday, said the President of the FUTA Alumni Worldwide, Mr Adeyemi Bello, told Igali that there are many alumni who are in senior academic positions that fit the position as the institution’s VC. Bello, who was accompanied by former alumni Presidents, Mr Adesomoju Olaitan and Mr Victor Ifezue, and some members of the Abuja branch of the association, said the time had come for an alumnus of the institution to be given the opportunity to serve as VC. He said, “In the last 40 years, the university has consistently produced graduates who are now captains of industries, top civil servants, foremost scientists in Africa and the world at large. “It is worthy of note that alumni of FUTA have served creditably as heads of other institutions in the country and as such should be given the chance to also steer the ship of FUTA as VC. “Our alma mater has trained and produced seasoned administrators for higher institutions such as Vice-Chancellor of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko and Ondo State University of Science and Technology Okitipupa, Rector Federal Polytechnic Ile Oluji among others. “These people have served with core values of our alma mater that include integrity, creativity and innovativeness, accountability, rationality and excellence and there were no reports of maladministration, financial misappropriation, scandal of any nature and corruption allegations against them where they had served.”  Copyright PUNCH.
