Super Falcons captain Asisat Oshoala is delighted to extend her contract with Barcelona until June 30, 2024. Oshoala is currently the leading goalscorer in the Primera Iberdrola league with 16 goals in 19 games. The forward’s contract with the club lapses at the end of the season but on Thursday, the 27-year-old penned a new two-year deal in the presence of club president Joan Laporta and director Xavier Puig at Camp Nou. “I am very happy to continue with the world’s best team, not just for the football, but because off the pitch, they are also best at looking after players and helping them to continue improving,” Oshoala said. “I am a forward and I want to carry on scoring goals. The aim is to continue developing and to be happy.” Oshoala joined Barça on January 31, 2019, and has proved her enormous appetite for goals scoring. She has scored 80 goals in 101 competitive games, already making her the sixth-highest scorer in the team’s history. She is the record-holder for the CAF Women’s Player of The Year award and was recently feted as the Best African Female Footballer of The Decade. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
