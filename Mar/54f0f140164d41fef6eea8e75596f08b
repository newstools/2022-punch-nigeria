The Management of the University of Calabar has directed all students to vacate their halls of residence with immediate effect. This is in line with the fresh directive issued in Calabar on Tuesday by the institution’s Registrar, Mr Gabriel Egbe, following the industrial action embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities. According to the statement, the strike has adversely affected the provision of basic services in the halls of residence and on the campus, generally making it difficult to meet up with the management of these essential services. “Consequently, the acting Chief Security Officer of the institution has been advised to lock up all the hostels as well as deploy security men to man all the halls of residence. “Management wishes all students journey mercies, as they travel to meet their parents/guardians,” it said. The management, however, enjoined students to take advantage of the strike period to engage in activities that would add value to their lives. (NAN)
