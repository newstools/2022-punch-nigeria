THE Bayelsa State House of Assembly on Wednesday approved another request by the administration of Governor Douye Diri to shop for a  N30bn loan. Diri, in his letter to the Assembly, explained that the facility was being sought in anticipation of monies due to Bayelsa State from remittances on deductions to oil-producing states by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Limited. The N30bn loan would be reconciled and negotiated before the compilation and payment of the deductions by the NNPC, resulting from the 13 per cent Derivation meant for the oil-producing states from January 1999 to December 2021. The governor lamented that it was challenging for the government to fund these cost-effective projects because of the state’s lean resources. In their various contributions, the lawmakers unanimously granted their legislative approval of the N30bn loan. The Speaker of the Assembly, Abraham Ingobere, who presided over the proceedings, said, “Borrowing is part of the government. There is a section of the constitution that gives room for borrowing.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
