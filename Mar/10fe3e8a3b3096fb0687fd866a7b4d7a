THE Oba of Lagos, Rilwan Akiolu, on Thursday raised the alarm over what he called the incessant dumping of fake drugs in the Nigerian market. He said the situation posed danger to the health of innocent people. Akiolu was quoted to have spoken when the management and board members of OGC Foods and Beverages, makers of LASENA Water, paid him a courtesy visit in his palace at Isale Eko. He also called on the leadership of the National Agency for Foods and Drugs Administration and Control to checkmate the distribution and consumption of fake drugs in the country. He said, “NAFDAC has a lot to do in checking the menace of fake drugs. I know they are doing their best at the moment, but they can do more in making sure that our markets are free of fake drugs. “Adulterated and fake drugs posed a lot of danger to our health. We must all rise up against it. But NAFDAC must take the lead. “Yes, I know it requires political will to stop because powerful people are involved, but the government must act decisively”, Oba Akiolu said.
