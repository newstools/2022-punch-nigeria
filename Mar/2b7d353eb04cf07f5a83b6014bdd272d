A former Vice Chancellor of the University of Lagos, Prof. Ramon Bello, says there is a need to create 100 new businesses annually over the next 10 years for the nation to have hope of better economy. Bello made this known at the 2022 Faculty of Technology Conference held at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State. Bello, who noted that the country is currently producing experts that could make its economy more productive, said attention should be geared towards creating more entrepreneurs. He said, “The Nigerian economy has translated into a knowledge economy. What that means is that we are turning out a lot of experts that are meant to be able to make things productive and from there, we can move on to entrepreneurship and that’s the direction that every economy is going to. “Now we are getting money being made available for new businesses, we have the Bank of Industry being out for that. We should have other funds available to be able to support younger entrepreneurs to ensure that they set up businesses. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
