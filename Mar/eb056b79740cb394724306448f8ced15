The timely intervention of the police on Tuesday prevented a crisis which occurred at the Iyana Church area of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital from degenerating into a bloody ethnic clash. Our correspondent gathered that a 100-year-old landlord was allegedly stabbed to death by a man suspected to be an Hausa man following an altercation over the cleaning of the compound. The alleged killer reportedly fled the Iyana Church area of Ibadan where the incident happened to avoid being lynched by angry youths in the area. There was another unverified claim that a Hausa man beat an old Yoruba man to death and this led to the fight by some youths from the two sides but the crisis was not allowed to fester. But some residents blamed the clash on rumour, saying the man slumped and died without anybody attacking him but they expressed surprise at the clash which ensued following the centenarian’s death. One of the residents of the area who identified herself as Tosin Adedeji, told our correspondent that peace had since been restored to the area. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Adewale Osifeso, said the timely intervention of the police brought the situation under control. breakdown of law and order.” Copyright PUNCH.
