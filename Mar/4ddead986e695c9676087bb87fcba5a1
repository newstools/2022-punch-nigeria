The Commissioner, National Population Commission, representing Cross River State, Navy Captain Charles Ogwa (retd.), says the proposed population and housing census will produce data that will not be disputed. This, he said, was because the data collection that started with the enumeration area demarcation had been digitalised by the commission. Ogwa gave the assurance on Friday in Calabar while addressing journalists on the ongoing enumeration area demarcation involving five local government areas in the state, namely Bekwarra, Obudu, Ogoja, Ikom, and Etung. “Unlike in the past when data collection was manually done, the present exercise is digital. Once information is received from a particular person or household, it is stringed to local government, the state, zonal and headquarters of the commission’s database,” he said. He advised Nigerians to disabuse their minds of fear that the proposed population and housing census would clash with the 2023 general elections. According to him, the census would last for only 10 days if November 2022 is approved by the President, while the general elections begin in February 2023.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
