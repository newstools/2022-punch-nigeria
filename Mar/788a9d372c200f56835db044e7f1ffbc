THE Ekiti State Governor, Mr Kayode Fayemi, has inaugurated a tech and entrepreneurship skills centre in Ikun-Ekiti. According to a statement on Sunday, the infrastructure named JM Tech Centre, is a non-profit technology hub developed to equip youths of Ekiti, Nigerians and Africans with requisite 21st-century tech and entrepreneurship skills to become nation-builders. The founder of the Tech Hub, Mr. Mike Olajide, expressed his appreciation to the state governor for supporting the development of the facility. He said, “I have always dreamt about a day like this when development will come to this area, when young people from our communities will have access to resources and opportunities to make a global impact and when financial freedom will not be limited to a few people. “This dream was inspired when by providence I built a career in technology and by the grace of God, made a success of it by developing solutions that have made a tremendous national and global impact. “Now that I am of age, I want to see other young people from our various communities in Ekiti State rise and become a valuable part of the global push for digital transformation. “I want the youths of Ekiti State to build capacity in technology. I want to see them acquire globally relevant technology skills and become highly sought-after professionals in Nigeria and across the world. I want to see our youths break out of poverty and be financially liberated. I want Ekiti state to be revered as one of the communities producing the new generation of changemakers in technology. This is the reason I invested in building the JM Tech Centre in Ikun-Ekiti.” Fayemi, in his speech,  also reaffirmed the state’s support and commitment towards ensuring the youths of Ekiti gain massively from the establishment of the facility.
