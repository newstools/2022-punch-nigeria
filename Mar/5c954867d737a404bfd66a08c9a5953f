Troops of Operation Hadin Kai have overrun a stronghold of the Islamic State of West Africa Province in Sambisa forest. The terrorists were said to have fled their camp following the operation carried out by the troops condemned Desert Sanity. In a statement on Friday by the Director, Defence Media Operations, Major General Benard Onyeuko, said the troops, however, recovered various equipment during the operation. The statement was titled ‘Troops of operation Hadin Kai overrun terrorists’ stronghold in Sambisa forest’. It read in part, “On March 24, 2022, the troops of OPERATION HADIN KAI in a Special Operation codenamed OP DESERT SANITY captured the terrorist stronghold of UKUBA/CAMP ZAIRO in Sambisa Forest. “In what could be described as a blitzkrieg, the troops routed the terrorists and captured their enclave. The terrorists fled the camp leaving behind their heavy weapon arsenal. “After a thorough cordon and search of the captured camp, the gallant troops recovered various equipment including 1x Main Battle Tank, 1x 155mm Bofors gun, 1xTrailer, 1x122mm gun, 2x105mm gun, 1x Mines Resistance Ambush Protected (MRAP) fighting vehicle, 1x MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carrier, 1x Mack Trailer as well as a large cache of arms and ammunition left behind by the terrorists. “Further exploitation is ongoing. The capture of the terrorist stronghold of CAMP ZAIRO is a major setback to the terrorist criminals.” Onyeuko, however, enjoined them not to rest on their oars but use this as a springboard to finally defeat the insurgents and also keep up the fighting spirit.
