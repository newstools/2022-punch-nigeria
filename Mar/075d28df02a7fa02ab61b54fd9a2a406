The PUNCH had reported that PDP had slated its governorship primaries for Tuesday. Wale Ojo’s faction of the party was supported by Mr Soji Adagunodo, the party Deputy National Chairman in the South-West to be the party’s state chairman, while Sunday Bisi was supported by Senator Ademola Adeleke-led faction. The two camps were laying claims to the chairmanship position of the party in the state. While supporters, as well as delegates of the Ojo-led faction, were at the Women and Children Development Initiative Foundation, Osogbo Centre for the primary, the Bisi faction was currently holding its primary at the Osogbo City Stadium. Also, the party’s 2018 governorship candidate, Ademola Adeleke,  is coming up against Prince Dotun Babayemi for the same ticket. However, there was a heavy security presence at the WOCDIF Centre and Osogbo City Stadium, the venues of the parallel primaries. Dr Akin Ogunbiyi, Dele Adeleke and Fatai Akinbade had earlier announced their withdrawal from the race on Monday night. As at the time of filing this report, both factions are still putting final touches on the arrangement for the primaries. Also, the Gov. Douye Diri of Bayelsa, Chairman of the Osun Governorship primary, has yet to show up in any of the two venues of the congress. (NAN)
