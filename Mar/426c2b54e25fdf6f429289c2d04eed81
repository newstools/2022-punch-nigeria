Afro- pop singer, Dapo Aiyegbusi, aka Daayuur, has stated that though his music makes him attractive to the opposite sex, he does not take advantage of them. In an interview with Sunday Scoop, the United Kingdom-based Ekiti-born artiste, said, “I will not shy away from the fact that ladies love to be around me. I guess my height and biceps attract them because I work out regularly. However, the major things ladies fall for are my songs. I have songs that were basically done out of my admiration for them (women) and they show me love too.  When I perform, they turn out in their numbers and I get into their hearts when I ‘do my thing’. However, I never take advantage of them because I respect them a lot.” Daayuur, who is set to release a new song titled, You Bad, also said he is working on an Extended Play album. He said, “Me and my management team are working very hard to release my EP, so that people can have a better feel of what I am capable of musically. It is something worth looking forward to, because we will do everything to make it of high quality.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
