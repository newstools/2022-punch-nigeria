The Federal Government has approved and commenced the implementation of the 25 per cent freight rate increase to members of the Nigerian Association of Road Transport Owners in a bid to clear the fuel queues in many parts of the country. Following the implementation of the new rate, NARTO on Saturday urged its members to resume full operations so as to halt the fuel scarcity experienced in Abuja and many other states. Some members of NARTO had suspended their services because of high cost of operation and the low freight rate that was paid to transport owners by the government in the past. Consequently, they demanded increased freight rate from the Federal Government, which according to the NARTO National President, Yusuf Othman, was currently being implemented by government. Othman in a statement issued in Abuja, also stated that the association was working hard on how to get palliatives on diesel from the Federal Government, considering the rise in the cost of the commodity lately. He said, “I am calling on our members (transporters) to get back to full operation now that the 25 per cent freight rate has been implemented. “I can confirm that the 25 per cent rate has been approved and implemented. So I am calling on members to get back to operations with a view to reducing the sufferings of the general public. “In addition, we are trying to look into how to get diesel palliatives from government.” Copyright PUNCH.
