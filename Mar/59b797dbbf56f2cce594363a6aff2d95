Ninety-seven Ukrainian children have died since the start of Russia’s invasion as fighting rages on, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday in a speech to Canada’s parliament. “They’ve already killed 97 Ukrainian children,” Zelensky said in the video address, adding that Russia’s military was “destroying everything: memorial complexes, schools, hospitals, housing complexes.” “We’re not asking for much. We’re asking for justice, for real support, which will help us to prevail, to defend (ourselves), to save lives,” he said, receiving a standing ovation from lawmakers. AFP
