A governorship aspirant in Akwa Ibom State, Mr Aniekan Etim, has blamed the lack of development and progress in the State on poor leadership. According to him, questionable and misplaced leadership had made it difficult for the state to realise her capacities despite the human and material potential that abound in it. Speaking while interacting with journalists on Saturday, the aspirant said that the time for right fulfillment had come, adding that he was joining the race to lead “beyond the intractable, unfulfilled state of affairs in the State.” According to him, Akwa Ibom is our State. It’s a geo-political entity South-East corner of Nigeria. Without a doubt, it has scored many firsts in Nigeria and globally, and is naturally blessed with human and natural resources whose potential is unquantifiable, but beg for proper harnessing. “Nigeria, Africa, and indeed, the world, need Akwa Ibom and depend on us to be stable, grow and sustain the development. The sad story is that presently, despite our potential, we are yet to realize our enviable capacities owing to questionable and misplaced leadership.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
