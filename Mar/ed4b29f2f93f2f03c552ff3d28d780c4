A group, Youths and Environmental Advocacy Centre, has raised the alarm over an oil spill which reportedly occurred at Touma-Ama Community Manifold in Bille Kingdom, Degema Local Government Area of Rivers State. The group said the spill spread into the environment, destroying the ecosystem in the area. While noting that the spill occurred on March 5, the group called on the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency to investigate the incident. The group’s Executive Director, Fyneface Dumnamene, disclosed this in a statement issued in Port Harcourt on Sunday. He said a member of the centre’s One Million Youth Volunteers Network of Human Right Defenders and Promoters in the Niger Delta, Isaac Opiriyabo-Ofori, confirmed the spill.  Copyright PUNCH.
