The Director-General, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, Dr Bashir Jamoh; and a political economist, Prof. Pat Utomi, on Tuesday urged workers to make peak performance their career goal. The duo made the call at the public presentation of a book, ‘The challenge to perform,’ which was written by Mr Ubong Essien. Essien is the publisher of the Achievers journal and Achiever’s manual. Jamoh said it required dedication and hard work to write a book, saying the book was an instrument to challenge anyone to peak performance in their profession. He said, “It is a good book to address both public and private sector. It does not have any bias. Performance is key in anything you do in life; if you don’t have a performance indicator, you won’t know where you are heading. “You need to confirm what you set out to achieve and check why you couldn’t achieve it.” Similarly, Utomi encouraged professionals not to always seek positions but to perform and touch lives. “Peak performance is about what you do, how you touch the lives of people, performance keeps you in the consciousness of people. “It is not about position, it is about touching lives long after you have gone. People are still talking about you. It is about something you did or say that touched them and It is either you perish or perform,” he said. The book reviewer, Mr Ismail Aniemu, said the book would assist anyone to be productively relevant in the scheme of things. Essien thanked his mentor, former DG, NIMASA, Dr Ade Dosumu, for his impact on his life. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
