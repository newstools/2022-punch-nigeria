The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi, has ordered the arrest of people involved in the distribution of petrol as a souvenir at a party in the state. The state Police Public Relations Officer, CSP Adekunle Ajisebutu, confirmed the development in a statement on Saturday. The statement read, “The attention of the Lagos State Police Command has been drawn to a video going viral on social media in which some individuals and organisers of an event were seen giving out some kegs containing PMS (petrol) as souvenirs. “It’s regrettable that in spite of series of warnings and sensitisations carried out by the police and other relevant government agencies, some individuals could be handling such combustible substance in a public place in total disregard for the safety of lives and properties. “Still concerned about the safety, and protection of lives and properties of citizens, the Lagos State Police Command once again appeals to citizens to avoid this kind of condemnable act in the name of generosity. “Although the event centre where the distribution of the souvenirs took place has been located and subsequently sealed, the Commissioner of Police, CP Abiodun Alabi, has, in addition, ordered the arrest of all persons involved in this regrettable and reprehensible act.” Copyright PUNCH.
