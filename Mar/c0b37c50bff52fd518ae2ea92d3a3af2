An Edo State High School, Lumen Christi has been awarded the Augustus Bamidele award for producing the best aggregate results in the West Africa Senior Secondary Certificate Examination for the sixth time. According to details provided by WAEC, the school had won the Augustus Bamidele Oyediran Award in 2007, 2009, 2011, 2014, 2016 and 2021. Receiving the award in Abuja on Tuesday, at the 70th Annual Council Meeting of the West African Examinations Council, the principal of the school, Rev. Fr. Theophilus Itaman, said the sustainability of the award was through hard work. He said sustainability is something that worked in any organisation, “so with that, we made a conscious effort to ensure that starting from the admission process we are thorough and ensuring that there is a foundation to build on our admission.” Itaman noted that many people were not paying attention to supervision, thinking that paying salary alone was what was required. “We also ensure that the teachers are well-motivated to give their best. We also work on our teachers knowing full well that the products of our today’s universities cannot really do what we are looking for,” he said. While noting that they put in place ongoing formation for their teachers and ensure that their educators were properly trained from time to time through seminars to bring them up to date.
