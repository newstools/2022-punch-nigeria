The Nigeria Customs Service, Federal Operations Unit, Zone A, Lagos State, has seized smuggled items including rice, petrol, frozen poultry products, among others in February 2022. The Acting Controller, Federal Operations Unit, Zone A, Hussein Ejibunu, who confirmed the development, said the duty paid value of the seized items was N587,901,165. He said, “Today’s press briefing is the second for the year 2022. As usual, it is intended to x-ray the unit’s activities for February 2022. In spite of the lull in business activities, the deployment of the unit’s strategies, and officers’ determination to suffocate smugglers, a lot had been done within the period under review. “The unit is showcasing the under-listed seizures which were intercepted between February 3 and 28, 2022. They include 6,749 bags of smuggled parboiled rice at 50kg each equivalent to 11 trailers load; 36,575 litres of premium motor spirit; 599 bales of secondhand clothing; 906 cartons of frozen poultry products; 2,001 pieces of used tyres; 175 pieces of used compressors; 180 cartons of foreign soap. “52 used fridges; 285 cartons of unregistered pharmaceutical products; 13 units of fairly used vehicles; 15 cartons and 23 bales of lace materials; 338 cartons of mosquito repellant. All with a duty paid value of N587,901,165. Revenue generated through recoveries of low value, transfer of value, wrong classification, and public auction sales of PMS amounted to N79,067,560.75.” Ejibunu said the Southwest zone had become hot for smugglers to operate freely in recent times, adding that the fight against smuggling activities should be a collaborative effort. He added, “As I always say, no one claps with one hand. The fight against smuggling and smugglers needs the cooperation and collaboration of everyone. We need credible information to successfully combat smuggling considering the overwhelmingly negative consequences. “Smuggling is a complete monster with a direct link to illicit drugs and drug abuse, armed robberies, kidnapping, the balance of trade deficit, unemployment, increased crime waves, high mortality rate as a result of fake drugs and youth restiveness. It is, therefore, our collective responsibility to say no to smuggling.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
