Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger State has just arrived at the National Secretariat of the All Progressives Congress. Although it is unconfirmed whether he takes over as Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee or not, our correspondent observed that the Governor’s vehicle was parked at the space reserved only for the Chairman. Bello alongside other party chieftains are currently in a closed-door meeting. Earlier on Monday, there have been reports of the governor replacing Mai Mala Buni as ‘sole administrator’ of the APC. But the National Secretary of the CECPC, Dr James Akpanudoedehe, debunked the reports saying, Buni remained the Chairman and would oversee the party’s affairs until the election of new members of the National Working Committee come March 26 Convention.
