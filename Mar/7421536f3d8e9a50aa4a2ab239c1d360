The Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, has urged Nigerians to register with the Independent National Electoral Commission so they can vote in the 2023 elections. The governor spoke on Thursday at the 10th-anniversary celebration of Radio Nigeria – Prime 101.5FM, Lokoja. “Those who are saying power belongs to the politicians are wrong; if that is the case, there won’t have been any need for them to come to you every four years to ask for mandates or renewal. So the ultimate owners of power are the people on behalf of which politicians exercise such power,” he quipped. Bello said the only way people can exercise their constitutional rights and power is to get their name in the voters’ register to enable them to discharge their civic responsibility. The governor called on the youths in the country to be prepared to take over the mantle of leadership come 2023 “because it’s their time.” The Director-General of Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria, Dr Mansur Liman, in his address, said that the corporation would ensure free and fair general elections in 2023. According to him, even though the nation is no doubt passing through challenging times, “we should therefore play our role as the fourth estate of the realm, as impartial arbiters to ensure that the forthcoming general election is conducted in a free and transparent atmosphere. We in Radio Nigeria are committed to this”. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
