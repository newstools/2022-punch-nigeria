A Chicago, United States of America-based singer, Tolulope Apata, aka LuGotti, has said that his sound is eclectic and cannot be put in a box. In an interview with Saturday Beats, he said, “My sound is very unique and it does not fit into any box. I like to call it a hybrid of afrobeats and RnB. I can also do rap music.” On his biggest inspiration, he said, “The love I get from the people who are touched by my music is probably my biggest inspiration to keep going.” The singer also stated that he considered his first single, ‘10 for 10’ to be a high point of his career. He said, “The acceptance of the song made me know that I had to hit the ground running. I followed it up with another single titled, ‘Beamer Benz’. For my latest song, I featured Davido Music Worldwide signee, Peruzzi, and I consider it to be my biggest song so far. The video is out already. “It was actually the producer of the song, Dante, that suggested I should feature Peruzzi when he heard the direction the track was going. I agreed and Peruzzi delivered 100 per cent.” Speaking on the challenges he currently faces and the changes he would like to see in the industry, he said, “Trying to move to the next level has been a little difficult but I am enjoying the journey and the constant progress. “However, I would like to see more people being original and not just copying the sound that is in vogue at the moment.” Copyright PUNCH.
