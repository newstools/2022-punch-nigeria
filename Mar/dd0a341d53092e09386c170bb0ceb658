Fox News Media CEO, Suzanne Scott, announced Tuesday that veteran Fox News cameraman, Pierre Zakrzewski, has died after his vehicle was struck by incoming fire in Horenka, outside Kyiv, on Monday. Fox News journalist, Benjamin Hall, who was also with Zakrzewski when his vehicle came under fire, was injured and has since been hospitalised, Scott said. “It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that we share the news this morning regarding our beloved cameraman, Pierre Zakrzewski,” Scott announced. “Pierre was a war zone photographer who covered nearly every international story for FOX News from Iraq to Afghanistan to Syria during his long tenure with us,” she added. “His passion and talent as a journalist were unmatched.” Speaking of the 55-year-old Zakrzewski, Fox News president and executive editor, Jay Wallace, said Tuesday, “Pierre was a constant in all of our international coverage. I, like countless others, always felt an extra sense of reassurance when arriving on the scene and seeing him with camera in hand.” “The legacy of his positive spirit, boundless energy and eye for the story will carry on,” he added. Zakrzewski is the second journalist to be killed within two days in the ongoing war in Ukraine. A former reporter of New York Times, Brent Renaud, was killed on Sunday when Russian forces opened fire on his vehicle. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
