CYBERSAFE Foundation has graduated its first cohort of digital skilled young women under its DigiGirls Initiative. According to the firm, its first batch of 2400 women has completed its three-month digital skills acquisition training. It added that its project was in collaboration with the United Kingdom government through its Digital Access Programme, and was initiated to skill and upskill women between the ages of 15-40 years old with in-demand basic to intermediary employable digital skills. The Founder/Chief Executive Officer of Cybersafe Foundation, Confidence Staveley, said the beneficiaries were chosen from all the states in the nation. She explained that the programme employed a peer learning group system, state hangouts where participants in each state clustered to interact, build connections and relationships within their communities. She added, “This event was held to create bonds, a sense of community, and expand the network of our beneficiaries.” Speaking during the event, the British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing, said, “We are also delighted that, as announced last month by the UK’s Minister for Africa, during her visit to Nigeria, we are able to expand this project to directly benefit an additional 4000 women, and reach a further 10,000 women through the train the trainer approach.”  Copyright PUNCH.
