FOUR persons were said to have been burnt to death in an auto crash that occurred between Ohono and Akpanya along Lokoja-Abuja Road in Lokoja Local Government Area of Kogi State on Thursday. It was gathered that the accident happened at about 7am when an 18-seater bus lost control while returning from Lagos to Kano State. Three of the victims, according to residents of the communities, are uniformed men while other passengers in the vehicles were rescued with various degrees of injuries. As of the time of filing this report, the 18-seater bus was still burning while officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps were seen at the scene of the accident. The Kogi State Sector Commander, FRSC, Solomon Agure, confirmed the incident to journalists on Thursday. “It was a night journey. In the early morning of today, between 6.30am and 7am, there was a tanker that was parked by the road side and the vehicle lost control and hit the tanker and later burst into flame,” he said. Agure advised motorists to avoid night journey saying, “God who created us knows why he created day and night. The vehicle is coming from Lagos in the night. “For him to be around Jamata Bridge, Akpayan Road at that early hours means he drove throughout the night. Drivers should avoid stressing themselves by driving at night to avoid accidents on our roads.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
