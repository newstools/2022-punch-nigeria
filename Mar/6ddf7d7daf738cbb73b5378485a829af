A group known as Amaechi Vanguard in USA/Canada has urged the All Progressives Congress to choose the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, as the party’s consensus presidential candidate. The Coordinator of the group, Daniels Chukwuma, said Amaechi had made enough sacrifices for the APC to be considered qualified to emerge a consensus presidential candidate for the party for the 2023 presidential election. According to the group, Amaechi’s courage in canvassing for Muhammadu Buhari’s presidential ambition in 2015 in South-South and South-East zones was one of the major reasons the APC became the ruling party in the country. Chukwuma said, “Chief Chibuike Amaechi had made enough sacrifices for the APC. He has taken enough bullets for the APC. Amaechi was at the forefront of canvassing for Muhammadu Buhari’s presidential ambition in the South-South and South-East zones in 2015 at a time it was like a sin to do so in the two regions. “He canvassed for Buhari in Rivers, Bayelsa, Edo, Akwa Ibom and others states in the South-East. Remember these are Goodluck Jonathan’s home states and areas he was hugely supported. “But Amaechi took the bull by the horns and went through the humiliation process to ensure that the APC won the 2015 presidential election. “Also, remember that he was the one who in 2014 led five aggrieved PDP governors to the APC. That move fortified APC and positioned it for the victory in 2015.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
