THE Office of the Auditor-General for the Federation has issued 50 audit queries against the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund over alleged misappropriation and unaccountability for various expenses amounting to about N87bn. In its report presented being treated by the House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts, the office alleged undue ministerial interference in the affairs of the NSITF, in violation of a Federal Government circular with number ECD/P/230 issued on October 18, 1996, which bars supervising ministries from interfering in the finances of departments and agencies under them. In the report, the OAuGF directed the NSITF management to explain and provide evidence on how N41.683bn was spent without the necessary approvals or face sanctions. The office also asked the management to justify, recover and remit to the Federation Account, the sum of N10.9bn spent by the NSITF without evidence of expenditure; to account for how N29.2bn was utilized, and to explain another extra-budgetary spending of N5.528bn. An audit query in the report said the NSITF was implementing a peculiar salary structure and paying irregular allowances to its staff members, without the approval of the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission, leading to illegal payment of N38.219bn as salaries and N1.872bn as allowances. Among the irregular allowances is the payment of about N69m as ‘management allowances’ for housing, furniture, and generators to the Managing Director and the three Executive Directors in 2017, different from the regular monthly allowance they received. The OAuGF also alleged that the NSIFT transferred over N17bn to some unnamed persons and companies between 2013 and 2018 without providing payment vouchers and other documents to authenticate the payments. Also, the report accused the NSITF management of diverting N5.5bn from a Skye Bank account to a new account with Zenith Bank in 2014, adding that the second account was opened without the approval of the Accountant General of the Federation as required by Financial Regulation 713. The office further alleged that the NSITF transferred the sum of N504.22m from its Investment E-Collection Account to Capital Fund Expenditure Account without the approval of the board, while the sum of N100.215m was returned, leaving a balance of N404m in the Capex Account. A query said the NSITF engaged in unauthorised investments worth about N2.2bn without adequate records to back up such investments, adding that this may have led to the diversion of government funds to private use. According to the report, the firm failed to account for about N93m, being the return on investment from its properties, adding that 18.7 per cent of the gross rent collected was abnormal. It stated that the average return on investment of one per cent is considered too low, in view of the fact that they were investment opportunities that could have yielded better returns far above the rate. Another query said NSITF deducted Pay As You Earn, Value Added Tax and Withholding Tax amounting to about N3.623bn between January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017, without remitting the fund to the appropriate tax authority. Other allegations against the NSITF in the report include failure to present payment vouchers from 2012 to 2017, amounting to N6.89bn; irregularities in the award of ICT related contracts worth N5.532bn, some of which were duplicated or without Certificate of No Objections; payment for contracts worth N1.34bn not supported by relevant documents; and contact splitting worth N390.414m. The NSITF was also accused of irregular award of a training contract (N250m) without following due process; contract payment without evidence of performance (N151.39m); award of a contract worth N157.98m to a contractor without documents to back up the contract; and irregular award of a consultancy contract for processing and regularisation of title deeds and survey plans worth N120m. The Auditor-General also queried payment of N170.33m to a consultant without proper documentation, which could lead to misappropriation and misapplication of funds; irregular payment of N96.89m for the suppliers of UPS and inverters; award of contract for the supply of 22 vehicles at the cost of N146.03m without due process; and another contract for the supply of one Prado SUV at the cost of N48.3m without board approval. The NSITF was also said to have paid N35.9m for a contract not executed; and paid N32.3m for a contract without due process as no tender documents were provided. The AUGF also accused the fund of spending N926.534 million to engage external solicitors without clearance from the Office of Attorney General of the Federation, while spending another N185 million as legal fees without the approval of the Attorney General. It also accused the Fund of making irregular payment of public funds to Bureau de change worth N467.42m and paying about N84m to travel agents without any supporting documents, spending N180.84m on international travel without the approval of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and spending another N35.422m on estacode without approval.
