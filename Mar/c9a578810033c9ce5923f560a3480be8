The Deputy National Secretary of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, Chief Godwin Udu, has said a former Secretary to Ebonyi State Government, Prof. Benard Odoh, stands a better chance of clinching the governorship ticket of the party, if he decides to run, than those allegedly being sponsored by the powers that be in the state. He also said that Odoh’s track records and mass followership placed him at a vintage position to win the governorship election in the state in 2023. Udu spoke while briefing journalists in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State capital, on Sunday. He said, “Prof. Benard Odoh stands a better chance of winning the party’s governorship ticket than those allegedly being sponsored by the powers that be in the state in order to destroy APGA. “I am saying so because of his track records and mass followership. We are confident he will win the governorship of the state, should he make up his mind to run. He served this current government, resigned on his own and left without a stain on his image.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
