A former Managing Director and Chief Executive of FSB International Bank, Alhaji Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, has announced his intention to run for president in 2023. Hayatu- Deen, at a briefing in Lagos on Wednesday, said he was on a mission to create the conditions for national rebirth and renewal by re-igniting the boundless energy, imagination and creativity of the Nigerian people. The presidential hopeful noted that Nigeria needs an unusual kind of leader who is fully equipped with the type of skills, character and experience to safely navigate the people out of stormy waters to a much brighter and better place reflective of the nation’s rich potential for greatness. He said, “I believe I am that person who can provide such uncommon leadership with clarity, conviction and dynamism. I’m on a journey to create the conditions for national rebirth and renewal by re-igniting the boundless energy, imagination and creativity of the Nigerian people. “The philosophy I espouse revolves around a free enterprise economy designed to deliver prosperity to the Nigerian people by quickly lifting them out of poverty and positioning Nigeria to become a powerhouse in the emerging markets. “One of the cardinal principles of this philosophy is predicated on fiscal prudence in the management of public funds and in the efficacy of execution of public works programmes with a significant portion of our income dedicated to development projects which will have a significant impact on people’s lives.” Copyright PUNCH.
