Unity Bank Plc says it is partnering with AltSchool Africa to sponsor female students in acquisition of specialist software skills, an empowerment initiative to boost the capacity of the female gender. A statement said this was to commemorate International Women’s Day. The statement said, “AltSchool Africa is a school for individuals looking to gain technical skills and kick start a career in software engineering. “The school currently prides itself on the large enrolment of female students. Unity Bank Plc is providing funds to encourage enrolment of young female students into AltSchool who will pursue a career in Informational Technology.” The bank said the gesture had become imperative to the tag, #BreakTheBias against women in the emerging information technology industry, where a recent study by ONE Campaign and the Center for Global Development, showed that less than 30 per cent of technology companies in Nigeria were owned by women. It said this was as the female members of the entire tech ecosystem workforce constituted less than 20        per cent. Speaking on the partnership, Unity Bank’s Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mrs Tomi Somefun, said the initiative to extend the scholarships to the young women looking to start a career in the IT industry not only aligned with the theme of the IWD 2022, “#BreakTheBias,” but was in tandem with the bank’s corporate social responsibility and sustainability initiative targeting education and empowerment.
