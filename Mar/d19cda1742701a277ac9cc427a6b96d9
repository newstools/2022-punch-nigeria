The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, on Thursday described the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, as the “shield” of the ruling All Progressives Congress. According to a statement on Thursday, Lawan spoke during the inauguration of Senator Yakubu Oseni’s constituency projects across Kogi Central. “The Governor of Kogi State, , Alhaji Yahaya Bello is the Shield of APC in Nigeria, and therefore he is the Sarkin Yaki of APC in Nigeria,” the Senate President was quoted as saying. He also commended Oseni for being invaluable to the 9th Senate despite being a first term lawmaker, noting that he had gathered robust experience, which automatically placed him in vantage position to lead the sensitive Senate Committee on Information and Communication Technology/Cyber security, including membership of other committees. He noted that the 600 capacity JAMB CBT centre facilitated by Oseni would have generational impacts on the teeming youths of Kogi Central who seek admission to schools of higher learning. Bello had earlier highlighted the successes of APC in the state, just as he reaffirmed that his administration would not relent in supporting visionary leaders that could impact positively on the people in line with his party’s vision. The governor, who was represented by his deputy, Edward Onoja, also noted that Oseni’s legacy projects across Kogi Central had been unprecedented. In his response, Oseni commended the governor for supporting his dream to serve the people of Kogi Central as Senator, while emphasising that he would never act in a way that would jeopardise the confidence reposed in him.
