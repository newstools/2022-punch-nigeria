American rapper and business mogul, Kanye West, has stated that he wanted the best for his children. This was as he reaffirmed his disapproval over the usage of TikTok by his eight-year-old daughter, North West. In an Instagram post on Sunday, the Donda star faulted his daughter for singing a love song on the video creation app. The rapper had last month complained that his daughter, whom he shared with his estranged wife, Kim Kardashian, used TikTok “against his will”. In his latest Instagram post, the father-of-four slammed those who said he had no say in his children’s lives. He also disapproved of his children attending a “godless” school, as he also called out a blogger, Perez Hilton, who had always tackled him. He said, “I told y’all before about this TikTok stuff. Now my eight-year-old on here singing she fell in love with an emo girl “Leftist don’t want fathers to have no say in our children’s lives. I don’t want my kids at godless Sierra Canyon school. “I got a voice and I’m not having this And Perez Hilton you still ain’t answer my question. And never put my name next to the word abuse. Don’t play with my name like that.” Ye, as he is now formally called, also lambasted actor D.L Hughley who had recently accused him of stalking Kim and their four children. “I’m a real person who wants the best for my children And DL Hughley is a pawn.” “Yeah I know a king is not supposed to address a pawn but I address everything and would address DL. So don’t speak on me or my children, I can afford to hurt you,” Ye warned. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
