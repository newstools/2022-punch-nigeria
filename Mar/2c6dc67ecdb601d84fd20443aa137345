The Katsina Emirate council has accepted the resignation of Professor Sani Lugga as Wazirin Katsina. The resignation officially became effective from Monday, February 28, 2022, according to a letter signed by the Secretary to the Emirate council, Alhaji Mamma Ifo. The letter explained that the Emir of Katsina, Dr. Abdulmumini Usman, had accepted his ( Professor Lugga) resignation as Wazirin katsina. The spokesman for the Emir’s palace, Iro Bindawa did not pick his calls on Tuesday and he was yet to respond to the SMS sent to him on the development. The PUNCH recalls that Professor Lugga resigned his appointment as Wazirin Katsina last Wednesday shortly after the Emirate council issued him a query on his comments on the state of security in the state (Katsina) at a seminar in Ilorin, Kwara State capital, a fortnight ago. The Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, was in Katsina on Sunday where he held a two-hour closed door meeting with Dr. Usman over what sources said was part of efforts to resolve issues concerning the resignation. The meeting took place at the palace of the Emir of Katsina. Professor Lugga could not be reached for comments on Tuesday as his aides insisted he had travelled out of Katsina. Copyright PUNCH.
