The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has directed the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, to consult and draft a memorandum to the Federal Executive Council as regards linking the Lekki Deep Seaport facility to the nation’s rail network. Buhari stated this when he visited the Deep Seaport in Lagos. Speaking on the purpose of the visit, Amaechi explained that the commencement of operations at Lekki port would strengthen the nation’s maritime sector to meet the ever-growing demands for goods transported by sea and would also position the nation as a maritime hub for the West African sub-region, extending to the Central African Republic. He said, “I can confirm that Buhari is delighted with the progress of work done on the project. I am also happy, and I am sure everyone is happy that the project is going on as scheduled, and we are looking forward to the official commissioning and commencement of operations. Also speaking during the visit, the Chief Executive Officer, Lekki Free Trade Zone Enterprise Limited, Mr Du Ruogang, stated that his company was working round the clock to complete constructions as scheduled in September to ensure that commercial operations commence in the fourth quarter of 2022. He said, “We are indeed very pleased and grateful to His Excellency, the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari for the visit to Lekki Port today. “This day will remain a memorable one in the history of this port, we sincerely thank the President and all the dignitaries that accompanied here today even as we look forward to having them soon for the official commissioning.”  Copyright PUNCH.
