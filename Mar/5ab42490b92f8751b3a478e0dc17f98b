A leading business and management consulting firm, Phillips Consulting, has provided deep insight into the future of work and how the workplace can survive the post-COVID- era. According to the firm, exploring emerging trends and distilling potential impacts on critical industries across Africa can help to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on the workplace. Speaking at the AfricaNXT2022, the company noted that the future of work as the world comes to grips with the next normal would see businesses and teams’ continuous adjustments in order to remain relevant and competitive. Quoting a recent study, the Managing Director of Phillips Consulting, Robert Taiwo, said, “This is the best time for a reset, especially after COVID-19. Employees are looking for a different type of leadership. “Old school methods of command and control are collapsing. It is a new day and a new time. Companies that are going to win are embracing a new way. People are looking for more than money; increasingly, people are working for purpose. Work-place culture is also taking the forefront in the way people seek employment.” Also speaking, the Senior Managing Consultant & Head of Advisory, Mr Joshua Ademuwagun, noted, “We shared best practices and offered industry-focused considerations on how business leaders need to rethink their business models and strategies to best position themselves to leverage emerging opportunities.” Corroborating earlier speakers, Arinola Fetuga, Head, Human Resources and Administration, Lagos State Employment Trust Fund said, “Technology comes into play when building the future of work. But company policies, feedback, structure, and processes have to be adaptable to fit the evolving future.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
