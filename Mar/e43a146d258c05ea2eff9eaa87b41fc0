Bandits have killed 37 people and kidnapped 62 in Bungudu and Bukkuyum Local Government Areas of Zamfara State. The PUNCH gathered that 17 people were killed in two villages of Juyi and Doruwa in Bungudu Local Government, while 20 were killed in Ganar-Kiyawa village of Bukkuyum Local Government. In a press release, the Special Adviser to Governor Bello Mattawale on Media, Zailani Bappa, said the Governor was deeply saddened by the recent attacks on some communities in the state. In the press release, Matawalle said the “dastardly and cowardly” attack was coming at a time when peace was fast improving in the state, adding that it would not deter the efforts of his administration at achieving it. He said, “It is unfortunate that this attack is coming at a time when we are experiencing improved peace in the state where we were able to host millions of people on an important religious event without a single incidence. “However, this and other isolated cases of banditry across the state will not deter our efforts at ensuring a peaceful Zamfara State, an oath we have taken to pursue with our fullest capability.” While condoling the families of those whose lives were lost in “the senseless attack”, Governor Matawalle ordered the Ministry for Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management to immediately release relief materials to all victims of the attack and their families.
