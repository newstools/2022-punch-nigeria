Super Eagles head coach Austin Eguavoen says he left out CSKA Moscow winger Chidera Ejuke from his 25-man squad to face Ghana next weekend in a crucial Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifying play-off due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, The PUNCH reports. Ejuke was named in a seven-man standby list for the game billed for the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi on March 25, with the return leg at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja four days later. “We know the qualities of Ejuke and we count on him,” Eguavoen said. “Yes, he was out of shape at the African Cup of Nations, but we discussed this with him. Now there are no problems. “In the current situation, I decided not to include him in the list of 25 players in the main squad due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “There are political decisions that complicate the life of football players and that includes flights. In the future, of course, Ejuke will be included in our plans.” Ejuke, 24, made two appearances at the recent Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Cameroon. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
