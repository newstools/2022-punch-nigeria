Nigerian singer and songwriter, Inetimi Timaya Odon, known better as Timaya, and music artists manager, Ubi Franklin, on Wednesday, disagreed over January 2021 fight involving the duo. While Timaya claimed he beat up Franklin during the encounter, the latter maintained that he stood up to him (Timaya), and defended himself. Timaya had on Wednesday morning called out Franklin to focus on his career and alleged new job as a nanny. Timaya, who also threatened to beat up Franklin, reminded the record label boss of a similar incident in January 2021 when they got into a physical fight. In a post on his verified Twitter handle on Wednesday morning, Timaya wrote, “Ubi Franklin you remember the beating I gave you in January last year? Don’t let me beat you again, and please I like your new JOB. As Ifeanyi’s NANI and please don’t mess it up. Davido is a good guy he can make your life. Please focus on your new JOB. Thanks.” But countering Timaya’s claim, Franklin said he defended himself contrary to the singer’s claim, adding that given another circumstance, he will still defend himself. Giving his own account of what transpired during the 2021 encounter in a series of tweets, Franklin said he would provide the Close Circuit Television Camera footage of what happened during the said fight. He wrote, “I know because y’all see timaya act gangster you feel say him fit beat me 😂😂😂 No Wahala, I go find that CCTV footage from my oga house see how he knelt down to beg. He called me the next day to apologise cos he was high and attacked me unprovoked, self-defense came to play. “I made sure he got his, I wasn’t satisfied because they were too many Big Boys/men who knew he attacked me unprovoked because he was drunk and I did mine to fill gaps. I am not a violent person, but I will defend myself.” Franklin also said Timaya was bringing the encounter to the public domain because he had called him out over his (Timaya) recent hit-and-run controversy. Franklin tweeted, “Timaya is so petty. You are angry because I told how wrong it was to knock a woman down and leave her to her fate. “You come to talk trash here today? I am not a person that will see wrong and keep quiet. You were wrong to have knocked that woman down and left her there. Period.” The PUNCH had on March 2, 2022, reported how Timaya was accused of hitting a lady in the Ikate area of Lagos State. See their tweets below:    Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
