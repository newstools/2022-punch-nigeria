The Registrar of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, Prof Is-haq Oloyede, has appealed to owners of computer-based test centres to remain calm over the exorbitant price of diesel in the country. Oloyede made the appeal in a statement on Tuesday issued by JAMB’s Head of Public Relations and Protocol, Fabian Benjamin, four days to the closing date for the sale of the 2022/23 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination application form. The registrar spoke while on the last lap of the monitoring tour for the UTME/Direct Entry registration scheduled to end on Saturday. He disclosed that JAMB was in consultation with relevant government agencies to provide remedies as part of its strategies for a holistic solution. Oloyede reiterated the board’s desire to offer critical support to its service partners at every point of its operational processes. He admitted the heavy reliance on diesel-powered generators to administer the examination in many centres. “JAMB will always go the extra mile to render support to its critical partners such that no service provider will have any excuse for failure,” Oloyede stated. He gave an assurance of necessary palliatives to the CBT centres within the approved government limit. Oloyede reiterated that the closing date for the sale of the 2022/23 UTME application form to prospective candidates would not be extended. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
