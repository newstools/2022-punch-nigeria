Music superstars, Beyoncé and Billie Eilish, would perform their Oscar-nominated songs live at this year’s Academy Awards ceremony on March 27. Beyoncé would be singing “Be Alive,” a song she co-wrote for the movie “King Richard” about the father of tennis legends, Venus and Serena Williams, at the film industry honors on Sunday. Over the years, the Academy has shown its affection for Beyoncé as a performer. In 2005, the singer performed numerous tracks in the best song category on the live broadcast, including “Learn to Be Lonely” from the feature remake of “The Phantom of the Opera”. She sang alongside Jennifer Hudson and Anika Noni Rose in 2007 with a medley from “Dreamgirls”, and also in 2009 to accompany host Hugh Jackman in a montage celebrating movie musicals. Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas O’Connell would team for their James Bond theme “No Time to Die.” Country music star Reba McEntire would also take the stage to sing “Somehow You Do,” a song written by Diane Warren for the movie “Four Good Days.” “Dos Oruguitas” from animated musical “Encanto” would be performed Sebastian Yatra. All four would be competing in the category of best original song at the Academy Awards ceremony that would take place in Hollywood and be broadcast on Disney. The fifth nominee, “Down To Joy” from the movie “Belfast,” would not be performed during the telecast.
The organisers said that singer Van Morrison declined because of his tour schedule. NAN
