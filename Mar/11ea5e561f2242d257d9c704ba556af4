The Chairman, Nigerian Institution of Surveyors, Ekiti State Branch, Timothy Ajala, has canvassed for collaboration with the state government in the execution of all jobs that would need a surveyors’ professional contribution. Ajala said that apart from the quality delivery of the jobs in the interest of the development of the state, such collaboration would address the challenge of job creation for members in the state. The NIS chairman spoke in Ado Ekiti during the institution’s courtesy visit to the state’s Head of Service, Mrs Peju Babafemi. This was part of the programmes scheduled for the celebration of the 2022 Global Surveyors’ Day. This included the Sensitization Walk across various locations in the state capital. The Chairman of NIS bemoaned the menace of land grabbers, who he said attack surveyors in the state at will in the course of their job.  He said, “In addition, we face the challenge of the equipment that we are using. We are in the digital age, when you buy equipment today, in the next six months, it is already obsolete. With that, we need capital to get all this equipment. “Again, getting jobs that will be commensurate with the type of equipment that you are using is another thing. If you get equipment of N5million, N10million, you are now getting a job of N50,000, N100,000, when are you going to break even?’’  Contact: theeditor@punchng.com Copyright PUNCH.
