Former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Sunday narrated how the fear of cane made him to abandon Arabic school while he was young. Obasanjo, who holds doctoral degree in Christian Theology, spoke in Abeokuta during the inauguration and turbaning of Sheikh Salis Adenekan as the Grand Caliph of the Tijaniyyah for Yorubaland, Edo and Delta States. He said, “When I was young, I have told the story many times, that koboko (horsewhip) did not allow me to learn kewu (Arabic) effectively. “But despite that, I still remember many of those songs that we used to render.” Obasanjo told those present that as believers, they must all strive for Al-janat (paradise) as the final abode of the righteous. He submitted that whoever thinks of paradise as his or her final abode would not joke with his religious beliefs and practices. He added, “I am here to greet you. What we are gathered for has to do with religion. And one of our major goals, while living on earth is to make Al-janat. “Whoever knows there is Al-janat, he or she won’t joke about the religious practices during his or her sojourn on earth.”  Copyright PUNCH.
