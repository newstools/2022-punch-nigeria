Wilfred Ndidi could be out for a few weeks after suffereing a medial ligament injury in Leicester City’s Europa Conference League last-16 second leg clash against Rennes on Thursday, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The midfielder hurt his knee in a 50-50 challenge and was replaced by James Maddison on th ehour mark. Speaking ahead of City’s clash with Brentford on Sunday, Foxes coach Brendan Rodgers has said the Nigerian will now undergo scans to determine the extent of his spell on the sidelines. “Wilfred Ndidi, we just have to assess,”Rodgers said. “He picked up an injury that might keep him out for a few weeks, which is a shame. “Just as it looks like we’re getting players back. We’ve got a really good squad when they’re all available. It looks like we’ll get some back, but one or two might be out. We’ll have to see once the scans turn up later.” Rodgers also revealed that his compatriot Ademola Lookman is not 100 per cent fit despite featuring in the encounter. “Ricardo Pereira and Ademola Lookman put themselves out there against Rennes even though they weren’t 100 per cent and weren’t feeling well. They came into the game and gave their all for the team, so they should still be available for the game against Brendford.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
