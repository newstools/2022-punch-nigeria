… ahead of W’Cup qualifier With just four days to the crucial World Cup play-off against Ghana, Super Eagles head coach Austin Eguavoen is sweating over the fitness of Leicester City forward, Ademola Lookman, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Lookman, who is hoping to make his debut for Nigeria after FIFA approved his application to switch allegiance from England to Nigeria, was left out of the Foxes Premier League game against Brentford on Sunday. Since joining Leicester from Leipzig on loan, the 24-year-old has been an important player at the King Power Stadium and has made 31 appearances across all competitions, scoring six goals and providing five assists. On Thursday, he came on as a substitute for Marc Albrighton, who sustained a groin injury in their Europa Conference League round of 16 clash against Rennes. Speaking after their 2-1 win on Sunday, Rogers said the former England U-20 forward missed the clash against the Bees through illness. “Rodgers says Ademola Lookman missed the game through illness while Marc Albrighton will be back after the international break, after a slight groin issue,” BBC Sport Leicester tweeted after the game. Eguavoen will be hoping to have the forward available for the clash against Ghana, having also lost club teammate Wilfred Ndidi to injury.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
