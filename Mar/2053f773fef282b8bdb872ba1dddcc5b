The Lagos State chapter of the National Union of Road Transport Workers has warned its members against taking advantage of the situation in the union to embark on violence. The President of Lagos NURTW, Tajudeen Baruwa, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday and called on law enforcement agents to deal with any member causing problem in the state. Baruwa said “The union would not hesitate to punish any member found engaging in any activity that could tarnish the image of the group. Some members might want to capitalise on the situation in the union in Lagos to foment trouble, therefore, I call on law enforcement agencies to rise up to the occasion and ensure that whoever caused problems in the state was brought to justice. “The union under my leadership will not support thuggery and violent actions.” I am a man of peace and I will not hesitate to deal with members who try to cause confusion, no matter how highly placed the person is. Nobody is above the law. Efforts are ongoing to restore normalcy in the Lagos State council and the national secretariat of the union in Abuja is ready to find solution to the problem.” The PUNCH had reported that violent protests were reported in some areas of the state following the suspension of the state council’s chairman, Mr Musiliu Olusanya (MC Oluomo), and the decision of the Lagos State government to take over the state motor parks’ administration.
