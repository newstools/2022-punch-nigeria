Ahead of their mouth-watering World Cup play-off against Nigeria, Ghana will be without Crystal Palace forward Jordan Ayew after the player contracted COVID-19. Ayew was left out of Crystal Palace Emirates FA Cup quarter-final 4-0 win against Everton at Selhurst Park on Sunday. According to reports, the former Aston Villa forward has tested positive for COVID-19 and is all but set to miss out on the double encounter against Nigeria. The 30-year-old was initially named in the Palace squad ahead of the game, but was dropped after tests confirmed he was positive. The period of time an individual must spend in self-isolation varies, but, per NHS, Premier League players are expected to self isolate for 10 days. However, it is possible for an individual to come out of self-isolation after five days, provided they have two negative lateral flow tests, 24 hours apart. The stipulated date however means Ayew is likely to miss the World Cup play-offs between the two archrivals. The Black Stars will now be without the Ayew brothers for the doubleheader after Andre Ayew was ruled out due to suspension.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
