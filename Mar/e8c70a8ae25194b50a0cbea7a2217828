The Lagos State Government has commended the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency for its efforts towards making Lagos a drug-free state. According to a statement on Saturday, the Commissioner for Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Relations, Tayo Bamgbose-Martins, disclosed this when he received a team of Narcotics Officers on a courtesy visit to his office in Alausa, Ikeja. He said, “I applaud the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency for its fight against drug abuse towards making Lagos a drug-free state. I enjoin the agency to collaborate with relevant NGOs in order to eradicate drug-related menace in the country. “The ministry is saddled with the responsibility of supervising all emergencies and disaster management agencies in the state, and the state government, through the ministry, will do all within its power to support the organisation in actualising its set goals and objectives.” The NDLEA, Zone H Commander, Dr Segun Oke, requested for the help of the government in the areas of logistics. “The command was formed by the NDLEA Boss, Brigadier-General Buba Maruwa (retd.) to further strengthen and oversee Lagos and Ogun State Commands. However, I solicit for the state government’s intervention in the areas of logistics to aid the zone for improved surveillance and investigation,” he said.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
