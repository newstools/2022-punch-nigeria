A presidential aspirant under the platform of the Social Democratic Party, Adewole Adebayo, on Monday, said he would resolve the crisis between the Federal Government and Academic Staff Union of Universities if elected. He expressed optimism that SDP and other platforms working together would wrestle power from the All Progressives Congress in the 2023 presidential election. According to him, Nigerian leaders deliberately ignore solutions to the country’s problem because of self-service. Adebayo, who is also the Founder of Oak TV, expressed optimism after he declared his interest to contest for the 2023 presidential election under the platform of the SDP. He said, “I will resolve the issue as a President. It’s a problem that can be solved. Something can be done about it to put this strike issue to a stop. We have too much money, yet ASUU is on strike. I will ensure that the tertiary institutions are managed by academia. As long as the non-academic people continue to manage the Universities, we will continue to have problems. “Nigeria has so many problems but no solutions. The leaders know the solutions but they have deliberately ignored them, allowing the masses to suffer. “The solutions are known but the leaders have been shying away from them. Nigeria require leadership that is why we are contesting under the platform of the SDP to provide the desired leadership. “I am in the SDP to win the presidential election for Nigerians. When that happens, Nigerians will see and experience quality leadership.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
