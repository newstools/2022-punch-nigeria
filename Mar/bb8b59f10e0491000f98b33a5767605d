Former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, has declared his intention to contest the 2023 presidential election. He made the declaration in Awka while addressing the royal fathers and Presidents General of the 181 communities in the state at Government House, Awka. “I have come to inform you of my intention to contest the 2023 presidential election. I need your support,” he told the monarchs. The PUNCH gathered that Obi would officially declare his presidential ambition on Friday. This is the first time Obi would be speaking publicly about his intention to contest in 2023. He said, “We are all Nigerians and we know how things are shared in the country. Many people had called to ask my position on this matter and my answer then was that I needed to consult widely. “The reason I called you, therefore, is to officially inform you that I am aspiring for the president of Nigeria in 2023. “After a careful study of the country, I notice that we’re too divided and I promise to lead a united and secure Nigeria to be able to attract foreign investments. “The Nigeria I will lead will create jobs, boost our economy, improve education. If I have the opportunity, I will turn around the country for the better. “I will move Nigeria from a consuming nation to a productive nation. As a Nigerian, I want all parts of the country to be secured. I’m not aspiring for a political position, but to serve the country. “Let me assure you that I will seriously contest for the president of Nigeria on the platform of the PDP.” Details later… Copyright PUNCH.
