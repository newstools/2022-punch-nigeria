The former Director-General, National Emergency Management Agency, Alhaji Sani Sidi, has rejoined the Peoples Democratic Party. This is coming three years after Sidi left the PDP for the All Progressives Congress. Sidi had joined APC after losing PDP’s governorship ticket to Isa Ashiru in Kaduna. Sidi, who was a former gubernatorial aspirant in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), made his defection known at the PDP Kaduna central senatorial office on Saturday. He told the teeming supporters who stormed the party office, “There is no place like home and I am back home for good.” Sidi advised PDP at all levels to close ranks and unite so that the party can make progress at the local, state and federal levels. Speaking on his gubernatorial ambition, he said he is still consulting with party stakeholders, chieftains and loyalists and would soon make his intention known. “It is no longer a rumour, I have just declared my aspiration in my ward. I’m now a member of PDP. I’m just coming back home from my party. We are consulting with stakeholders on my aspiration. “The leaders and stakeholders of PDP need to unite otherwise we would not succeed. As politicians and members of PDP, we need to come together and unite for our party to progress and forge ahead,” he said.
