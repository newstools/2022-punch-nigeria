The Lagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, has assured residents that a committee would be set up by the government to take over garages and motor parks in the state. According to a statement on Thursday, Omotoso disclosed this during a Television Continental programme, ‘This Morning,’ where he allayed the fears expressed by citizens about boarding Bus Rapid Transit. He said, “The National Union of Road Transport Workers operates in a sector that has relevance to everybody living in Lagos, which is transportation. However, they are just a union of artisans and the likes, but not a force that cannot be controlled by the government. “I want to allay the fear of citizens as the government will set up a committee comprising stakeholders in the sector, who will take over the running of the motor parks and garages. “Let me also debunk the erroneous story being circulated on the social media about the union fighting back. I want to advise that our people should learn to take their information from credible sources to avoid misinformation.” The commissioner added that the governor has personally commiserated with the family of 22-year-old lady, Bamise, who disappeared after riding a BRT bus and was later found dead. “BRT buses are still very safe. Since the deployment of the cowry card in 2020, the buses have ferried over 40 million passengers. This is the first time this has happened and it is regrettable. The imported buses have cameras while the ones bought from local manufacturers do not have. However, the unfortunate incident has put the government on its toes to ensure that cameras are installed in the latter,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
