An artiste, Eche Abraham, has accused operatives of the Police Special Weapons and Tactics Team of extorting and assaulting him on his way to Okene in Kogi State. Abraham revealed that he was removed from the vehicle he was travelling on by the policemen and rather than taken to the police station as he requested, they took him to isolated places and was asked to pay N250, 000 for his freedom.
