A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress and Presidential hopeful, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, and the Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, on Friday met in Abuja. This was disclosed by the Special Assistant to the Governor of Ebonyi State, Francis Nwaze, who shared photos from the meeting. He, however, failed to reveal details of the meeting. “Presidential hopeful and Governor of Ebonyi State, Engr. David Umahi, FNSE, FNATE meets Alh. Bola Ahmed Tinubu in Abuja on Friday, March 11, 2022,” he wrote on Facebook. Tinubu and Umahi are among the APC members who will jostle to emerge as the Party’s flagbearer in the 2023 Presidential election. Tinubu had declared his ambition after paying a visit to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the State House in Abuja. Umahi also paid the President a visit, days after Tinubu’s visit, during which he declared interest in contesting in the 2023 Presidential election. More to follow…  Copyright PUNCH.
