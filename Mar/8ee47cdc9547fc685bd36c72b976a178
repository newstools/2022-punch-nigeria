Reality TV star, Kim Kardashian, has been legally declared single, one year after filing for divorce from rapper, Kanye West. In her petition to be declared single filed back in December, the SKIMS founder requested that the court separate issues of child custody and property from her marital status. However, in February, her petition was challenged by West who claimed that the declaration might have adverse consequences, especially pertaining to the custody of their four children, and marital assets. Kim responded by saying she very much desired to be divorced because West refused to keep their divorce private. She also accused him of misinforming the public about their family matters. “I ask that the Court restore me to the status of a single person so that I can begin the healing process and so that our family can begin the healing process and move forward in this new chapter in our lives,” she wrote. Page Six reports that Judge Steven Cochran of Los Angeles Superior Court declared Kim single during a hearing on Wednesday. West had made several public pleas for his family to be reunited since the news of their divorce broke in February 2021. However, things took a turn in October after Kim’s romance with Saturday Night Live comedian, Pete Davidson became public. West had threatened to beat up Davidson and also made several posts attacking the comedian on his official Instagram page in February. The rapper himself has been sighted with other women after the split, including actress, Julia Fox, whom he dated for two months. Ye has most recently been sighted with model, Chenay Jones, and he seemingly confirmed their romance by posting a picture of them together on his Instagram page. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
