FARMCROWDY, a global agri-tech firm focused on solving inefficiencies in the food value chain, has announced that Onyeka Akumah has stepped down as the chairman and shareholder at the company. A statement by the company said Akumah’s exit from the company followed the expiration of his five-year tenure as chairman. Farmcrowdy initially started out as a crowdfunding business which focused on boosting food security in Nigeria. The statement added that during his tenure at Farmcrowdy, Onyeka led the company through significant milestones which include closing a whopping $2.4m in equity investments, acquiring Best Foods in 2020 and changing the way Africans saw agriculture with his famous quote that “Agriculture is trendy for young people to build businesses.” Speaking on his exit from the company, Akumah said; “My tenure at Farmcrowdy was a very challenging and fulfilling time which saw so much sacrifice, sleepless nights, hectic travel schedules, fun, tears, laughter, innovation, creativity and time spent building one of the most respected brands in the agriculture and technology space in Africa. “The implication of this is that I no longer have ties with Farmcrowdy and going forward, it will be led and managed by Akindele Phillips and Ifeanyi Anazodo. I wish them well as they build the next chapter of the company.” According to the statement, Akumah will continue to lecture at the Rome Business School where he teaches on Entrepreneurship & Marketing to MBA students. With his background in Software Engineering and over 16 combined years of experience in the corporate and startup world including Deloitte, British Council and GTBank, Onyeka is famous for his early foray in the startup world.
