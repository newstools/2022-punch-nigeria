Regulators in the European Union and United Kingdom have opened antitrust probes into Google and Meta, formerly Facebook, over the tech giants’ 2018 ad deal. The parallel probes will look at whether the so-called ‘Jedi Blue’ agreement between the two companies hampered competition in markets for online display advertising services. Online display ads are graphic ads that appear on websites, mobile apps and social media. According to CNBC, the Chief Executive Officer of the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority, Andrea Coscelli, said, “We’re concerned that Google may have teamed up with Meta to put obstacles in the way of competitors who provide important online display advertising services to publishers. “If one company has a stranglehold over a certain area, it can make it hard for start-ups and smaller businesses to break into the market – and may ultimately reduce customer choice.” The regulator said it wants to determine whether the tech giants restricted or prevented the uptake of header bidding services, which enable news publishers to sell their online advertising space to multiple buyers at the same time, rather than receiving offers individually. A Meta spokesperson said, “Meta’s non-exclusive bidding agreement with Google and the similar agreements we have with other bidding platforms, have helped to increase competition for ad placements. These business relationships enable Meta to deliver more value to advertisers and publishers, resulting in better outcomes for all. We will cooperate with both inquiries.”
