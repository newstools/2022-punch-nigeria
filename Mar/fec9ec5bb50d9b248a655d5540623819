A former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, has called out the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) over a $1m gift to Afghanistan by the president amidst the deteriorating security in the country, particularly the recent Kaduna train attack. The socio-political activist noted that such an amount that was given to Afghanistan could have been spent on security in Nigeria and could have prevented an incident like the Abuja-Kaduna train attack. Omokri, in his tweets on Wednesday, said, “Dear Buhari, Just this month you gave $1 million to the terrorist government of Afghanistan. That money could have bought 10 bomb detectors for the Abuja-Kaduna rail. You spent $8 million on repentant Boko Haram. Wouldn’t that have been best spent on bomb detectors?” He said that Buhari had 10 Presidential jets and more than 10 Mercedes Benzes worth over ₦1 billion, but could not provide even one bomb detector for the Abuja-Kaduna rail, six months after it was first bombed on October 22, 2022. “Nigeria has 2 terrorists. Buhari and the bandits,” he tweeted. Omokri also said, “The machine that would have detected bombs on the Abuja-Kaduna rail tracks cost about ₦180 million. Yet, the Buhari regime did not purchase it. But Buhari spent over ₦200 million buying a bullet proof Mercedes Maybach for himself. Buhari cares only about himself!” He added, “How many people did IPOB kill before Buhari threatened them with his now infamous ‘speak to them in a language they understand’ tweet? How come he has not spoken to terrorists in the same language? Is it because they are from his tribe, and not a dot in a circle?” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
