The Ogun State Government says it will ensure that builders involved in shady practices leading to any building collapse in the state loses their licences. It threatened that it would begin to report any unprofessional conduct of builders to appropriate professional and registration bodies for necessary disciplinary action. The state Commissioner for Physical and Urban Development, Olatunji Odunlami, said this during the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Building Collapse Prevention Guild. According to him, the MoU is part of the state’s effort to provide a solution to the rising cases of collapsed building and to formalise the inauguration of the guild to serve as a whistle-blower for the state government. He said, “Your professionalism, probity and licence are now on the line, and you will be held to account. “We will not hesitate to report any unprofessional conduct to the appropriate professional and registration bodies of your members for necessary action. “For the inability and lack of adequate capacity, indeed bothering on inefficiency, which has provided opportunities for virtually everyone that is involved construction site, to perpetrate legalities: from the owner/developer to artisans to material suppliers, and sadly to registered professionals who owe the immediate responsibility and duty to ensure that such illegalities are not perpetrated.” According to Odunlami, gross misconduct in the construction sector is the leading cause of building collapses. He added that the guild would help to verify the qualifications of builders.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
