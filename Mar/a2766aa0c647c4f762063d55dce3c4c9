This comes barely 10 days after being declared single following her one-year divorce battle with her estranged husband and American superstar, Kanye West. Judge Steven Cochran of Los Angeles Superior Court declared Kim single during a hearing on Wednesday, March 2, 2022, granting her the permission to return to her maiden name. Shortly after that, she removed the surname of her estranged husband, Kanye West, from her social media profiles.
