We have a brand new episode of our news review show to start off the week. As the world celebrated Mother’s Day on Sunday, an Ogun mum, Aisha Tijani, is in remand for setting her own child ablaze. Tijani, who poured petrol on her child and set her ablaze, said that she didn’t know what came over her when she carried out the act. If you have for one moment thought that beggars may actually be ‘cashing out’, the ones in Tika town, Kenya, confirmed it. Asides from pretending disabilities, these beggars revealed that they earn more than some of the persons they beg from. They also revealed some of their trade secrets…want to find out what those are? Watch till the end. From prison beauty pageantry to inmates graduating at the top of their classes in the National Open University of Nigeria, it’s safe to say, ‘things dey occur’ in Nigeria’s correctional facilities.
