The Nigeria Football Federation has tendered an apology to the Federal Government and Nigerians for the failure of the Super Eagles to qualify for this year’s World Cup finals in Qatar. NFF General Secretary, Dr Mohammed Sanusi, regretted that the team failed to qualify despite the enormous support of government and Nigerians, who turned out in throngs to fill up the 60,491-capacity Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja for the clash with Ghana’s Black Stars on Tuesday. “There was nothing the team needed that was lacking. The Government provided necessary support; the NFF put all logistics in place with the active support of the sports ministry and Nigerians turned out en masse to support the team. The truth is that we left nothing to chance. It is sad that things turned out the way they did. “Sport is about winning and losing. Nobody wants to lose but sometimes it happens that way. We are quite sad that despite playing a draw in Kumasi, the Super Eagles could not win here in Abuja. We apologise unreservedly to the Government and people of Nigeria for this non-qualification.” The Super Eagles could only achieve a score draw (1-1) against the Black Stars, which ended their hopes of playing at the World Cup finals in Qatar as Ghana sneaked through on the away-goal rule.
