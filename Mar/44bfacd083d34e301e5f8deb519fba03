THE Osun State Government has threatened to launch war on illegal mining in the state. The state stated that illegal miners are destroying its environment and polluting the Osun River. According to it, it is ready to ensure that miners resisting guidance and not following its approved standards for mining get sanctioned. This was disclosed in a statement by the Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Funke Egbemode on Wednesday. According to her, the government is warning natives from leasing their farmlands to illegal miners or face the law. She said, “Osun State Government is worried and deeply concerned about the flagrant abuse of its environment by illegal miners who are daily degrading and polluting the Osun River. “In spite of efforts to curb the excesses of these fly-by-night businessmen, they have consistently resisted guidance and refused to follow approved standards for mining in Osun. “It has therefore become imperative to serve them the last warning here and now. The state will no longer fold its hands while these miners (both legal and illegal) throw caution to the winds and ruin one of our heritage sites. “Osun River is not just a geographical landmark. It is one of the few accredited UNESCO sites in Nigeria. It is our heritage; one we will do everything to protect and preserve. “Illegal Miners are therefore served a notice to shape in or ship out. If they cannot operate within the ambits of World Standards and observe safety protocols, they may have to take their business elsewhere.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
