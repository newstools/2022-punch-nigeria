Veteran Nollywood actor, Pete Edochie, on the occasion of his 75th birthday has stated that age was not just a number; as the popular saying went. In a video posted on his Instagram handle on Monday, Edochie stated that attaining the age of 75 was not an easy feat, adding that those who said age was just a number should undergo “psychiatric evaluation”. He also gave thanks to God for making him live to the age of 75, noting that many of his colleagues whom he started with had died. He said, “75 is not a small age. How does it feel being 75? You know, I have heard a lot of people say age is just a number. Anybody who says age is just a number should subject himself to psychiatric evaluation because as you age, you feel it within yourself, but you try as much as possible not to allow it to weigh you down. “So, I want to start by thanking the almighty God for helping me get this far, most of my colleagues who started with me are no longer there, may their souls rest in peace.” The Nollywood legend, however, noted the challenges that came with ageing stating that the elderly were prone to many medical issues due to their age. “It is not easy being 75, you are prone to several medical challenges, but you just have to keep moving on but I’m happy that my faculty is still complete, so once more, I thank the almighty God,” Edochie added.
