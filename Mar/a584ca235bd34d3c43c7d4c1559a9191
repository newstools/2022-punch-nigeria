The Nigerian Navy said it has arrested a vessel named Motor Tanker Harbor Spirit and 13 persons on board. The Navy, according to a statement by its spokesperson, Ayotunde said the vessel was conveying a fortified and auctioned crude oil from MV KOME XVIII with a forged document. He added that both the vessel and the suspects have been handed over to the Forward Operating Base Bonny for further investigation. The arrest is coming barely two days after the arrest of MT Queen of Peace for unauthorised possession of petroleum products without valid documents. The statement was titled, ‘Exercise Obangame Express: Arrest of MT Harbor Spirit Near Bonny Fairway Buoy’. It partly read, “On Day 7 of the Exercise  Obangame Express, Nigerian Navy Ship Thunder intercepted MOTOR TANKER (MT) HARBOR SPIRIT (A Vessel of Interest) at about 1030 on Thursday 17 March 2022, on suspicion of engaging in illegal activities. “The vessel was subsequently boarded by the Nigerian Navy and she was discovered to be in possession of forged documents for the evacuation of fortified and auctioned product (crude oil) from MV KOME XVIII. “Accordingly, MT Harbor Spirit and her crew of 13 men, all Nigerians, were arrested and handed over to Forward Operating Base Bonny for further investigation and possible handover for prosecution.” Copyright PUNCH.
