The traditional rulers in Delta State are divided over the planned summit to discuss the zoning of the governorship seat in the state. Rising from its meeting, the Chairman of the Delta State Traditional Rulers Council and Orodje of Okpe, Maj Gen Felix Mujakpuerou (retd.), disclosed this shortly after the end of the council meeting in Asaba. The Asagba of Asaba, Prof Choke Edozie, had last week said that the traditional rules were preparing to hold a summit to discuss the burning issue of power rotation among the three senatorial districts in the state. The Asagba who spoke through the Obi of Abavo, Uche Erenumah, said the move had become necessary to douse the political tension in the state. But the Orodje of Okpe, flanked by the first Vice Chairman, Pere Luke Kalanama VIII, and second Vice Chairman, Agbogidi Henry Kikachukwu 1, alleged that the traditional rulers were not apolitical and that there was no basis for the convocation of such a summit. Mujakpuerou disclosed that the council was unaware of such a move, adding that the exalted traditional institution should not be dragged into politics. He said, “The council is not aware of such a move by the highly exalted traditional rulers institution and it should not be dragged into politics. “The traditional rulers will continue to work and cooperate with any government in power for the growth, peace and development of Delta State.” Copyright PUNCH.
