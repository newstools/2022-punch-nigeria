One-cap Super Eagles forward, Anthony Nwakaeme, is Nigeria’s second highest goal scorer in the Turkish Super Lig and 135th on the list of all-time top scorers after almost four years at title-chasing Trabzonspor. Nwakaeme has scored 39 league goals in 113 games since joining from Israeli side Hapoel Be’ér Sheva in the summer of 2018 for €1.1m. The current season has been his best, having scored 11 goals and 10 assists in 23 league games. In the 2018/19 season he scored 10 goals providing 10 assists. He grabbed 11 goals and nine assists in the 2019/20 season as Trabzonspor staged a strong fight for the league title. He scored seven goals and seven assists in 34 games in the 2020/21 season from 34 appearances. Nwakaeme’s record is only second to that of late former Nigeria youth captain, Isaac Promise, who played for six different clubs in 11 seasons. Promise scored a total 65 goals and 30 assists in 271 games. His best season was in the 2005/06 campaign, when he scored 12 goals and provided two assists in 33 games.  Copyright PUNCH.
