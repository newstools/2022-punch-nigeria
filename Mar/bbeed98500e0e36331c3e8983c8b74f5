The Executive Secretary of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency, Faisal Shuaib, on Tuesday, said the government would invest in building up the failing primary health care system in the country so that primary health centres could treat infectious diseases as well as address chronic illnesses. Shuaib stated that the government would ensure the provision of equipment, availability of drugs and procurement of ambulances for the PHCs, among others. The regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had earlier promised the revitalisation of primary healthcare facilities in the country. In 2021, it was reported that no fewer than 918 primary healthcare centres were shut across the country amidst the outbreak of cholera. Speaking at a press conference on the PHC summit held in Abuja on Tuesday, Shuaib, who admitted the failing primary healthcare system in the country, noted that the goals of rehabilitation were ambitious. He stated, “The pandemic meant increased global interest and scrutiny of our health system, but here in Nigeria, we’ve long known that the wide-reaching devastating problems and now we are driving through solutions. “We have proven that we know how to solve complex health problems when they are made a priority by governments, multilateral organisations and the private sector. We will build on our national experience fighting COVID-19, Ebola, polio and many other health challenges. “We will invest in building up our failing PHC system so that it can treat infectious diseases as well as address chronic illness; handle prevention, diagnosis and referral; maternal and child-care and community wellness.” Copyright PUNCH.
