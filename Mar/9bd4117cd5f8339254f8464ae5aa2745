Bala Nikyu, head coach of Nigeria Professional Football League side, Nasarawa United, has rued his team’s luck following their match-day 18 1-1 draw against MFM FC at the Lafia Township Stadium, Lafia on Sunday. The draw means Nasarawa have failed to win in front of their fans in two consecutive games, and are also without a win in their last four league matches. Chukwudi Ekeocha gave the visitors a lead just two minutes into the game before Aliyu Abdullahi levelled the score for the hosts in first half added time. Despite a dominant performance from Nikyu’s men after the restart, they were unable to break down the resolute MFM defence, with Nikyu still in awe how his side didn’t win a game they largely dominated. “Football at times can be very funny. MFM don’t look like a team that can cause us any trouble, but that is the game for you, it’s a funny game,” he said. “There is no issue of disappointment, but at times something like this happens. “If anybody had told MFM that they could hold us for 90 minutes, they won’t believe it as well. But we just have to go out in our next game and make up for the dropped points.” Up next for Nasarawa is a trip to Ibadan, where they face a tough test against Shooting Stars in their match-day 19 of the 2021/22 NPFL season.
