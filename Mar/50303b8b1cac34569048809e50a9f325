An Information and Communication Technology company, 21st Century Technologies Limited, has agreed to a deal with a Germany-based energy company-Siemens Energy-to build two turbine power plants for its data centre facilities in Lagos. According to the firm, the turbine plants will be stationed at its centres sited in Ikeja and Lekki. It added that the power project, which will be ready for installation and inauguration by the fourth quarter of 2022, would run on gas, diesel, and hydrogen. In a statement, 21st Century Technologies Chief Executive Officer, Wale Ajisebutu, said the project was part of the organisation’s expansion plans to enable it to seamlessly and efficiently manage communications networks across the country and beyond. He said, “We built the first data centre in Nigeria in 2004.  We are very proud indeed to mention that the facility has been successfully running for the last 18 years. “Many thanks to our team, technical partners such as Schneider Electric and numerous customers for the trust repose in us. Their support and best wishes will forever remain a source of encouragement to our entire team. “On our new project, we are greatly inspired by Siemens Energy’s readiness and commitment to our project in building the most sustainable data centre in this part of the world.
