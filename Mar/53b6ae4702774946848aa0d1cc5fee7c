A young man was on Thursday burnt alive in Bayelsa State. The incident happened at Swali community in the Yenagoa Local Government Area of the state. An account of the incident noted that the young man was set ablaze by an angry mob after he was caught during an armed robbery operation in the area, while three other gang members escaped. However, the police said the young man was a suspected cultist and was set ablaze by some members of a rival cult group. This was contained in a statement titled, ‘Death of a suspected cultist’, issued by a spokesman for the State Police Command, SP Asinim Butswat. Butswat said, “On the 26 March 2022, at about 0630 hours, policemen responded to a distress call of cult-related clashes at Sand Road, Swalli, Yenagoa.
