Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), has urged a national chairmanship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress, Senator Sani Musa, to continue with his consultations and not get distracted. According to a statement on Wednesday, the governor spoke when he received Musa and members of his team who paid him a courtesy visit at the Government House, Akure. The governor was quoted as saying that the APC needs a national chairman who is energetic, accessible and people-oriented. Musa was said to have visited Akeredolu, who is also the Chairman of the South West Governors’ Forum, in continuation of his consultation with governors and stakeholders of the APC on his ambition. The statement read, “Governor Akeredolu who harped on the leadership qualities expected of the potential chairmanship candidate of the APC, stressed that the ruling party at this crucial stage will do well to avoid candidates with predetermined ulterior motives for the party even before they assume leadership. “The governor who hailed the intellectual audacity of Senator Musa described him as the kind of leader the party needed now for the APC to progress as they approach 2023 general elections. “Governor Akeredolu disclosed that he is not against the APC zoning of offices once they are done to reflect equity, fairness and justice as he further encouraged Senator Sani Musa to continue with his consultations with leaders and stakeholders within the party stating that ‘it is not over until it is over.’” Musa, in his speech, solicited the support of the governor on his ambition ahead of the party’s national convention scheduled for March 26.
