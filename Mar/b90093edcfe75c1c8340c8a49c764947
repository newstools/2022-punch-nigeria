The Lagos State Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture has partnered with Content Warehouse to host Kampus Stars— a reality show that would involve tertiary institutions in the state. As part of efforts to broaden opportunities for young Nigerians in the entertainment industry, the ministry in conjunction with the organisation has decided to create an avenue that would boost both the academic and entertainment morale of students across Lagos State’s tertiary institutions. Speaking at an event to announce the show, the Commissioner for Tourism, Arts and Culture, Uzamat Akinbile-Yusuf, said the project would help discover talented and creative minds in various higher institutions of learning. She said, “We are using this event to further build on the inherent creativity of the people of Lagos and establish the state as a vibrant and innovative tourism destination that creates jobs across multiple tourism segments and offers the world access to the ingenuity and hospitality of its residents. “According to statistics, youths account for over 65 per cent of the nation’s population and this further makes it more compelling for government to make necessary provisions for this segment of society by harnessing their creative talents, while also meeting their employability needs.” The winner of the show will go home with a cash prize of N10m and a new car.
