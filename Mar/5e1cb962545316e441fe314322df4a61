American cybercrime expert, Gary Warner, has revealed that the document which claimed that an alleged international Internet fraudster Ramon Abbas, aka, Hushpuppi, laundered $400,000 in prison was fake. Warner, the Director of Research in Computer Forensics at the University of Alabama, noted that the document was an edited version of a June 2020 affidavit. On his Twitter page, Warner disclosed that the new version of the document “was intended to get people to visit a scammer EIP website.” He wrote, “People are asking me if it is true that #Hushpuppi laundered $400,000 in #Stimulus cards from in prison. “The document they show is an edit of a June 2020 Affidavit. The new version is fake, intended to get people to visit a scammer EIP website.” This came shortly after a purported document, which went viral on Thursday morning, showed that Hushpuppi, who was currently on trial, laundered $400,000 in prison. Hushpuppi’s trial, which was initially scheduled for Valentine’s Day, had been moved to July 11, 2022. In a plea agreement document sighted by The PUNCH, Hushpuppi had pleaded guilty to various offences bordering on internet scam and money laundering, among others. It stated that Hushpuppi risks “20 years’ imprisonment; a 3-year period of supervised release; a fine of $500,000 or twice the gross gain or gross loss resulting from the offence”. Copyright PUNCH.
