The Nigeria Police Force has reiterated the ban on officers across the country from demanding Customs papers from drivers. In a tweet on Sunday, Force Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, also said officers should stop demanding tinted glass permit. According to him, tinted glass permit remains suspended across the country. He tweeted, “No policeman should demand your customs papers. Except they are on joint operation, but not just on mere routine checks. “We have suspended issuance of tinted glass permits, so we don’t expect our men to disturb Nigerians on this. “We are to stop any vehicle with tints, search the vehicles, and its occupants, but not to delay for not having tinted glass permits.”
