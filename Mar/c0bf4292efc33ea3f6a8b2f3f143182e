A bus driver was confirmed dead in an accident at Nkwelle Junction on Onitsha-Nteje Expressway in Anambra on Friday. The Federal Road Safety Corps in the state, through its Sector Commander, Mr Adeoye Irelewuyi, confirmed the incident to the News Agency of Nigeria in Awka. Irelewuyi said the accident occurred at about 7 am on Friday. He attributed the accident to reckless “wrongful overtaking” by the bus driver, which unfortunately claimed the lives of three male adults. “The fatal crash involved a commercial Mark Tanker with registration number: ENU224YY and a private Toyota Hiace Bus with registration number: GWA25TM. “According to an eyewitness account, the bus driver overtook wrongfully without knowing there was a broken-down pick-up vehicle ahead. “While trying to dodge the pick-up, he rammed into the tanker and crashed,” the corps boss explained. The FRSC rescue team from Nteje Unit Command had swooped into action by rushing the victims to Chira Hospital, Awkuzu, where the bus driver was later confirmed dead. His body has since been deposited at a mortuary in Awkuzu. The sector commander said that officials of the FRSC were on high alert to manage the traffic and also ensure the obstruction caused by the crash was cleared. The FRSC, while sympathising with the family of the dead, urged motorists to refrain from wrongful overtaking, and be vigilant while driving.
