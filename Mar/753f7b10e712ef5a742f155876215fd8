FORMER Delta State Governor, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan, on Thursday said he has not quit politics, contrary to media reports suggesting otherwise. Uduaghan made the clarification in a statement made available to our correspondent by his media assistant, Monoyo Edon, in Warri. Edon insisted that the reports, which emanated from the Press Week of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, Warri Correspondents’ Chapel, on Wednesday did not reflect the true position of what Uduaghan said in his lecture titled “2023 elections and role of the media.” Copyright PUNCH.
