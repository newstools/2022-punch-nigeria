Former President General of apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo, has said he didn’t at any point said he would deal with gunmen should they attempt to attack his country home. Nwodo stated this in a statement he personally signed, asking the public to discard as untrue reports (not by The PUNCH), claiming otherwise. Gunmen had on Saturday razed the country home of the Nwodo’s successor, Prof George Obiozor, at Awo-Omamma in the Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State. The attackers, who arrived at the Igbo leader’s home in vehicles, reportedly threw explosive devices at the house, causing untold damage. Nwodo said, “My attention has been drawn to a news item circulating in the social media in Nigeria, quoting me as saying that I will deal with gunmen if they try to burn my house. “Since I left the Ohanaeze Presidency after a successful tenure, I have been deliberately away from media glare for the obvious reason of allowing my successor to own the media space. I rarely appear in public outings except for where it’s inevitable. I had also turned down several media approaches for interviews as a result of this principled position. “I have been outside the country for over one week for medical checkups, yet the mischief-maker(s) chose to put words in my mouth as speaking to newsmen in Enugu. “There is no doubt in my mind that those behind this cheap blackmail are engaged in devious act to not only dent my image by continuously dragging my name negatively but working assiduously to find an alibi to burn down my house and possibly attack my person. “Those behind this dangerous act will definitely face the law of the land and of God who detest the destruction of a person’s hard-earned reputation unjustly.”
