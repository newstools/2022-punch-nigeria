Former Super Eagles captain Austin Okocha says the goalless draw between Ghana and Nigeria at the filled 40,528-capacity Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi in their Qatar 2022 World Cup play-off was fair for both teams. Speaking after the game, Okocha praised the team for their composure despite the overwhelming home crowd. “We couldn’t separate both teams because nobody wanted to lose, no one wanted to go into the second leg of this tie chasing, so, I think the result was a fair one, I think we (Nigeria) did a good job in front of the home crowd,” Okocha, a pundit for the game, said. “We were totally dominated in terms of the support. I think we have given ourselves a good chance going into the second leg.” Okocha added that winning the second leg is a must for the Eagles. “I think if we can’t win the second leg in Abuja, then we don’t have a reason to be at the World Cup. I don’t think there’s a better advantage than to win and qualify for the World Cup in front of the home fans.”  Contact: theeditor@punchng.com Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
