The Unified Northern Nigeria Youth Forum on Thursday called on Nigerians to support the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr Godwin Emefiele, to take over from the President, Major General Muhammadu  Buhari (retd.), in 2023. At a press conference in Jalingo, the spokesperson of the group, Mr Aliyu Muhammad said Nigeria needs a versatile leader who has a mastery of the economy and is a servant of the people to continue with the legacies of the President. According to the group, “Nigeria needs a surgeon in human upliftment and empowerment; a statesman in national affairs; a figure with full knowledge of international trade who believes in the oneness, unity and brotherhood of the country like Dr Godwin Emefiele. “We need a new kind of leader that is detribalized, a leader that will serve as a symbol of unity. We need a leader who can sacrifice his sleep, his comfort and life for the masses of this country and Emefiele has demonstrated that as a CBN Governor.” “Emefiele has brought policies that have better the lives of poor Northerners. He has shown love to our people and we want to call on him to contest for President of this country in 2023. “Emefiele has written his name in the heart of Northerners due to his undying contributions in eradicating poverty and uplifting millions out of poverty,” Muhammad stated.
