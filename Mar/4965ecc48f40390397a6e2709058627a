The Governor-elect of Anambra State, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, has been described as a positive and new face of politics in Nigeria, South-East and Anambra State. The Universal Prayer Fellowship, East Mandate Global and Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, stated this during the ‘Alaigbo Sunrise Prayer and Thanksgiving Crusade,’ in Awka, on Sunday. The conveners of the three-day intercessory prayers and thanksgiving crusade, Evang. Iwuchukwu Ezenwafor of the Universal Prayer Fellowship, Abuja and the Bishop, East Mandate Global, Enugu, Apostle Ofodile Ikenna Nzimiro, said Anambra would be in safe hands with Soludo. The Christian groups said Soludo would reposition Anambra State. According to Nzimiro, “Anambra is already a blessed land; the state is like the first son in Igboland and in reality, Anambra has been blessed with good governors, but I want to assure you that Soludo, as I see in heaven, is supposed to do better than all of them.” Copyright PUNCH.
