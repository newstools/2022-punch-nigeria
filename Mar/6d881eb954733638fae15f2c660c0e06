The Anambra State Commissioner of Police, Echeng Echeng, has ordered the deployment of personnel of the State Intelligence Bureau across the state. Addressing journalists in Awka on Monday, the police spokesman, Ikenga Tochukwu, said the move followed information received of planned attacks by gunmen on vigilantes in the state. There have been reported cases of hoodlums combing some communities in the state in search of weapons. According to reports, the gang, identified as Umu Oma, goes from house to house of vigilantes to collect their arms. They were said to have recently operated in some communities, including Ezinifite, Lilu, Amaruru, Orsumogu and Ihiala. The police spokesperson, while soliciting the cooperation of residents, advised them to always call the police whenever they observed any suspicious moves by “unscrupulous” elements. He said, “Following the information received of planned attacks by some unscrupulous elements on the vigilante members in the state, the Commissioner of Police, Echeng Echeng, has urged residents and indigenes to come forward with information to unmask the identities of these bad elements/persons. “Also, the CP ordered the immediate deployment of State Intelligence Bureau personnel of the command to gather intelligence to complement the existing operational personnel/assets already deployed within many areas of the state. “The command assures that the police and other security agents are more committed to providing security services to everyone and all stakeholders in the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
