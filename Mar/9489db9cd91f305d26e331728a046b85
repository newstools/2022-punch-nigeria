Justice Okon Abang of a Federal High Court in Abuja has granted the application by businessman Jimoh Ibrahim and his firms to publish a notice of committal proceedings against the Managing Director of the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria, Ahmed Kuru and two other officials of AMCON. This comes less than two weeks after the court granted permission to Ibrahim and his firms – NICON  Investment Limited, NICON Insurance Limited and NICON Reinsurance Corporation Plc – to commence committal proceedings against the AMCON boss and two Executive Directors, Aminu Ismail and Eberechukwu Uneze, for allegedly flouting the court’s earlier orders. Justice Abang ruled that the publication constitutes proper service of Forms 48 and 49 and all other court processes to be issued in the matter. The court based its decision on the grounds that the defendants evaded personal service of the contempt proceedings. Justice Abang also maintained that the appeal filed against the previous order by the defendants did not follow the correct process. Justice Abang specifically stated that since the respondents didn’t file a motion of stay of execution on the order made of March 9, 2022, it could not operate as a stay of execution. He granted that the applicants should publish forms 48 and 49 and other court’s processes to be lawfully issued in the matter in two nation’s national dailies, The Nation and The Punch newspapers.
