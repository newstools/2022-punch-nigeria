London-based Nigerian Disk Jockey, Florence Otedola popularly known as DJ Cuppy, on Monday stated that she had to quit DJing for a while to help her focus on her study at the University of Oxford. In a series of videos on her Instagram story, Cuppy said that if she hadn’t stopped DJing, she wouldn’t have been able to overcome the pressure of studying at Oxford. According to her, one of the reasons she struggled with schooling was because she had to pause her music career. She said, “I feel like the worst part of struggling with academics in Oxford is the fact that I haven’t been able to do what I love. “I love music. I love DJing. I love working, and it’s been hard. I’m really proud of myself for sticking through and I cannot wait to get back to DJing and get back to being Cuppy again. “A lot of people ask me what my advice is, for people who do not want to be put in one box and pursue things outside their usual career. “My advice is focus. You have to focus. If I didn’t stop DJing, then I wouldn’t have been able to take on the pressure and requirements Oxford has on me.” While revealing that she was in her final week in school, the entrepreneur who said she had not had any DJ gig for 2022, noted that she was now open to receiving jobs.
