A real estate firm, UPDC Plc, has announced the development of a new housing project. It said it was also in the process of building a team of professionals with several years of in-country and international experience in the industry to steer it in the path of growth. In a statement, the company said, “The company will also be unveiling several exciting new residential development projects in the course of the year.” The Chief Executive Officer, UPDC, Mr Odunayo Ojo, said, “The project, which is essentially a fully gated site and service scheme located in Lekki, next to the existing Pinnock Beach Estate, will be served with ultra-modern infrastructure and amenities. “The estate occupies a land area of 1.47 hectares and will be delineated along the lines of high- and low-density plots. With each plot measuring between 500 – 1000 square metres, buyers will be allowed to develop their plots in line with UPDC’s approved building guidelines.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
