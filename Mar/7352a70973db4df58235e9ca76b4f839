DUBBED the ‘super sub’ by fans in Belgium, Nigeria international Cyriel Dessers continues his impressive form coming off the bench in the Dutch Eredivise. Dessers scored against FC Groningen on Saturday to enter into Feyenoord’s history books. After missing out on the club’s last two games through injury, the striker made a return to Feyenoord’s squad and was introduced into the game nine minutes into the second half with his side 1-0 down. Dessers repaid his manager’s faith as he grabbed an equaliser after 15 minutes on the pitch, heading home a cross from Fredrik Aursnes to level the score for the hosts. The goal, according to the statisticians at OPTA, makes the Nigerian just the second player to have scored five goals coming off the bench for Feyenoord in a single season. “Cyriel Dessers is the second player ever to score five goals for @Feyenoord after coming on as a sub in a single Eredivisie season, after József Kiprich in 1992/93. Supersub,” OptaJohan wrote on Twitter. Dessers’s four other goals as substitutes were scored against PSV Eindhoven, NEC Nijmegen, Sparta Rotterdam and AZ Alkmaar. The 27-year-old striker, who is on loan from Genk, has scored 11 goals and created three assists in the 32 matches he has played so far this season.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
