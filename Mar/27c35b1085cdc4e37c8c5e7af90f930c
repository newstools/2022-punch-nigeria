Two hundred teachers and six inspectors of education bagged certificates in the Seplat Teachers Empowerment Programme which ended in Benin at the weekend. The programme had participants from Edo and Delta States and it was aimed at improving the standard of education in Nigeria, especially in Seplat Energy’s host states and communities, with the use of technology. In his keynote address, an Independent Non-Executive Director at Seplat Energy, Prof. Fabian Ajogwu (SAN), urged stakeholders to collectively improve the fortune of education in the country. He said, “Education is a collective responsibility. What Seplat Energy is doing is noble and commendable. It is supported by both Edo and Delta State Governments.” “These states should be model states that should be emulated. Other corporate organisations should also be invited to do the same. Spending on education gives us future returns than subsiding consumption. “We believe that empowering teachers is the first point to awakening education and education has a cost. What we have done is to take part of that cost. The government has a role to play as well as other organisations and stakeholders. We should acknowledge this cost and invest in it.”  Copyright PUNCH.
