The Lagos State High Court sitting at Tafawa Balewa Square has fixed May 9, for the commencement of trial of the driver of the Bus Rapid Transport, Andrew Nice Omininikoron, over the alleged murder of his passenger, Oluwabamise Ayanwola. This is after the Lagos State Government arraigned the driver on four counts bordering on rape, conspiracy and murder of his passenger, Oluwabamise Ayanwola. The Lagos State Director of Public Prosecution DPP, Dr Jide Martins, also told Justice Sherifat Sonaike, that on November 25, 2021, the defendant allegedly raped a 29-year-old lady, Nneka Maryjane Ozezulu, without her consent. He said that the incident took place about 7 pm, at the Lekki- Ajah Conservation centre off the Lekki Ajah expressway in Lagos. The DPP also told the court that Andrew Nice conspired with others now at large and forcefully had sexual intercourse with his 22-year-old passenger, Oluwabamise Ayanwola, without her consent after which he murdered her. Dr Martins said the rape incident happened on February 25, 2022, at about 8 pm, on the Lekki-Ajah Conservation expressway. He said that the defendant and others still at large on February 26, 2022, unlawfully killed Oluwabamise Ayanwola by throwing her out of a moving bus at Carter bridge after having sexual intercourse with her without her consent. According to the prosecutor, the offences committed is contrary to and punishable under Sections 411, 223, 260 and 165 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015. When all the counts were read to the defendant, he pleaded not guilty to the charge against him.
