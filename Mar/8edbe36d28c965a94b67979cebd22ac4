A policeman attached to the Agbor Police Division has allegedly shot dead an iron excavator, identified only as Aminu, for reportedly refusing to pay a bribe of N1,000. The incident happened in the Ika South Local Government Area of Delta State. PUNCH Metro gathered that the trigger-happy cop allegedly demanded ‘daily dues’ from the deceased, who said he had not made any sales. Sources in the community told our correspondent that when the policeman pressed further, the late Aminu agreed to pay N500 twice, which infuriated the cop who allegedly brought out his gun and threatened to shoot the victim. “As the argument lasted, the policeman thought that Aminu did not want to pay the money, so he wanted to threaten him more. A gunshot followed and the man died on the spot,” the source added. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe, said he was not aware of the incident but promised to get back to our correspondent. He had yet to do so as of the time of filing this report. Meanwhile, members of the Arewa Progressive Forum, Ika chapter, staged a peaceful protest at the Agbor Police Area Command, Agbor-Obi, to demand justice for the victim, who was a member of the group.
