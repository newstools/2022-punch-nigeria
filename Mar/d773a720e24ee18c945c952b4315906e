The Minister for Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, has said that the Peoples Democratic Party, which he referred to as the “umbrella parish,” is not an option for Nigerians in the 2023 general election. Speaking on Channels TV’s Politics Today, on Friday, Fashola said that the PDP was the cause of the problems the country was currently facing and, therefore, could not be the solution. Fashola, highlighting the achievements of the All Progressives Congress-led government in the past seven years in the area of infrastructure, said it was totally wrong and embarrassing for the opposition to claim that infrastructure had no connection with the economy. The former governor of Lagos State stated that the APC government had transformed the narrative around the Second Niger Bridge from being a regular campaign promise to a reality. Asked about when the Lagos-Ibadan expressway would be completed and delivered, Fashola said, “by the end of this year, and I say that advisedly.” Fashola said that the APC is ready to take on the PDP in a debate, adding that “the umbrella is not an alternative to any problems of Nigeria.” Copyright PUNCH.
