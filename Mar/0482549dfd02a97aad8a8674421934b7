A statement by the Commander, National Agency for the Prohibition of Traffic in Persons and other related matters, Benin Zonal Command, Nduka Nwanwenne, said Edomwonyi, a housewife and mother of five, was arraigned before Justice Irele lfeje of the Edo State High Court, Benin City.

The defendant pleaded guilty to the offence. He said, “Mrs Edomwonyi, who is also known as Mama Gift, recruited a 14-year-old girl for her sister, Lovette, who resides in Burkina Faso. “On arrival in Burkina Faso, the victim was subjected to beatings, denial of food and slavery when she objected initially to engaging in prostitution. She was later sold to another lady, who forced her into prostitution, thereby losing her virginity. The traffickers collected all her earnings. “The victim was later rescued after the arrest of the convict, who was sentenced to a one-year jail term with an option of N300,000 fine.”  Copyright PUNCH.
