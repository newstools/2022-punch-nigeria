Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State has urged aspirants in the forthcoming general election to acquaint themselves with the new electoral Act. Okowa stated this on Monday while swearing in his Senior Political Adviser and three Special Advisers on Monday at Government House, Asaba. He noted that the Peoples’ Democratic Party had never been stronger, cohesive and more united than now and warned against acts that could undermine the new spirit in the party. The governor said, “I urge PDP members, especially the aspirants, to get properly acquainted with the new Electoral Act. Going forward, we are under obligation to ensure that our utterances, conduct, and actions are always guided by the provisions of the law. “As a party, the PDP at both the national and state levels has never been stronger, more cohesive and more united. As individuals or groups, we must shun anything that will undermine the new spirit in the PDP. “If we do this, I can say without any fear of contradiction that the PDP is poised to reign supreme from 2023. “As the final lap of this administration gathers momentum, we thought it necessary to bring in more experienced hands vast in their knowledge of the governance template, policy coordination, as well as conflict management and resolution.” Okowa said that if PDP faithfuls avoided acts that could cause distraction, the party would win massively in the 2023 general elections. The governor charged the appointees to discharge their responsibilities in accordance with section 196 (Sub-section 1) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
