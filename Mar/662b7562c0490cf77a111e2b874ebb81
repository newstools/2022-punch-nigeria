The All Progressives Congress, Anambra State chapter, has maintained that Emeka Ibe remained the recognised state chairman of the party. According to a statement made available to our correspondent in Awka on Monday, the state Publicity Secretary, Okelo Madukaife, said Ibe would remain the recognised chairman until the judicially restored tenure of the executives of the chapter was over in August 2022. Madukalife added that the clarification has become necessary in the light of a circulation on the Internet, suggesting that the State Deputy Chairman, Basil Ejidike, was “inaugurated” on March 7, 2022 in Abuja. The statement read in part, “If there is any truth to this, and, the action is inadvertent, we request that it should be denounced and repudiated. “If, however, it is actually a deliberate policy engineered by some elements in the National Secretariat to disobey the courts and foist an unknown leadership on Anambra State, for the goal of perpetrating some persons in office at the national level, it is hereby rejected in favour of sanity and the rule of law. “Members of APC in Anambra State are requested to maintain their characteristic cool with which they have won all battles against internal colonialism, yet put on their armour for the last lap of the battle. We shall be guided by our constitution and that of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
