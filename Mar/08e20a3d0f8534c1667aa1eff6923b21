The Director of Studies, Fescoat International School, Lagos, Felix Opata, has advocated the discovery and nurturing of sporting talents at younger ages. Opata, at the school’s 11th biennial inter-house sports on Friday, said the country would benefit from the discovery of sporting talents at younger ages. He lamented the impact of COVID-19 on sporting activities, saying the pandemic had thought shown that sports remained a unifying force. “The COVID-19 pandemic affected every aspect of the world including the world of sports. It was after the pandemic that the world really knew the importance of sport. Indeed, sport is a unifying force that dispels enmity, rancor and hostility. It brings the world together regardless of race, tribe and religion. The world began to heal when sport was gradually reintroduced, something everyone really and truly missed. “Our 11th biennial inter-house sports should have been held last year but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it did not come up. We thank God that the trying times are gradually passing away from the face of the world. “One appeal I want to make is that various stakeholders should not allow the talents that will be presented here to become wasted. The government should lay more emphasis on sports in schools and not just those that excel academically. The country will no doubt benefit from the discovery of sporting talents at younger ages,” Opata said. The Principal of the Secondary arm of the school, Fredrick Opata, urged the students to shun indiscipline, cheating and embrace the spirit of sportsmanship. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
