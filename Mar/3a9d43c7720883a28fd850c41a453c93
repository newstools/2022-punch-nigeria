Nollywood actress, Annie Idibia, has said that her children must have a mother that they can brag about. Annie had in a recent post online, reflected on her humble beginnings and in the process, commended herself for gracing the cover of a magazine. Expressing delight at the achievement, the actress said she once lived in “a one-bedroom ‘boys quarter’ with her three brother,” adding that she used “to watch coloured television in the next-door neighbour’s room because their mother couldn’t afford a coloured TV at the time.” She, however, explained that grace found her, adding that dreams do come true. The PUNCH made a report about the actress’s statement of living in a room with her three brothers. Reacting to the report on Tuesday, Annie said she was not ashamed of her humble beginnings. She, however, noted that though she was not from a rich family, her children must have a mother they would brag about. Annie’s post on Instagram read, “Aint no shame in humble beginnings!!! At least my kids n my entire generation won’t have to say this! Grace. I no bi rich man pikin! But kids must ve a mother they can brag about (sic).” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
