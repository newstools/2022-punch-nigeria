The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said that he has worked for the people of the state and fulfilled virtually all his campaign promises. He stated that “this is the time now we have to play politics of stomach infrastructure.” According to a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, Wike, who spoke at the inauguration of the Oro-Abali flyover, at the Kaduna Street Junction, along the Port Harcourt-Aba Expressway in Port Harcourt, said that he has secured the promised economic growth for the state. He stated that it is now time to start empowering those who have patiently worked with him. “Now that we have done virtually everything we have promised Rivers people, this is the time now we have to play politics of stomach infrastructure. “What people do not understand; people think when you are in government, from first day, you should be sharing money. I said, I won’t do that. “I have to work for the people of the State. Now that we have worked, the remaining period will be to feed your stomach,” Wike said. He challenged anyone to deny the developmental stride of his administration in the state. The governor noted that the time to empower people is now. “There is time for everything. Now, the time has come. We have to start to empower our people. The empowerment is for those who have been patient. “So, every local government, every community will have a pattern of how we are to empower our people. “As a government, when there is unemployment, some people bring out what they called welfare scheme to be able to cushion the level of poverty in the society. That is what we are going to apply here,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
