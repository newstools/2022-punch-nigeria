The United States’ second gentleman, Doug Emhoff, has tested positive for COVID-19, while his wife, Vice President Kamala Harris, tested negative, the White House said on Tuesday. Harris’ deputy Press Secretary, Sabrina Singh, said, “the Vice President tested negative for COVID-19 and will continue to test.” However, Emhoff, an attorney who is the first to hold the second gentleman title after his wife became the first woman ever to win the US vice presidency, tested positive. Harris had cancelled a planned appearance at a White House event celebrating Women’s History Month. President Joe Biden told the audience at the event that Harris “chose not to take a chance” and “out of an abundance of caution, she chose not to join us today. The President, however, said that Emhoff was fine. The news was the latest sign that the coronavirus continued to spread among some of the most carefully shielded members of the world elite. On Monday, the Greek Prime Minister, kyriakos Mitsotakis tested positive for COVID-19 and announced that he would be isolating and working from home. In his words, “the daily rapid test at the office gave a positive result to Covid-19. I will isolate at home and work from there. “I am certain all will be well and that I’ll be back at the office very soon.” AFP Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
