Six players have arrived at the Super Eagles training camp in Abuja ahead of Nigeria’s 2022 FIFA World Cup play-off tie against the Black Stars of Ghana. The players are William Troost-Ekong, Leon Balogun, Semi Ajayi, Ola Aina, Frank Onyeka, and Odion Ighalo. Technical Adviser Augustine Eguavoen had called up 24 players for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 play-off round against the Black Stars of Ghana. The PUNCH had reported that Eguavoen replaced injured Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi with Lorient midfielder, Innocent Bonke. Ndidi sustained a medial ligament injury against Rennes in the Europa Conference League on Thursday, with The Foxes manager Brendan Rodgers announcing after the game that the ever-reliable midfielder “will be out of action for a few weeks.” The injury will last between three to four weeks, which automatically ruled him out of the all-important games against The Black Stars. The injury had left fans worried as they await Eguavoen’s announcement on who replaced the former Genk player. Nigeria take on Ghana in the 20,000 –capacity Cape Coast Sports Stadium as from 7.30pm on Friday 25th March, with the reverse leg set for the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja on Tuesday, 29th March as from 6pm. The winner over two legs will earn one of Africa’s five tickets to the 22nd FIFA World Cup finals, scheduled for 14th November – 18th December this year in Qatar. “Update! Odion Ighalo don show. Update! 6 players in camp…William Troost-Ekong, Leon Balogun, Semi Ajayi, Ola Aina, Frank Onyeka, Odion Ighalo #SoarSuperEagles,” Super Eagles tweeted. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
