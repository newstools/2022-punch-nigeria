A non-profit organisation, Anap Foundation, has said a comedian, Mr Debo Adedayo (Mr Macaroni), has been appointed as one of the celebrities to sensitise youths to the 2023 electoral process. The group disclosed this in a statement in Lagos on Thursday, adding that Adedayo would work together with other GoNigeria activists such as Atedo Peterside (Convener), Aisha Yesufu, Folarin Falana (Falz) and Bishop Matthew Kukah, among others. The statement read, “Mr Debo Adedayo, actor, content creator and activist, who is popularly known by his stage name, Mr Macaroni, has joined other distinguished citizens and celebrities to become a GoNigeria Ambassador. “Macaroni, who is best known for his acting prowess and his engaging social media presence via comedy skits created by him, doubles as a conscientious activist in real life and would encourage youths to be actively involved in politics by picking up their permanent voters’ cards in preparation for the forthcoming 2023 elections.” Copyright PUNCH.
