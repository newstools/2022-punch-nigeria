Outrage has greeted the picture of the Taraba State chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Col Agbu Kefas and his predecessor, Victor Kona, which surfaced online on Monday. In the picture purportedly taken at the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja, Kefas was flanked by Kana who displayed his governorship nomination and expression of interest forms. Speaking to our correspondent in Jalingo, some party members, including Umar Gassol, Japhet Munga, and Veronica Danladi said the picture clearly showed that the party chairman and by extension the governor have endorsed Kona ahead of other aspirants. An aide to a governorship aspirant in the state said, “My boss and most guber aspirants viewed the picture as a ploy to discourage other aspirants from buying the form. “It was also alleged that the party chairman and Victor Bala also picked Senate nomination form for the governor which has not gone down well with us. “But we are not discouraged or intimidated by that move. Just watch out and see what is going to happen in the coming days. Oga is going to buy his form this week and so will other aspirants.” A lawmaker in the state also wondered why the PDP chairman would openly throw his weight behind an aspirant in a contest of such a magnitude. The lawmaker said, “We are in a democracy and the party chairman has a right as an individual to support anybody, but as a party chairman he has a moral burden to support all aspirants. “Is that how he will be accompanying all aspirants to the National Secretariat of our party in Abuja to buy their forms?” Copyright PUNCH.
