Justice Adepele Ojo on Wednesday said that prima facie case had been established against the Hilton Hotel owner, Dr. Ramon Adedoyin and six of his staffers arraigned in connection with the death of late Timothy Adegoke, a Master’s student at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. Adedoyin, and six of his staffers, Adedeji Adesola, Magdalene Chiefuna, Adeniyi Aderogba, Oluwale Lawrence, Oyetunde Kazeem, and Adebayo Kunle, had been arraigned on 11 counts bordering on conspiracy, murder, altering of receipt and administration of extrajudicial oath. Ruling on the no-case submission filed by the defendants, the Osun Chief Judge, said that, going by the evidence already before the court, the defendants have a case to answer regarding the death and called on them to enter their defense. She subsequently adjourned the matter till April 25 for the defense to open their case. Details later. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
