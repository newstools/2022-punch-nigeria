A presidential aspirant under the banner of the Social Democratic Party, Adewole Adebayo, has pledged to promote unity among Nigerians if given the mandate to rule the country. Adebayo made the promise while speaking to newsmen shortly after he addressed party supporters in Kano on Thursday. He said there was an urgent need to unite the country in view of the various divisive tendencies. “My first job if I am elected president is to unite the country because it does not need money or any budget to implement that one. “One also needs to be an inclusive person in order to lead this country. This will give me the opportunity to set up my cabinet within an hour because you’re interacting with Nigerians across the country,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
