The Registrar, Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, Prof Ishaq Oloyode, on Friday in Kano said the board had so far registered not fewer than 1.4 million candidates across the country for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination. He reminded candidates that there would be no extension of the March 26 deadline for the UTME registration. Oloyode said this while ascertaining the level of preparedness and facilities at the Kano zonal office of the board. According to the JAMB boss, the board will not succumb to any pressure to extend the UTME registration, pointing out that it had fulfilled all the requirements for a hitch-free registration of prospective candidates. ‘’My mission in Kano is to assess the level of registration. There is no crowd at the centres; the registration is going on smoothly, but the board is worried that towards the end of the exercise, people will be clamouring for an extension,” he stated. Oloyede noted that the National Identification Number was no longer a problem and called for the sensitisation of candidates. The registrar pointed out that so far, the board had registered 1.4 million candidates across the country. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
