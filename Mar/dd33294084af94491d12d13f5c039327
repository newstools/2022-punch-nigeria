Nigerian actor, Ugezu Jideofor, has posited that Nigeria was not working due to her “greedy and extremely clueless” leaders. In an Instagram post on Sunday night, the Nollywood star noted that the Nigerian authorities should concentrate on strengthening its administrative bureaucracy. Using the fuel scarcity bedevilling the country as an example, Jideofor noted that it was a shame for Nigeria to spend so much on refinery maintenance and still lack petrol products. He wrote, “If the authorities in Nigeria will tell themselves the truth, they will concentrate on strengthening our administrative bureaucracy and stay away from business. “Governments that work have no business in business. This government has reportedly spent $396M on maintaining refineries, and still we have no fuel. Shame! “Nigeria is not working because our leaders are greedy and extremely clueless.” He added, “Political lackeys should start defending their principals even when they know we are voicing the truth. I don’t even respond to lackeys. The grace to remain calm is intact.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
