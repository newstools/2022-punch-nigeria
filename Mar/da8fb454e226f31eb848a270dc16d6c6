AN indigenous oil marketer, OVH Energy Marketing Limited, has proffered recommendations for the development of the midstream and downstream oil and gas industry in Nigeria. It said the sector needed significant infrastructure investments. This was discussed at the just concluded 5th Nigeria International Energy Summit held in Abuja with the themed, “Revitalising the Industry: Future Fuels and Energy Transition.” The Chief Executive Officer, OVH Energy Marketing, an Oando licensee, Huub Stokman, called for more collaboration among relevant stakeholders in the industry to develop the necessary measures to improve infrastructural development in the sector. Stokman was quoted in a statement as saying, “On midstream and downstream infrastructural development, the industry needs more investment to expand and boost our jetties, pipelines, depots, trucks and human capacity development for safe operation. “We recognise that the industry needs more funding and investment to achieve all of these, whilst customers’ demands are met.” He further stated that the new Dangote refinery would change the supply landscape and would make Nigeria self-sufficient in the production of refined fuel. Stokman noted that if this happens, combined with a good competitive environment, customers could decide the best price served and who they would want to buy from. He, however, stated that a regulated market would slightly distort these elements. According to Stokman, new refineries would produce cleaner fuels, which would be good for the environment, and for the health of Nigerians.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
