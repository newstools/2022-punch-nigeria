Former Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, has indicated an interest in becoming Nigeria’s president in 2023. He made this known in a statement on Thursday, titled, ‘Fayose debunks endorsement’. Fayose, a two-term governor of Ekiti, said, “Report credited to me that I endorsed Peter Obi for President and zoning of the Presidency to the South-East is false. No doubt, I have great respect for Peter Obi as a leader and I respect his aspiration, but at no point did I endorse his presidential ambition or that the presidency be zoned to South-East. “Rather, my take is that the presidency be zoned to the Southern part of Nigeria. “May I also state clearly that I will be seeking the ticket of the PDP to contest the next presidential election.” Earlier, Fayose tweeted that he warned Nigerians against voting for the All Progressives Congress in 2015. He said, “Buhari’s sponsors and those who insulted me then should enjoy this while it lasts. Hopefully, we have all learnt our lessons about this FAKE CHANGE. “My voice was the loudest in 2015 against the inherent dangers of a Buhari’s Presidency. No one listened. Rather, I was attacked and insulted. Today, “Water dan pass Gari” as I am daily vindicated.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
