The Independent National Electoral Commission, on Monday, released the final list of candidates for the Ekiti State Governorship election. This followed the signing into Law of the 2022 Electoral Act by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). In a statement released on its website and signed by its National Commissioner and Chairman of Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, INEC said it released the list in compliance with the 2022 Electoral Act. “On Wednesday 16th February 2022, the Independent National Electoral Commission published the personal particulars and list of candidates (Form EC9) for the Ekiti State Governorship election in our State and Local Government offices as required by law. “In compliance with the Electoral Act 2022, the commission hereby publishes the final list of candidates for the election following the close of nominations by political parties,” the statement read in part. The commission reminded any political party that observes that the name of its candidate is missing from the list to notify the commission in writing, signed by its national secretary and chairman, and supported with an affidavit, not later than 90 days to the election, as provided for under Section 32(2) of the Electoral Act 2022. INEC also cited Section 32(2) of the Electoral Act 2022, which provides that failure to notify the commission “shall not be ground to invalidate the election.” See the list below:     Copyright PUNCH.
