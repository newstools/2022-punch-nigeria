Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, on Tuesday, urged the newly elected youth leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress to work hard and propagate the ideals of the party for a stronger and healthier party ahead of the 2023 general elections. He made the call when he received the newly elected Youth Leader, North West, Abdulhamid Muhammad, who was at the Governor’s Lodge, Asokoro, Abuja on Sunday, to thank the governor for his emergence as the youth leader for the zone. A day after, the governor also received the National Youth Leader, Abdullahi Israel and all other youth leaders from all the zones across the country. “Youth population is an integral part and a critical stakeholder for our national development. We always need them by our side to make our political and economic development more visible and sustainable,” he disclosed. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Abba Anwar, the governor emphasized that the elected youth leaders’ pedigree demonstrates how useful and relevant they could be to further strengthen youth inclusion in politics. With the new faces as youth leaders across all the six geo-political zones, Ganduje noted that the APC would continue to do more on youth inclusion in politics as well as national development.
