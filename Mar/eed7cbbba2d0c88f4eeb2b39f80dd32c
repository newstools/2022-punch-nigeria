THE Lagos State Government has said it would continue to work to reduce potholes in order to make roads in the state motorable. The General Manager, Lagos State Public Works Corporation, Lateef Somide, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday. Somide was quoted to have said this during the inspection of a rigid pavement operation carried out by the agency along LASU-Iba Road. He said, “At the moment, Lagos State Public Works Corporation is massively deploying its jet patchers with the aim of nipping emerging potholes in the bud before they degenerate to major defects that may call for more resources to fix. “If you look at Lagos roads, especially in the metropolis, majority of potholes and sectional failures have disappeared due to the round-the-clock approach of the corporation to maintaining the roads.’’ Somide added that the agency will collaborate with other ministries to improve the outlook of roads. “I am optimistic that the outlook of Lagos roads can only get better by the day due to the collaboration between the LSPWC, the Ministry of Transportation, the various Local Governments and Local Council Development Authorities, community development associations and all relevant government agencies,” he added.
