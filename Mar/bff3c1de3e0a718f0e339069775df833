Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State has announced the sack of his Honourary Special Adviser on Grassroots Mobilisation, Elder Enefiok Ekefre. Ekefre’s sack, which was conveyed in a letter signed by the Permanent Secretary, Government House, Dr Nathaniel Adiakpan, however, did not give reasons for the decision. “I am directed to inform you that with effect from March 1, 2022, your services will no longer be required. With this letter, your offer of appointment as Honorary Special Adviser, Grassroots, has been terminated,” the letter read in part. Ekefre’s termination of appointment comes barely two weeks after the Chief of Staff to the Governor and former Commissioner for Works and Fire Service, Mr Ephraim Inyang-yen, was axed. Our correspondent reports that Ekefre’s sack may not be unconnected to his open support for the governorship aspiration of one of the top contenders, Senator Bassey Akpan. Reacting to his sack in an interview with our correspondent in Uyo on Tuesday, Ekefre accused his former principal of running a “vulture-like leadership.” He stated, “You must have heard what I said before that there are two sets of leadership in Akwa Ibom State and the two sets are those of the hen and the vulture. “When the hen is scratching for food, it will push the crumbs back and its children will pick from there, but the vulture is the one that will take away everything and go to the top of a tree, and when it finishes, it comes back to pick another one. “I challenged Udom Emmanuel that outside his family, let him point out anybody, whether Ibibio, Annang or Oron, that he has empowered.”  Copyright PUNCH.
