THE Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Exchange Limited, Mr Temi Popoola, has said sound corporate governance will boost transparency and trust in the Nigerian capital market. He said this during the launch of the Corporate Governance Triangle, an initiative of the Nigerian Bar Association Section on Business Law, Nigerian Exchange Limited and the Institute of Directors, Nigeria. Speaking at the event, Popoola, who was represented by the Divisional Head, Capital Markets, Nigerian Exchange Limited, Jude Chiemeka, said, “As a securities exchange, we recognise our unique role in fostering the growth of long-term sustainable capital by positively influencing our key stakeholders to adopt sustainable business practices, including best practice corporate governance. “Sound corporate governance ultimately brings about greater transparency and trust in the Nigerian capital market and positions the market on a strong pedestal as a leading capital market in the region”. Popoola said NGX was pleased to collaborate with IoD Nigeria and NBA-SBL on the establishment of the Corporate Governance Triangle. “We look forward to working closely with our colleagues in these highly-reputed organisations to formulate and implement initiatives that will further raise the bar on corporate governance standards and practice in Nigeria,” he said.
