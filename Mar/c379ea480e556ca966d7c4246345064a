Striker Victor Osimhen says he is disappointed and left dumbfounded after the Super Eagles failed to book a ticket for the Qatar 2022 World Cup later this year. The Eagles needed a win against Ghana to qualify for the World Cup after playing a goalless draw at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi last Friday, but they could only manage a 1-1 draw, which saw the Black Stars qualify for the global football showpiece on the away goal rule. With score at 1-1, Osimhen thought he had given the Eagles the lead just before the half time, but his effort was ruled out by the Video Assistant Referee. “It was very disappointing; I don’t even know what to say. We all did our best but it was not enough on the day. It is sad because the next World Cup is years away and we have to sit this one out,” Osimhen told PUNCH Sports Extra. The 23-year-old Napoli striker, who was one of the few impressive Nigerian players on the pitch, added that he was delighted with the support of the fans. “I was impressed with the fans that came out; I have never seen that kind of support in Nigeria.” The disappointing result also led to fans invading the stadium and vandalising some sections of the field as well as destroying the glass in the technical area.
