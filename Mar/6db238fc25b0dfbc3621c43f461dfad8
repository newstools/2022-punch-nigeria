He wished himself a happy birthday and hoped to share his dreams and enjoy what the year has for him. Mokeme wrote, “Hello 50, I’ve waited a long time for this day. Nice to finally meet you. “You don’t look anything like they say though. You look like 30, the one I met 20 years ago. Or is 50 the new 30? Of course, that’s the GRACE factor. “Anyways let’s pop some bubbly, fill up our flutes and make a toast. We have some catching up to do, then I can share my dreams with you. I’m glad you could make it, so let’s start with Happy Birthday to me. “You know the drill. We’re gonna have fun and enjoy our moments.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
