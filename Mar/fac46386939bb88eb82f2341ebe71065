Ghanaian actor, John Dumelo, has vowed to walk barefoot from his nation’s capital, Accra to Lagos, if the Super Eagles of Nigeria beat the Black Stars on Friday. The Super Eagles and Black Stars are set to play at the Baba Yara Stadium the first leg of their World Cup qualifiers. The second leg will be played at the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja on Tuesday. On his Instagram page, Dumelo said, “There’s no way Nigeria will win today’s match. If they do, I, John Setor Dumelo, will walk barefoot from Accra to Lagos tomorrow morning with my ginger on my head. Super Eagles my foot.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
