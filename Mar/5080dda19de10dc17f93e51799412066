The Nigerian Global Affairs Council has petitioned the Federal Government, asking it to sentence to death by hanging without the option of fine, anyone found guilty by a court for ritual killings. In their petition on change.org, the group suggested that an Anti-Ritual Activities Bill be put in place to curb the spate of the killings which it said, had made women endangered species. “Ritual activities that include the administrator (babalawo or herbalist) of such ritual killings, the accomplice to such ritual killings, and the beneficiary of such ritual killings will be sentenced to immediate death by hanging without with an option for an appeal if their murderous crime of ritual killings is proved beyond every reasonable doubt. “Anyone found to publicly display ritualistic activities whether on and off social media, including within or outside the confines of their abode, will be arrested and tried according to the tenets of this law and that of the Federal Republic of Nigeria; if found and proven guilty beyond every reasonable doubt, they will be sentenced to jail for between 15-50 years without an option of appeal. “This bill will seek to make life, safety and environmental awareness training compulsory for all children of school age, including adults – It means that nursery, primary, secondary, and tertiary institutions must partner with a life, safety and environmental awareness company to offer training and simulation exercises that help reduce and prevent these scenarios of needless deaths as seen in recent times.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
