PayedIn Technology and McHenrich Technologies say they have entered a partnership that combines PayedIn’s ‘no code payment’ technology with Mchenrich’s marketing expertise to deliver hassle-free payment services to merchants. The firms said in a statement that with digital inclusion and participation in the digital economy being a global agenda, the Central Bank of Nigeria’s policy in the last few years had been geared towards encouraging cashless transactions. It said, ‘PayedIn technology and McHenrich Technology have come together to provide an industry leading no code, no hassle payment solution to all merchants. “To start benefiting, all a merchant needs to do is signup by providing basic details to start receiving payments. Merchants can sign up and receive their first payment within minutes.” The statement said the solution would revolutionise merchant payment and accelerate the country towards a cashless reality. Despite the CBN’s digital economy policy drives, it added, most transactions in Nigeria are still cash-based because the bottom 80 per cent of merchants who carry out the most transactions are still largely digitally excluded. The Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, PayedIn, Debo Shopade, said, “As a technology company, we are increasing our reach and focused on expanding into new segments where our technology is addressing key pain points while addressing the globally relevant issue of digital inclusion. “Today PayedIn becomes a key partner with McHenrich with a mission to speed up the adoption of our easy-to-use payment services in a key customer segment.”  Copyright PUNCH.
