U-17 World Cup winner Kingsley Udoh has recounted his experience playing against Ghana at the dreaded Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi during the qualifiers for the 2011 African Games. Udoh was a member of the U-23 team coached by Austin Eguavoen that took on Ghana for a place at the 2011 African Games and crashed out after the tie ended 3-3 on aggregate. The first leg in Benin City ended 3-1 in favour of Nigeria but the Black Meteors, as Ghana’s U-23 side are known, won the tie 2-0 to qualify on the away-goal rule. Eleven years after, Udoh, who won the U-17 World Cup in 2007, said the players had a nightmarish time playing against their archrivals in Kumasi. The former Heartland centre-back said hostile fans made the players pass through hell before, during and after the encounter. “We were not allowed to enter the dressing room,” Udoh told PUNCH Sports Extra. “They poured excreta and juju inside our dressing room and we couldn’t go in. We changed outside. They destabilised us, Kumasi fans are very harsh and unfriendly and it’s same city coach Austin Eguavoen is going back to. “It’s not a place you’ll like to play, the forces there are too much but I believe we have players who can withstand the heat there.”
