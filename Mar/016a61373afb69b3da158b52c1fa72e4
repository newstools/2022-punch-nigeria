A former media aide to the Rivers State Governor and civil rights activist, Opunabo Inko-Tariah and a member of the State House of Assembly, Martins Amaehule, have disagreed over the citing of flyover projects in the state. While Inko-Tariah accused his former boss of neglecting other tribes by concentrating the construction of flyovers in Port Harcourt and Obio/Akpor Local Government Areas alone, Amaehule said the flyovers were constructed where they were most needed. Inko-Tariah alleged that Governor Nyesom Wike was enriching himself in the guise of constructing flyovers, wondering why 12 flyovers would be constructed in two of the 23 LGA’s of the state. He stated, “The question is, are you going to construct just a road in other local governments and Obio/Akpor and Phalga alone you have 12 flyovers? “This is a governor that is not interested in the welfare of Rivers people. He is only interested in the construction of flyovers so that he would be able to line or feather his pocket.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
