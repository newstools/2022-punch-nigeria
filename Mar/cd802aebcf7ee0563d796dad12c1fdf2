THE former spokesman for the Atiku Abubakar Campaign Organisation in 2019, Segun Showunmi, has declared his interest in the governorship race in Ogun State on the platform of the   Peoples Democratic Party in 2023. Showunmi made the declaration on Wednesday during a stakeholders meeting held in Abeokuta. He described himself as the people’s choice, blaming  the  failure of the PDP to win the governorship elections in the past  to the infighting in the party. He urged all members of the party to jettison their personal interest and work for the progress of the party. He said, “All our efforts have not produced any result for some time and the main reason is the unnecessary infighting. “All you have said concerning Segun Sowunmi to come and run for governor, I have heard and I heard clearly. I will definitely, most definitely and extremely definitely run for the governorship of Ogun State in 2023. “I have spent the last 20 years or more in this political dispensation serving them, speaking for them, improving them, running for them and I have now realised that I am the leader they  have been searching for and I tell you again with every sense of responsibility that you have never seen governance at the level I intend to do it.”  Copyright PUNCH.
