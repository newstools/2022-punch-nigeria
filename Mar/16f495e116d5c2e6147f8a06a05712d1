A Yaba Magistrates’ Court in Lagos State has remanded a Bus Rapid Transit driver, Mr Nice (Andrew) Omininikoron, for 30 days. Omininikoron was arrested in connection with the murder of a passenger, Oluwabamise Ayankole. Magistrate O.A. Salawu held that Ominnikoron was remanded pending legal advice from the Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecution. The defendant is charged with conspiracy, murder, rape and misconduct with regards to corpses. The charge was read to the defendant but his plea was, however, not taken by the court. Salawu adjourned the case until April 11 for DPP advice. Earlier, the Officer in charge of the Legal Department at the State Criminal Investigation Department Panti, Mrs Yetunde Cardoso, said that Ominnikoron committed the offence at 8 p.m. on February 26, along Ajah-Oshodi Expressway, on a Lagos State BRT bus with code number 257. She said that Ominnikoron, who was on duty as a driver, raped Ayanwole, and pushed her out of the moving BRT bus. The offence, she said, contravened the provisions of sections 411, 223, 260 and 165 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). Sections 223 stipulates death penalty for the offence of murder, 260 provides for life imprisonment for rape and 165 carries five years imprisonment for misconduct with regards to corpses.
