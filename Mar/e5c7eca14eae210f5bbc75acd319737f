A few hours after his statement that power should rotate to either Ukwa axis of Abia South or Abia North, the former Senate President, Sen. Adolphus Wabara, has been removed as the Chairman, Governing Council of Abia State University, Uturu. In a late evening Press release by the Secretary to Abia State Government, Barr. Chris Ezem, the state’s Governor, Okezie Victor Ikpeazu, and visitor to Abia State University, Uturu, approved the dissolution of the Governing Council of the University with immediate effect. The governor immediately approved the reconstitution of the Governing council as fellows; Chief Mba Okoronkwo Ukariwo – Chairman, Chief Obinna Njoku – member, Senator Emma Nwaka – member, Chief Chinwe Nwanganga – member, Chief Ndukwe U Ndukwe – member, Dr. Jonas Ibeaja – member, Barr. C Nwokeukwu (SAN) – member and Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education – member. Earlier in the day, Wabara, who is also the Secretary, Board of Trustees of the Peoples Democratic Party, had warned the state government and the party that they will lose Abia if another Ngwa man tries to succeed Ikpeazu. Wabara had warned that any attempt to make another Ngwa man succeed Ikpeazu who is also an Ngwa man would be counterproductive for PDP, while the party might get a protest vote in Abia, come 2023.
