An award-winning society journalist, Bolaji Olasunkanmi, is set to unveil his first book titled, My Lens, My Odyssey: Times, People and Events (Vol: 1). In a statement sent to Sunday Scoop, Olasunkanmi stated that his motivating factor for writing the book was to document some of his notable experiences. He said, “As a journalist, I often go through my materials from time to time and the idea to document them into a book for posterity crossed my mind in 2020. “I then assembled a team last year (2021) and began to codify all my materials. The book is my small contribution as a journalist to showcase my experience on the field over the years. I am optimistic that people will find it a good read.” Speaking on what to expect from the book, Olasunkanmi likened it to a walk through his journalistic career, capturing activities of captains of industries, entertainers, scholars, and entrepreneurs; albeit in a light mood. Some of the encounters dwelt on in the book were with esteemed personalities such as President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN), former President Olusegun Obasanjo, the late Ernest Shonekan, Chief Rasaq Okoya and wife, Shade; General Theophilus Danjuma (retd.) and wife, Senator Daisy; Bola Tinubu and wife, Senator Oluremi; Senator Florence Ita-Giwa, Funke Akindele-Bello, Aliko Dangote, Femi Otedola, Evander Holyfield and Thierry Henry.
