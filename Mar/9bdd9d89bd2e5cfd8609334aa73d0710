The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, said, on Friday, that Moscow was ready to search for solutions amid negotiations with Ukraine. Putin made this known as he spoke with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the telephone, the AFP reports. He, however, accused Ukrainian authorities of stalling talks by putting forward unrealistic proposals. “It was noted that the Kyiv regime is trying in every possible way to stall negotiations, putting forward more and more unrealistic proposals,” the Kremlin said after the phone call. “Nevertheless, the Russian side is ready to continue to search for solutions in line with its well-known principled approaches.” (AFP)
