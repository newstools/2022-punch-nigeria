Residents of Taiwo Adewunmi/Imafidon Crescent at Oko Oba GRA Scheme 1, in the Ifako-Ijaiye Local Government Area of Lagos State have appealed to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to see to the completion of the 977m road that has been abandoned since 2019. The construction project, which was reportedly awarded to Reviera Resources Limited in 2018 and works commenced in December 2019, was expected to be completed within nine months. However, three years later, the road is yet to be completed. The development has brought untold hardship to residents of the area. While staging a protest last week, the residents carried placards bearing messages such as “Nine months have turned to three years,”; “Mr. Governor, Rescue Us,”; “We are in pain, help us,”; “Save us from impending flood,”; “Lagos State Government do the needful,”; and “Nine months pregnancy, three years in labour.” In an interview, the Chairman, Oko Oba GRA Scheme 1, Ayobade Obajimi, said the construction was expected to last for nine months. However, he said it was unfortunate that the project has now been prolonged beyond the projected timeline without considerable commitment on the part of the government to see to its completion. He said, “We had written letters to the Office of the Governor, Deputy Governor, Special Adviser on Works and Infrastructure, and the Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly. What we need from them is to prevail on Riviera Resources to come and complete the road before the rain starts.” Asked what effort was made after the letter had been written, he responded, “We are following up to ensure the letters get to the right quarters.
