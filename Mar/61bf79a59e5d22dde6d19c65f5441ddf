Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State on Tuesday lifted the ban on operations of Tricycles, Motorcycles, and Tipper in Nkanu East, Nkanu West, and some communities in Enugu South Local Government Areas. Ugwuanyi had on Friday after an emergency security meeting with chairmen and major stakeholders in five local government areas in Enugu East senatorial zone, signed Executive Order No 1. 2020 banning operations of tipper lorries, tricycles, and motorcycles in three local government areas. The decision, however, did not go down well as some leaders in the state including the Spiritual Director, Adoration Ministry Enugu, Rev Fr Ejike Mbaka have condemned the ban on the basis of its effect on the masses. Following the condemnations that trailed the ban, Ugwuanyi invited the union leaders of the Association of Tricycle Riders Transport Union, Motorcycle Transport Union in Enugu state, Nkanu East/West branches, and the Enugu State Tipper Union of Nigeria, to a meeting at the government house on Tuesday. Arising from the meeting, the governor bowed to the pressure and lifted the ban. Senior Special Assistant to the governor on Media, Louis Amoke, in a statement shortly after meeting, said that governor Ugwuanyi has lifted the ban. He explained that the Union leaders admitted that hoodlums have infiltrated their associations to perpetrate criminal activities to tarnish their image and tendered unreserved apologies to the governor. According to him, they pledged to fish out the bad eggs among them and support the efforts of the security agencies to curb crimes in the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
