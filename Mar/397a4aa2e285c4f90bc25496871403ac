The mother of the late musician, Oladipupo Owomoyela, popularly known as Dr Orlando Owoh, Madam Christiana, passed away after a brief illness that lasted for some days. According to a member of her family, Eniolorunda James, she passed on at the age of 120 in her hometown, Owo, Ondo State. James also stated that the centenarian died few days after falling sick. He said, “It is true mama has died. She was sick for just a week before giving up the ghost.” He added that the family would make an announcement in due course. In an earlier interview with The PUNCH, Madam Owo had stated that she had lost the urge to live. She had said, “I am done with life and I want to exit at this stage. I think I am done with life. The only thing I want now is for God to take me away. I don’t have friends anymore. Most of my friends are dead while those who are still alive can no longer do anything freely like the way I still walk around.” Orlando Owo passed away on November 4, 2008. The late singer initially worked as a carpenter until 1958, when he was hired by the Kola Ogunmola Theatre Group to play drums and sing. After some time, he formed the ‘Dr Orlando Owoh and his Omimah Band’ in 1960, and over a musical career of 40 years, he became one of the leading proponents of highlife music. He had over 45 albums to his credit. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
