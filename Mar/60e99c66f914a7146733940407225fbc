Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar on Wednesday in Abuja declared his intention to contest the Peoples Democratic Party presidential ticket ahead of the 2023 general elections. Speaking at the International Conference Centre, Abuja, the presidential hopeful said, “The most fundamental right of every Nigerian is the right to life. But the All Progressives Congress has failed to protect the life of our citizens. Under my Presidency, I will not tolerate insecurity. “They said we should go back to farms. How can Nigerians return to the farms when you have not secured the farms? “When the APC came in 2015, they met a debt profile of N12tn. But now, we have more than N32tn in debt. Under my watch, I will reduce borrowing.” He added that his administration would focus on five priority areas: unity, security, economy, education and devolving more powers to the federating units. He continued, “Nigeria is in dire need of visionary leadership. Presently, Nigeria is a sinking ship that must be urgently rescued. That is why I am announcing my candidacy for the Presidency. “I offer myself to rescue the ship. Under my captainship, this ship will sail to brighter days by the grace of God. This is a journey I will take with all Nigerians. “Under my Presidency, I will focus on five key areas; unity, security, economy, education and devolving more powers to the federating units. I am the unifier that is coming to bind the broken union. Under my Presidency, there will be a new Nigeria where everybody has an equal voice and is heard.” In his address, the Adamawa State Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, said an Atiku Presidency will unite and secure the country, salvage the economy and create jobs for Nigerians. He said, “Atiku Abubakar represents a special treasure to Nigeria. His commitment, his unity, his growth and development of Nigeria is a sign of his patriotic aspiration. He is probably the most experienced person in the race at the moment, not only in our party, the PDP, but also in the country.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
