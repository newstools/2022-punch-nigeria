Nigerian artiste, Tolulope Ajayi, aka T-Classic, has expressed anger after one of his music fans tagged him a struggling artiste during a live broadcast on Instagram. During the live broadcast, T-Classic was seen rebuking the statement as he revealed that he once battled depression. He, however, noted that popular artiste, Pual Okoye, aka Mr P, was part of the people that came to his rescue, adding that despite running his music without support, he was still progressing in the music industry. T-Classic said, “I am not calming down. I was depressed, if not because of Mr P, I was going through depression and everything just to make everybody alright and everything dey nice, you con dey come here dey call me struggling artiste. “Are you mad? The world never see this kind of T-Classic before, because I dey do my things for low key, I no dey like to bother nobody for no f**king thing, I dey do my things my way. I dey a lot of peoples dms wey be say dem no dey help, na me dey run my p myself.” T-Classic’s outburst was taking another dimension when a member of his team cautioned him. “I know say I dey live; make I clear these people, why you go dey call me struggling artiste?” he said. The live broadcast, however, ended abruptly as his team member intervened. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
