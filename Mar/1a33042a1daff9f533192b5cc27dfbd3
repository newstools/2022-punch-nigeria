Nigeria International, Chidera Ejuke, and former international, Victor Moses, may suspend their contracts with Russian sides CSKA Moscow and Spartak Moscow as FIFA on Monday allowed foreign players and coaches based in Russia to quit their clubs for the rest of the season. Ejuke, Moses and Nizhny Novgorod forward, Sylvester Igbonu, are the Nigerians currently plying their trade in Russia, who have been sanctioned from the sporting world after their invasion of neighbouring Ukraine on February 24. According to FIFA, players and coaches can suspend their contracts with their Russian and Ukraine clubs till the end of the season. The players and coaches have also been given the go-ahead to join other clubs outside both countries until June 30. Clubs in other countries will be allowed to sign up to two players who had been at clubs in Russia or Ukraine outside of the normal transfer window periods. Victor Moses was in action for the entire duration of Spartak’s 2-0 win over Dynamo Moscow on Sunday, while Ejuke was a substitute in CSKA Moscow’s 1-0 win over Novgorod, with Igbonu an unused substitute for the latter. The Russian league has not been suspended, but players who feel unsafe in the country have been given the go-ahead to leave. However, Ukraine’s league has been suspended since Russia’s invasion of the country, with players allowed to temporarily leave until June 30. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
