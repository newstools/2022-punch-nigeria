Delta DSZ 912 XA. On sighting the police team, the robbers reportedly shot at the police and zoomed off. But the patrol team chased the robbers to MacCaiver Market and engaged them in a gun duel, our correspondent gathered. However, on getting got to the market, the police were said to have ceased fire due to the crowd while the robbers jumped out of their vehicle and ran into the crowd.
