The National Centre for Disease Control has partnered the Nasarawa State Government to commence testing of Lassa fever at the State Infectious Diseases and Research Diagnostic Centre. Speaking on Thursday at an award ceremony for outstanding staff members of the Dalhatu Araf Specialist Hospital, Lafia, the hospital’s Chief Medical Director, Hassan Ikrama, said the partnership would save lives and help patients reduce the cost of travelling a long distance before getting tested for Lassa fever. He said, “The state government has entered into partnership with NCDC to begin collection of blood and testing for Lassa fever at the state research centre. “The reason for the partnership is to have a centre that can take samples and run Lassa fever tests. It would reduce the cost of travelling a long distance and save the lives of the patients.” Ikrama added that the Japan Development Agency, through the NCDC, had visited the state research centre which is currently running COVID-19 tests to ensure that the centre can effectively start testing for Lassa fever.
