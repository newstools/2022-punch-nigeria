Nigerian legendary singer, Innocent ‘2Baba’ Idibia, and his actress wife, Annie, renewed their marital vows to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary. Annie revealed this in an Instagram post on Friday, as she promised to share videos and pictures of the “very intimate” ceremony. She also asked her fans not to judge her, adding that vulnerability was not a form of weakness. Annie wrote, “Yes fam, a guy (2Baba) and I renewed our vows. 10 years anniversary! “It was very intimate but we wanted to also share it with the whole world. I’ll post pics and videos. “Enjoy the show, but don’t judge me too much.” The mother-of-two added, “Vulnerability isn’t weakness! I wanna believe that it is being brave. It is ‘strength’.” This comes shortly after videos emerged, where Annie recounted how hurt she felt when she realised that 2Baba had children with two other women when he dated her first. Featuring in a new reality TV show, ‘Young, Rich and African’, which premiered on Thursday, Annie stated that her first child was 2Baba’s fifth, adding that she faced so much embarrassment. In September last year, Annie had a social media ‘war’ with the Idibias as she accused her husband of spending time with his baby mama when he travelled abroad. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
