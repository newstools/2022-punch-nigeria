Following the orders of the Provincial Governor of Instabul, Ali Yerlikaya, schools, universities and other facilities have been shut until Monday over heavy snow that gripped the city. Schools in towns on the Black Sea and in parts of eastern and western Turkey also remained closed for the time being. Many parts of Turkey had also cancelled classes as the snowfall had reportedly paralysed parts of transport and public life in Turkey. On Friday, the airline’s Pegasus and Turkish Airlines had cancelled several hundred connections from the two airports in Istanbul, and more were pre-emptively scrapped for Saturday. On Friday morning, there was a thick blanket of snow on the roofs of Istanbul’s houses and people were trudging through grey slush in the central Taksim Square. On Thursday, passage through the Bosporus strait had already been banned because of the weather conditions. NAN
