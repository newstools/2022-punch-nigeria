Friends, family and fans of legendary juju musician, Ebenezer Obey, are presently putting finishing touches to their plans to host him to a remarkable 80th birthday celebration on Sunday, April 3, 2022. Merrymakers gathered that the celebration will serve as an opportunity to honour the veteran musician for his positive impact in the entertainment industry over the past six decades; transcending from preaching morals to promoting culture and tradition as well as developmental ideologies. According to the birthday celebration committee, the leadership and members of Decross Gospel Mission will host Obey, who is also the General Overseer of the church, family, and dignitaries from all walks of life in a thanksgiving service on April 3, at the church’s headquarters in Agege, Lagos. A grand reception will also be held on April 8, at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, in Abeokuta, Ogun State. Organisers of the Headies Awards have also concluded plans to celebrate the music icon with an event on May 22 at Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos. The event will feature a cross section of artistes who are excited to honour the music icon. This is even as a biography on Obey will be launched at the event.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
