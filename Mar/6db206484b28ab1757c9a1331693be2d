The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, while debunking the idea of contesting for presidency in 2023, asked supporters to give him money rather than the presidency. Recall that The PUNCH reported that a group, Amaechi Vanguard in the United States of America/Canada, urged the All Progressives Congress to choose Amaechi as the party’s consensus presidential candidate for 2023. In the same light, Governor Nasir El-Rufai also said that he would only run for the 2023 presidency, either as a presidential aspirant or as a running mate with Amaechi, if President Muhammadu Buhari insisted. Amaechi, who reacted to these developments, said he only needed money to survive and not the presidential seat. Speaking on Arise TV, he said: “The people that want me to run for the presidency in 2023 should just give me the money. I need money to survive.” However, reports had it that Amaechi’s presidential campaign posters had been seen severally at the Eagle Square in Abuja, where the National Convention of the All Progressive Congress was held. Some other posters were sighted, including that of the former Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, and that of the Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi. Copyright PUNCH.
