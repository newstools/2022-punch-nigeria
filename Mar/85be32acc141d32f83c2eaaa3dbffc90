The Management of Guinness Nigeria Plc. has declared that the company has no plans of leaving Nigeria, contrary to grapevines touted on social media. The Corporate Communications Manager, Guinness Nigeria Plc., Mrs Ayodele Alabi, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Thursday in Lagos. Alabi noted that the company’s both offices in Nigeria and Ghana were still verily operational, saying it would be foolhardy and counterproductive to shut down operations therein, further dispelling any ill notion of relinquishment. Guiness Managing Director, Mr Baker Magunda, also disowned such inglorious tale as unfounded and in contrast to the company’s die-hard commitment to branching out and dutifully serving its ever-nourishing consumers and stakeholders particularly across the African continent. He said that the company’s financial performance for half year of 2021 showed its operating profits grew by 266 per cent to N13.6 billion. “We urge our employees, stakeholders and members of the public to ignore this false, malicious and misleading publication as it never emanated from our management. “Guinness Nigeria has confidence in the Nigerian economy and just as we have done for the past seventy one years, we would remain a major player in the country by continually investing, developing capabilities, and growing brands that most suit the consumers’ needs, and contributing positively to lives, communities and the environment,” he assured.
