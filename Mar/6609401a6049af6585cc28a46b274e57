The Lagos State Government has said it would review the policy on wetlands management as part of efforts to restore and preserve degraded wetlands in the state. The Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday. Bello, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Office of Environmental Services in the ministry, Mr Mobolaji Gaji, was quoted to have said this during an advocacy programme on wetlands and biodiversity conservation for Lagos Central Senatorial District held at Yaba. He said, “The state government has commenced the identification of all wetlands within the five divisions in Lagos State and is planning to review the draft policy on wetlands management and conservation of its biodiversity (2016) with a view to restore, protect and conserve degraded wetlands in Lagos State for better use. “The advocacy programme themed ‘We are part of the solution #ForNature,’ is part of efforts aimed at creating awareness on the importance of preserving wetlands and maintaining a healthy ecosystem. It is the responsibility of everybody in the state to ensure proper soil management and fight biodiversity loss.” Bello added that wetlands provide numerous benefits and there is an urgent need to reverse the degradation of the ecosystem. “The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021 to 2030 stated the fundamental and urgent need for the restoration of ecosystem to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by preventing, halting and reversing the degradation of ecosystems worldwide through advocacy/sensitisation programmes,” he said.
