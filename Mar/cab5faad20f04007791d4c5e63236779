A shoemaker, Sikiru Owolabi, has been arrested for allegedly killing a 48-year-old man, Bolanle Adilewa, in the Ijo Mimo area of Akure, the Ondo State capital. PUNCH Metro gathered that the suspect and the victim had an argument on Tuesday, which degenerated into a fight. Owolabi was said to have stabbed the victim to death. Our correspondent learnt that the deceased was the son of the suspect’s landlord. A source said Owolabi rented a shop in the victim’s father’s house, where he plied his trade. The source said, “As they were fighting, the shoemaker took a broken bottle and stabbed him (Adinlewa). He gave up the ghost on the way to a hospital.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, Funmilayo Odunlami, confirmed the incident. She noted that while the alleged killer was already in police custody, the matter had been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department for further investigation. Odunlami said, “The suspect is in our custody. He said he acted in self-defence when the deceased took an object to attack him while they were fighting.
