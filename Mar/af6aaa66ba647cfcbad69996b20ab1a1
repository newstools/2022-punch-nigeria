Benue State Governor and Chairman of the PDP Zoning Committee, Samuel Ortom, Tuesday in Abuja reaffirmed the committee’s commitment to producing a zoning formula that reflects the diversity in the party. Speaking at the 37-man committee’s second meeting Ortom also revealed that its mandate has been extended to April 5 as it is far from achieving its goal. So far, seven aspirants have purchased the presidential nomination and expression of interest forms to compete for the PDP presidential ticket. With aspirants drawn from various zones of the country, the PDP is under increased pressure to zone its national offices in a way that does not put the party at risk of fragmentation. Ortom said, “The meeting is yet to be concluded. We have adjourned till Tuesday next week at the same time, at the same venue. And until we conclude the proceedings, there is not much to say. So far, all the members are quite understanding. There wasn’t any form of tension. “All the members understand ourselves that zoning is very key and we are looking at it that at the end of it all, we will do something that everybody will accept and we will go ahead as one big family and win the 2023 elections.” Copyright PUNCH.
