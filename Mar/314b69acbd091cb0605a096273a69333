The Chairman, Mutual Benefits Assurance Plc, Dr Akin Ogunbiyi, has urged youths in the country to take leadership positions. Ogunbiyi spoke during an interview shortly after he was inducted into the Marketing Edge ‘Hall of Fame’ at the premier edition of the award night organised by Marketing Edge. Some other successful individuals who had distinguished themselves in their chosen careers were also honoured. Ogunbiyi urged the youths to support those who have integrity and have made positive impacts because they are the future of the country. “Leadership in this country is for the youths, and if the youths should step up their game and give all the necessary support, I think the future is bright for Nigeria,” he said. While noting that the youths occupy almost half of Nigeria’s population, he said the difference cannot be made by staying away from leadership matters. Ogunbiyi said, “If you look at the youths of our country, they account for about half of the population. They are complaining about challenges in the country, but one thing is that if you step up, you can actually achieve a lot. “Look at the EndSARS that took place, it was spontaneous across the country. That shows that youths have the capacity if they want to do it, but then, they need to organise themselves.” The Chief Executive Officer, Marketing Edge Group, John Ajayi, said it was imperative to celebrate leaders in the business of brand building and management who had earned their respect in their chosen fields. He said it introduced the recognition to promote the ‘idea of brands’. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
