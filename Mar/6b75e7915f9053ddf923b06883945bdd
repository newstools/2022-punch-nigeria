The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr Godwin Emefiele, has said he will support the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) to finish strong. Emefiele disclosed this in a series of tweets on Monday, as he responded to rumours of his purported presidential bid in 2023, stating that he was focused on strengthening the country’s economy. He tweeted, “My focus at this time is a robust monetary policy and fighting inflation, which is now a global problem; building a strong financial system in an increasingly uncertain global economy; development finance and supporting farmers and manufacturers in our self-sufficiency and import substitution drive; raising N15tn for InfraCo infrastructure financing; building a world class international financial centre in Lagos; as we support the Muhammadu Buhari administration to finish strong.” Several groups and individuals have called on Emefiele to contest in the 2023 election. The peak of the demand was at the Eagles Square convention ground of the All Progressives Congress in Abuja on Saturday when hundreds of youths across the country stormed the venue in the CBN governor’s branded apparels.
