Ghana have been handed a huge boost in the goalkeeping position ahead of their Qatar 2022 World Cup play-offs against Nigeria with the return of Orlando Pirates goalkeeper, Richard Ofori, from injury. The Ghana assistant captain had been plagued by injury, which saw him miss out of the country’s participation at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations finals in Cameroon in January. The 28-year-old last featured for Pirates in the DSTV Premiership August 2021 but returned to action in the side’s 3-0 win over Eswatini side Royal Leopards Simunye in the CAF Confederation Cup on Sunday. Pirates have however confirmed that the shot stopper has been invited for the game against Nigeria with the team coach Mandla  Ncikazi praising him for his qualities. “Ofori is a top professional, Ghana selected him without playing a game. I was surprised.” Ncikazi told the South Africa media. “You could just see the confidence he brings and breathes around the defence and I’m sure he is going to lessen the leaking of goals at Pirates because more than the fact that we are not scoring, we are also letting in goals and I’m sure it’s going to improve,” He added. Ofori had been Ghana’s No.1 before injury and has been capped 25 times by the Black Stars since making his debut on October 18, 2015. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
