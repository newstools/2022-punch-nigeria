Flourish Sebastine scored a hat-trick to hand Falconets a 3-1 win over hosts Senegal in their Costa Rica U-20 World Cup qualifiers on Saturday in Thies. With the victory, the two-time World Cup silver medallists have all but assured themselves of a spot at this year’s U-20 Women’s World Cup finals after their sterling performance. Sebastine, who plays her club football for Edo Queens, hit a hat-trick in the encounter at the Stade Lat-Dior and left no questions about the Falconets’ enthusiasm and determination to fly Africa’s flag in Costa Rica in five months’ time. The nimble-footed forward started the carnage as early as the 9th minute, and then hit two quick goals in the second half as Senegal, who reached this stage after penalty shoot-out defeat of Mali in the fourth round, fell totally apart. Togolese referee Vincenta Amedome offered the hosts a consolation goal from the spot in the 89th minute, after captain Oluwatosin Demehin had tripped a Senegalese forward in the Nigerian box. The Falconets produced a masterclass performance with silky touches, good positioning, on-field aptitude and proficiency. The return leg will take place at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, Benin City on Saturday March 26. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
