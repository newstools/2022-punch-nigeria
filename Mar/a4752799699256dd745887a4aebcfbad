Kebbi State Government has started fumigating strategic areas against bird flu (Avian Influenza) which was reported in some parts of the state. Commissioner for Animal Health, Husbandry and Fisheries, Alhaji Aminu Dandiga, told newsmen in Binrin Kebbi on Friday that the fumigation was part of measures to contain the spread of the virus. “Recently, we received a report of bird flu in two farms, in two local government areas of the state. “We deployed our medical teams; they went round and took samples and they tested positive. “Government consequently decided to fumigate all the 21 local government areas in the state. “Health workers were engaged and trained on how to handle virus and communities have also been sensitised,’’ he said. Dandiga enjoined residents not to panic as necessary measures had been put in place to ensure the containment of the virus. In his remarks, Dr. Ahmed Muhammad-Aliyu, the state’s Epidemiology and Disease Reporting Officer in the ministry, explained that the infected birds had the virus in their saliva, mucous, and faeces. “Human infections can happen when the virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled. “People with close or prolonged unprotected contact with infected birds or virus contaminated environments may be at greater risk. “Illnesses in humans from the virus have ranged from mild eye and respiratory tract infection to severe illness like pneumonia that can result in death,’’ he said. Muhammad-Aliyu called on the general public to report any suspicious bird flu to the ministry. (NAN)
