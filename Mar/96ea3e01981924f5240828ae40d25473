AN aspirant for the national chairmanship of the All Progressive Congress and Chairman, Senate Services Committee, Senator Sani Musa, has congratulated Niger State Governor, Sani Bello, on his appointment as the acting Chairman of the party’s Caretaker/ Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee for the conduct of the national convention. Musa, while on a visit to the governor in Abuja, expressed his support and wished him a successful assignment. During a closed-door meeting, Musa and Bello deliberated on salient issues bordering on ways to reposition the party by ensuring that the APC remained a strong, progressive and a united political party working in synergy and with the support of its government at all levels ahead of its March 26 national convention and the 2023 general elections. Musa expressed his desire to bring a new beginning to the APC leadership that would re-engineer the internal structures and workings of the party. He solicited Bello’s support on his aspiration to become the national chairman of the APC, but maintained that his ambition was not a do-or-die affair, but to reposition the party to a political institution that would groom leaders and win elections, stating that he would abide by any decision taken in the interest of the party.
