Yoruba rights activist, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, has begun a fresh negotiation with the Benin Republic government over his health status. Counsel for the detained activist, Chief Yomi Aliyyu, made this known on Thursday. He explained that Igboho is negotiating to be moved to another detention facility over his health status. According to Aliyyu, reports that Igboho has fled to Germany is not also true. In a statement titled, ‘Re: Purported release of Sunday Igboho’,  the lawyer said, “Kindly discountenance any news about the release of Chief Sunday Adeyemo or that he is on his way to Germany. It is not true, please. “With the assistance of a worldwide renowned professor and prof Akintoye and lawyers (Falola and myself), we are negotiating for something more comfortable for him than prison to meet his health demand. “I advise you to remain calm and prayerful.” Aliyyu earlier announced that previous negotiations to get Igboho freed didn’t yield the desired result. Instead, he said Benin Republic renewed Ignoho’s incarceration despite that there was no criminal charge against him and no extradition request from the Nigerian Government. Igboho, who escaped from a deadly raid on his Ibadan residence by the operatives of the Department of State Service on July 1, 2021, was arrested in Benin Republic on his way to Germany on July 19 together with his wife, Ropo. His wife was released by Igboho and has been in detention since then and if the extension of his incarceration is allowed to stay, he may spend at least one year in detention in the country.
