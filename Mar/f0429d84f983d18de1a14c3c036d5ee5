The Managing Director, Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority, Prof. Adesoji Adesugba, has reiterated the Federal Government commitment toward ensuring eligible Nigerians are gainfully employed across the country. Part of measures put in place to achieve this, Adesugba said, was the creation of 43 Free Trade Zones across the nation. He added that the trade zones would create employment opportunities and reduce youth restiveness in Nigeria, thereby ensuring the younger generations contribute meaningful to nation building. Adesugba gave the assurance while speaking in Lagos during the breakfast forum tagged, “Non-Oil Exports: Situation Report and Way Forward” organised by the Nigerian-American Chamber of Commerce. “The free trade zone as well as special economic zones provide the panacea to reinvigorate the non-oil sector in the face of dwindling and unstable revenue from oil, rising demand from foreign exchange, insecurity, external debt, etc,” Adesugba who was represented by an Assistant Director in the agency, Mr Augustine Onyekwelu, said According to him, in these trying times of youth restiveness, the free trade zone is a veritable tool to tackle the problem of unemployment in addition to improving exports of non-oil products. On her part, President of the Chamber, Dame Adebola Williams, raised concerns on the over-dependence on crude oil exports by Nigeria. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
