THE Lagos State Government has honoured the Councillor representing Ward B at the Agboyi-Ketu Legislative Council, Oluwatoyin Odegbesan, for her contribution to the development of the state. According to a statement on Thursday, Odegbesan received the Lagos State Government’s Women Achievement Recognition Award for Agboyi-Ketu Local Council Development Area during the International Women’s Day event at Onikan. She said, “The award is dedicated to the hospitable women of Agboyi-Ketu LCDA, without prejudice to creed, calling or political leanings. Aside from the borehole project to provide safe and clean water to my constituents, I undertook many people-oriented projects since assuming office. This is unbelievable, because when I started my political journey, I never believed I could become a councillor, but ‘human proposes, God disposes.’ “As a reward to God for his grace upon me, I have vowed to use my office as a fulcrum to inspire humanity and I am thankful to my husband who gave me the space to participate in politics.” The Executive Chairman of Agboyi-Ketu LCDA, Dele Oshinowo, urged other women in the LCDA to work towards the progress of humanity.
