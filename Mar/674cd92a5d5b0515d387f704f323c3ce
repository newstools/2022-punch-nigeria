The Plateau State House of Assembly led by Yakubu Sanda on Tuesday declared the seat of the lawmaker representing Jos East State constituency, Abok Ayuba, vacant. Abok, the embattled former speaker of the State Assembly had been at loggerhead with the Sanda-led leadership since October last year when he was removed in controversial circumstances. The crisis in the House had led to the vandalization of the state assembly and the lawmakers had since relocated to the Old Government House at Rayfield, but Ayuba had refused to attend any plenary called by Sanda. The matter is presently before the state high court. Last Saturday, Abok decamped from the All Progressives Congress to the Peoples Democratic Party. His Media Assistant, Itse Kaze, in a statement on March 18 said Abok officially tendered his letter of resignation from the APC while presenting a letter of intent seeking to return to his former party, the PDP at the party’s Jos East Local Government Secretariat at Angware. The decision to declare his seat vacant came on the heel of a letter from the state chapter of the APC urging the speaker to declare Abok’s seat vacant following his defection which the party said was contrary to section 109 (1) of the  Nigerian Constitution.
