The United Nations Children’s Fund has revealed that it will donate $500,000 towards the implementation of Primary health care in Borno and Yobe states. This was as the agency also handed over essential medicines worth US$438,972 to both states for the improvement of maternal and neonatal health. This was contained in a statement on Wednesday titled, ‘UNICEF supports maternal, neonatal and child health in Borno and Yobe States’. The statement read, “UNICEF has handed over essential medicines worth US$438,972 to the governments of Yobe and Borno States, as part of efforts to improve maternal, neonatal and child survival and health outcomes in conflict-affected communities in north-east Nigeria. “UNICEF will also support the implementation of the Primary Health Care Memorandum of Understanding it signed with the States with an additional US$ 500,000.” The statement noted that women and children were most affected by conflict in North East Nigeria. In 2020, each day of conflict claimed the lives of 170 children from direct and indirect causes, and reduced access to health services, the statement revealed. “We are laying the foundation for optimum wellbeing for thousands of children born and yet to be born,” said Phuong Nguyen, UNICEF Chief of Maiduguri Field Office. Nguyen added, “With this intervention, pregnant women in Yobe and Borno States will be able to access primary healthcare facilities in their communities and receive essential drugs, tests and basic medical support in primary healthcare facilities close to their homes.” Copyright PUNCH.
