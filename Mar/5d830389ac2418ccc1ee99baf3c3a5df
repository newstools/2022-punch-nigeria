Music producer, John Udomboso, aka Young Jonn, has said there is guaranteed formula for making a hit song. Some of the songs produced by the beat maker include Olamide’s Story for the Gods, Kizz Daniels’ Mama, Flavour’s Lose Guard and Davido’s Biggest Backside. In an interview with Sunday Scoop, he said, “There is no particular formula for making a hit song. One just has to let it flow. One should understand the working conditions suitable for one and let it flow. No pressure.” Young John also maintained that the days of good music are not gone. He said, “I don’t think the days of good music are gone. As a matter of fact, I think we have better songs now, and it is slowly evolving to become much better. The African music scene keeps getting bigger and better.” The beat maker also stated that he has been able to stay relevant because he is never satisfied. He said, “I believe what has kept me relevant is never being satisfied. I always want to do more. Most importantly, God has been good to me, because it is not just one’s effort that counts. I feel blessed.” The producer also noted that he is currently working on a new body of work titled, Love is Not Enough Vol 1. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
