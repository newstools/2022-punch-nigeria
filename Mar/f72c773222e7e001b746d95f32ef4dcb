The National President, All Nigeria Youths Reoriented Initiative, Mr Olufemi Oguntoyinbo, has urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to release the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu. Oguntoyinbo, who is also a presidential aspirant in the 2023 election, said this in an open letter made available to our correspondent on Sunday. He said, “The purpose of this open letter is to, most respectfully, seek your indulgence and appeal to your fatherly conscience, to use your good office and ensure the release of the IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu. We are not saying that he is innocent of the allegations against him. We are pleading that, as a father on one hand, and as a leader working for the best intentions for the country, you temper justice with mercy. “We are all mere mortals, and it is given that we will offend one another; but even as we expect the forgiveness of God for our wrongs, we are here pleading that, concerning Nnamdi Kanu, one of your sons, that you temper justice with mercy. It will show that our president considers the emotions of his children, and all his people, and has risen to answer their call for the release of the IPOB leader. “If God the creator forgives His children, who offend him, including all of us, then we should also learn to forgive others when they offend us. When you wholeheartedly forgive someone who has offended you, you win him over totally. “But if you fight back, you have shown that there is no difference between the two of you. Personally, I am sure that Kanu and indeed all other people have learnt their lessons from this very case.”
