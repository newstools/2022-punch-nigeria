A Magistrate’s Court sitting in Ilorin, Kwara State, has remanded two brothers, Abdullateef and Yusuf Adekanye, in a custodial centre for allegedly exhuming their father’s corpse for ritual. The police arraigned the two brothers on Wednesday on two counts of criminal conspiracy and exhuming of a corpse. The offences, according to the prosecution, are contrary to and punishable under sections 97 and 226 of the Penal Code Law. The prosecutor, Moshood Adebayo, said the duo led some people now at large to their family compound and removed the remains of their late father, Zakarya Adekanye, from the grave without the knowledge of other family members. Adebayo further alleged that the defendants desecrated the burial ground located at the Agba Akin Court, Offa, where their father was interred in 2012 according to Islamic rites. He told the court that the defendants exhumed and packed all the skeletons away for ritual purposes, which contravened the law of the land. The brothers, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The prosecution prayed the court to remand them in custody pending the determination of the case. The Magistrate, Mohammed Adams, granted the prosecutor’s application and ordered the defendants remanded in a custodial centre. The case was adjourned till April 12, 2022, for further hearing.
