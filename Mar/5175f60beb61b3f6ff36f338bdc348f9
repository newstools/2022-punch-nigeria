The Founder, Olukismet Humanitarian Foundation, Mr Olumide Adegboye, has canvassed support to put the physically challenged persons in a good perspective with a view to bringing out their potentials. Adegboye, who cautioned against neglecting the physically challenged or writing them off in view of their condition, said, “There is ability in disability. We should see it as our duty to help bring out the best in these people.” Adegboye who was represented by the group’s Strategies Coordinator, Haruna Moses, spoke at Ikere Ekiti during a ‘Medical outreach for the physically challenged and empowerment programme for the aged.’ He said, “The physically-challenged people have been largely marginalised. There is a large percentage of such marginalisation in Nigeria. Our idea as a non-governmental organisation is to bring out these categories of people, give them support and help them to be able to move around so that they can pursue one economic activity or the other. “In addition, we are educating them on how to make a livelihood, how to earn a living without dependence on others and we are empowering them. This is drawn out of love for humanity,” he said. Adegboye who said the group would extend the medical outreach to some patients at the Federal Teaching Hospital, Ido Ekiti, Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital and School for the Physically Challenged, said the Foundation had been reaching out to the downtrodden in society across the six geo-political zones of the country.
