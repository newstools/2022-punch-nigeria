The National Publicity Secretary of the People’s Democratic Party, Debo Ologunagba has described the All Progressive Congress as a “special purpose vehicle” hurriedly put together to defraud Nigerians. Ologunagba in a chat with journalists in Lokoja on Saturday said that the performance of APC in the past six years has revealed the party was a party that had nothing to offer Nigerians. “The level of poverty unleashed on Nigerians in the past six years is unprecedented in the history of Nigeria, and our people are tired and have unequivocally resolved to show them the way out in 2023. According to him, “the result of the recent bye-election has clearly pointed to the fact that Nigerians have unanimously rejected APC, and the PDP is well-positioned to take over and restore decency into governance in the country come 2023.” “You can see for yourself the level of insecurity the country has been thrown into, PDP is coming in 2023 to right all the wrongs APC has thrown at us as a Nation.” Reacting, the state Chairman of the APC, Alhaji Abdullahi Bello, described the PDP as an assemblage of ungodly people who deserved no response from any serious quarter. He said, “PDP had the opportunity for sixteen years to put things right but squandered and destroyed everything including themselves. What moral justification does the party has to talk about a party through which God has used President Muhamadu Buhari to reposition the country towards greatness”.  Copyright PUNCH.
