The Kogi State Police Command has arrested three suspects in connection with the killing of a Deeper Life pastor. The PUNCH had reported that Pastor Alimi Victor of the Deeper Life Bible Church in the Okehi Local Government Area was abducted and allegedly hacked to death on March 10 after church service. He was said to be on his way home from the church service at the Okaito area along the Kabba-Okene road in Kogi when he was abducted and hacked to death by suspected assailants. The state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Williams Aya, said that the body of the cleric was found inside a pit along the route of his church, a few days after he was declared missing. He added that the command went after the suspects, adding that intelligence led to the arrest of three suspects.
