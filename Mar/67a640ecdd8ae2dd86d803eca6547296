Sunshine Stars coach, Deji Ayeni, has praised his team’s spirit in their 2-1 comeback win over visiting Dakkada FC at the Dipo Dina Stadium, Ijebu Ode. The Owena Whales endured a terrible start after Emmanuel Charles gave Dakkada the lead in the second minute. However, Bello Babatunde restored parity, scoring a free-kick in the 14th minute before Ikenna Cooper poked home the winner in the 75th minute. Delighted by the fight-back, Ayeni heaped praises on the players for not giving up despite conceding an early goal. “It is normal when a team is doing well and there is a breakage, it is always tough when the team wants to pick up again. So, don’t take anything away from these boys because they were really disorganised by the early goal,” he told www.npfl.ng. “The boys were very anxious and wanted to get back to winning ways. So, I told them to cool down. The timing of the equaliser was key. We knew the second half was going to be a ding-dong affair and we had to be very tactically disciplined. At the end of it all, I think it paid off after we mounted high pressure on them,” he added.  All rights reserved.
