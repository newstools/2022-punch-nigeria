The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps has arrested 19 suspected vandals and impounded seven trucks and two tankers in Delta State. The agency’s Public Relations Officer in the state, Emeka Peters, in a statement on Sunday in Asaba, said the operation was in line with the core mandate of the NSCDC to protect lives and property. He said, “The Delta State Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Akinsanya Iskilu Abiodun, paraded the 19 suspects, two tankers and seven trucks. “Two of the suspects, Odiaka Divine, 22, and Monday Bakwana, 28, were arrested by the tactical squad of the Anti-Vandal Unit in Patani LGA of Delta State on March 9, 2022, while conveying petroleum products suspected to be illegally refined DPK (kerosine) in polythene sacks inside a Mercedes 817 mini truck. “Also paraded were 17 suspects, two tankers and seven trucks loaded with illegally refined petroleum products suspected to be AGO (diesel). The suspects were arrested in Ozoro, Isoko North LGA of Delta State by the Commandant General’s Special Intelligence Squad in less than 48 hours on arrival in the state.” Abiodun said after investigation, all the suspects would be charged to court to serve as a deterrent to others.
