ADEMOLA Adeleke Campaign Organisation on Monday alleged that there is a plot by some defeated political forces to malign its principal through sharing of fake video clips. The organisation, in a statement reacting to a viral video of a man dancing, also said its principal was not the man engaging in lewd dance in the clip. A statement made available in Osogbo by the group also threatened to take legal action against those spreading fake news about Adeleke. The group said there was no time that Adeleke was involved in such dance, describing the clip as a failed attempt by some elements to paint him in a bad light. The statement read, “We, therefore, alert the general public of a grand plot by defeated political forces to malign the flag bearer of the PDP in Osun forthcoming governorship election. We are in possession of details of plans to share fake videos and clips purportedly of Senator Adeleke. We urge the public to ignore this false propaganda designed to undermine our principal. “Those behind the plot are scared of the increasing popularity of Senator Adeleke. They conducted pre-election surveys that confirmed that Adeleke is unstoppable in July, hence the resort to blackmail and malicious disinformation and maligning activities.” Copyright PUNCH.
