No fewer than eight persons have been reportedly killed during another phase of the supremacy battle between Eiye and Aiye confraternities in Sagamu, Ogun State. The fresh killings occurred on Sunday, a few days after seven persons were killed in different parts of Abeokuta, the state capital. Our correspondent gathered that 15 persons had been killed in less than two weeks in Abeokuta and Sagamu. The clash between the rival cults got to its peak following the gruesome murder of a lout popularly known as Tommy in Oluwo, Abeokuta. Our correspondent learnt that as of Sunday evening, residents in Panseke, Onikolobo, Oluwo and Adigbe fled for their lives as gunshots rent the air. Though the police said 18 persons were arrested, calm seemed not to have returned as the crisis escalated to Sagamu, Remo axis of Ogun State. As early as 7am on Sunday, sources said some young men stormed some places in Sagamu and killed their targets. A source said the bodies of the victims were picked up by the police; others were said to have been taken away by their parents. According to the source, an electrician, identified only as Akeem, was killed in the Ajegunle area of Sagamu. “Akeem did not die immediately; but when they were rushing him to a hospital, another motorcycle hit them and he fell. That was how he died eventually. His intestines were coming out because he was shot in the stomach,” he added. It was also gathered that some of the victims were murdered in Soyindo, Ijagba, Ajegunle and Sabo, all in Sagamu. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, promised to find out and revert. He had yet to do so as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH.
