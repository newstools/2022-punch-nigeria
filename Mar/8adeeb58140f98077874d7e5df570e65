A former Chairman of the Project Development Agency, Enugu, Mr Daniel Onjeh, has dragged the National Assembly and the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), before a Federal High Court in Abuja over Section 84 (10) of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2022. In the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/300/2022 and filed on March 10, 2022, Onjeh is seeking an order of the court to strike out a section of the Act, which he said was inconsistent with the nation’s constitution. The section restricts political appointees at any level from voting or being voted for at parties’ congresses or conventions. Onjeh is asking the court to determine whether Section 84 (10) of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2022 is not inconsistent with the provisions of sections 40, 42, 65 (1), 106, 131, 177, and 187 of the Constitution and whether to the extent of the inconsistency, the said section is “not unconstitutional, invalid and liable to be struck down.” The court document read, “If the questions are answered in the affirmative, the plaintiff seeks the following reliefs: “A declaration that the provision of Section 84 (10) of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2022 to the extent of its inconsistent with the provisions of sections 40, 42, 65 (1), 106, 131, 177, and 187 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 as amended. “An order of this honourable court striking down the provisions of Section 84 (10) of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2022 on the grounds that it is inconsistent with the provisions of  sections 40, 42, 65 (1), 106, 131, 177, and 187 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 as amended.” In a supporting affidavit, Onjeh, said he was a member of the ruling All Progressives Congress and he was the party’s candidate for the Benue South Senatorial District in 2014, a position he said he would still contest in 2023. He argued that the disputed section of the Electoral Act restricted and limited his aspiration and right to be appointed as a political appointee and also to seek election into elective offices. He added, “That by the said Section 84 (10) of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2022, my right to vote and be voted for at my party’s primaries and convention is restricted/curtailed if I’m given a political appointment by Mr President in future. “That I know as a fact that the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria does not impose this peculiar and strange restrictions as done by Section 84 (10) of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2022 on citizens’ right to participate in political parties’ activities like convention and party primaries. “That if Section 84 (10) of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2022 as presently stands is allowed to stay, so many Nigerian citizens currently holding political appointments and those who are eligible to hold political appointments will have their right to participate in political associations/parties’ activities like party congresses and conventions and their right to seek elective office restricted and totally curtailed.”  Copyright PUNCH.
