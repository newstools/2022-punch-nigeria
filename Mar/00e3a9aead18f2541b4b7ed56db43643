The Plateau State Police Command on Saturday said it had restored normalcy in Mangun and neighbouring communities following the tension that trailed the killing of two suspected kidnappers in the Mangu Local Government Area of the state. There had been palpable fear in the affected communities when some suspected kidnappers stormed the community and kidnapped a trader’s son. One of the villagers said to have been mobilised to rescue the victim was said to have been shot dead by the suspected kidnappers. Angered by the development, an irate mob was said to have lynched two of the suspects who were caught during the chase. The situation was later said to have degenerated into a crisis when the villagers discovered that one of the lynched suspects was Fulani. Sources said the mob began to set some houses suspected to be owned by Fulani on fire, leading to a clash and a breakdown of order in the area. Three persons were said to have sustained injuries and were taken to the hospital. But the Police Public Relations Officer, Ubah Ogah, said the quick intervention of security agents saved the situation. Ogaba said, “We have restored normalcy in the affected communities. We have also initiated and engaged the communities on the need to live in peace. We hope they will continue to sustain the peace while an investigation continues.”  Copyright PUNCH.
