The Nigeria Football Federation has described as “shocking” the death of Emmanuel Sunny Ojeagbase, the Chairman of Complete Communications Limited, who passed on at the weekend in the United States of America. President of the NFF and FIFA Council Member, Mr Amaju Pinnick, stated that the departed “oracle and legend” of sports writing and sports publishing carved a bold niche for himself in the profession. Pinnick made this known in a press statement on Tuesday titled, ‘NFF mourns passing of sports journalism titan, Sunny Ojeagbase’, by the federation’s spokesman, Ademola Olajire. He said, “Anyone in the line of football, nay sports knew Pastor Sunny Ojeagbase. He was the authentic legend of sports writing and sports publishing and even went into other terrains that people thought was not possible. We are shocked by his death at this time because he still had so much to give. However, God loves him much more and he has taken him at the appointed time. “Our joy is that he lived a full, fruitful and fulfilled life. On behalf of the Nigeria Football family, we pray that Almighty God will grant him eternal rest and also grant the family he has left behind, as well as the Complete Communications family, the fortitude to bear this great loss.” Copyright PUNCH.
