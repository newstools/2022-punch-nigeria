Financial experts have said the Nigerian economy will experience increased activities in 2022. They spoke during the fourth edition of Coronation Merchant Bank’s interactive session series with the theme, ‘Nigeria’s economic landscape – a blend of optimism and uncertainty. Delivering her macroeconomic presentation, the Chief Economist, Coronation Merchant Bank, Chinwe Egwim, said, “Looking ahead, on the back of specific factors we expect upward pressure on prices. “Overall, consumption patterns are relatively better and are almost mirroring pre-pandemic levels. However, we must note that consumer pockets are still steadily being rebuilt.” Advisory Partner/Chief Economist at PwC Nigeria, Dr. Andrew Nevin, expressed his optimism for 2022. He said, “We have a bigger economy and more economic activities than we think. “The official number from NBS is about N20tn in the fourth quarter which understates the economy perhaps as much as 25 per cent. We also have a smaller population than estimated, so we are actually richer than we think.” The Founder and Chief Consultant, Adedipe Associates, Dr. Biodun Adedipe, said, “We’ve seen the pattern in the last 10 years of non-oil sectors accounting for between 77 per cent and 82 per cent in terms of contribution to our GDP, while the oil sector has repeatedly accounted for less than 10 per cent.
