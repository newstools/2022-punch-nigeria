One of the 40 students evacuated from Ukraine over the ongoing way in the country, Uzaifa Halilu Modachi, is dead. His death came barely two weeks after he was evacuated to Sokoto State from Ukraine. The student’s death was announced by his father, Habibu Modachi, who is a serving member of the Sokoto State House of Assembly. It was learnt that the late Modachi has since been buried in Sokoto State. According to his father, the late Uzaifa was in Ukraine for three years without returning home for vacation. The father said, “Alhamdu Lilah, God gives and take away life, and that’s how he wanted it to happen, there is no doubt about it. “Had it been he died in Ukraine so many things would be said about him, that he was either killed by the Russian bombardment or had an accident or even accidentally shot and killed by the Ukrainian Army. “We are grateful to God for having him die before us, we also thank the Nigerian government particularly Sokoto state for taking a hasty decision to evacuate them before the full escalation of the War in Ukraine.” The late Uzaifa was said to be preparing for his final-year examination at the Zaporizhzhia State Medical University in Ukraine before his death. The examination is expected to qualify him to be a medical doctor. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
