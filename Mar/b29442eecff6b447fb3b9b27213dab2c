Osun State Government has consoled Nigerians and the government of Kaduna State over the attack on Abuja-Kaduna passenger train in the Katari area of Kaduna state. A statement signed by the state’s Commissioner for Information, Funke Egbemode, on Tuesday, described the attack as abominable. The government also said that the nation had again suffered human and material losses, adding that lives had been cut short in their prime by the “rampaging army of the heartless.” The statement further read in parts, “On behalf of the Governor of Osun State, Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola, the Government and the people of the State, we express our heartfelt sympathy to the families of the victims, the Federal Government, the government and people of Kaduna state and indeed, all Nigerians over this unfortunate incidence. “This latest attack, by every measure, is abominable. The nation has again suffered human and material losses. Lives have been cut short in their prime by these rampaging army of the heartless. We are however encouraged by the collective resolve of government at every level to stop these workers of iniquity in their tracks, to put an end to the narrative of bloodletting, sorrows, and severe pains that these evildoers have brought upon the country. “Kaduna State, and indeed, Nigeria, are assured of the support of the government and good people of Osun at this difficult time. Our prayer is that God grants the families of the victims of this tragedy the fortitude to bear the irreparable losses while we pray for quick recovery of all those who sustained various forms of injuries.” Copyright PUNCH.
