The Ijaw Youths Council has called for an investigation on the planned invasion of some riverine communities in Edo by some persons. The council’s Secretary, Western Zone, Omaghomi OluDerimon, made the call in a press conference in Benin on Sunday. OluDerimon alleged that the plan invasion was posted on the Facebook wall of an individual. He said, “We hereby call on the Inspector-General of Police, Commissioner of Police and other security agencies, the governments of Delta and Edo States to look into this matter. We demand a security investigation on it. “One of them has boasted that he has mobilised thugs and youths to carry out this planned invasion of Inikorogha, Gelegele and Olodioma. “He has been a Facebook bully, insulting the good people of Ijaw communities for no just reason. He also goes about insulting those with political ambition in the area. “He had claimed that I, OluDerimon, and some other persons, had on Thursday laid ambush on him and his cohort. It is funny that that same day and about the same period, we were locked in an IYC meeting on issues bordering on Okomu among others.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
