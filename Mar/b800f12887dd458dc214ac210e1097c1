Following the lingering fuel scarcity across the nation, the Plateau Command of the Federal Fire Service has warned residents of the state to desist from storing petroleum products in their homes. Mr Anzolo Epaphras, the Public Relations Officer of the command, gave the warning in a statement in Jos on Friday. According to him, fuel, diesel, kerosene and other petroleum products are highly inflammable, hence residents should avoid storing them in their homes. “It has come to the notice of the Federal Fire Service that some residents in Jos are making a habit of storing petroleum products at home. “We strongly advise members of the public to desist from such, irrespective of the current fuel situation. “These products are highly flammable and storing them at home multiplies the risk of a fire outbreak. “This fire threat goes beyond the immediate occupants of the building to neighbouring buildings as petroleum-based fires spread rapidly and wildly,” he said. Epaphras also advised residents to have exit routes in their houses and install fire extinguishers in their homes. He urged residents to call the command on 07061777747 in the event of emergency for prompt response. (NAN)
