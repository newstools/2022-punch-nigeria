The United States Consulate General Lagos has said it will empower women to create sustainable businesses through the Academy for Women Entrepreneurs programme. The Deputy Public Affairs Officer, US Consulate, Lagos, Jennifer Foltz, disclosed this in a statement on Monday. Foltz was quoted to have said this during the intended co-operation agreement signing in Lagos with the Group Head of Venture Garden Foundation, Tesilimi Yusuf, and the President of Ascend Studios Foundation, Inya Lawal, to equip 250 Nigerian women with practical business skills. She said, “The United States Government is committed to supporting women’s full and free participation in the Nigerian economy as they seek to thrive in the workforce, succeed as entrepreneurs, and create stability and prosperity in their communities. “Collaboration between the US Consulate General Lagos, Venture Garden Foundation and Ascend Studios Foundation will support the implementation of the 2022 Academy for Women Entrepreneurs, a US government programme that advances women’s economic empowerment and entrepreneurship in Nigeria. “The Venture Garden Foundation team will bring a wealth of expertise and knowledge to the AWE programme in Nigeria and we are confident that their contributions to and engagement with the AWE participants will result in improved leadership, public speaking, time management, self-confidence and financing options.” Yusuf explained the importance of helping women to fully participate in and contribute to the local and global economy.
