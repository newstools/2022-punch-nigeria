As part of the universal call for coordinated activity at the global, regional, national, and local levels, the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency in partnership with the Nigeria Solidarity Support Fund is championing campaigns in vaccine confidence and the vaccination of 70 per cent of the population. Vaccine confidence, according to the Centre for Disease and Control, is the belief that vaccines work, are safe and are part of a trustworthy medical system. As this is an urgent public health issue with research, development, and communications around quality vaccines on the rise, the NPHCDA and NSSF held a virtual roundtable discussion tagged ‘Vaccine Confidence in Nigeria’, recently. The vice-chairman, NSSF, Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, at the event, said, “This roundtable discussion puts us in right place, at the right time to accelerate the exchange of ideas and scaling-up of good practices to reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.” At the virtual roundtable discussion, the Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer, NPHCDA, Dr Faisal Shuaib, said no fewer than 1.6 million Nigerians had been vaccinated in the six-state vaccination drive championed by the NSSF and NPHCDA. The Director of Disease Control and Immunisation at NPHCDA, Dr Bassey Okposen, harped on the significance of going to the grassroots and providing information around why vaccines work.
