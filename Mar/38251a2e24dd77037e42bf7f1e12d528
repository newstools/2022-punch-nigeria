Osun State Government has said National Youth Service Corps’ members would no longer be posted to its Ministry, Department and Agencies. The directive was contained in a circular signed by S.A Aina on behalf of the government, which observed that MDAs have been engaging corps members without serious assignment for them. The circular further stated that needless engagement of corps members had resulted in an increase in monthly figures of corps members with an attendant increase in the monthly wage bill. “Worst still, the irrelevance of the disciplines of the majority of these corp members to such MDAs make them redundant for a better part of their service year. “Arising from the above, and in line with the circular from the Ministry of Finance Ref. No. 143/1 dated 31st January, 2022, it is now imperative to note that regulatory measure on engagement and deployment of corps members is still in force. “It is equally mandatory for all MDAS in dire need of corps members to complement their Staff in critical areas to henceforth channel such requests, prior to their mobilisation at NYSC Camp, through the Ministry of Youth and Sports, justifying and indicating areas of specialisation and the number required. Any MDA that violates this directive will not have such corps members payrolled. “It is also to be noted that, henceforth, corps members are no longer to be posted to government MDAs but Schools so as to fully engage them and reduce the tendency of redundancy and truancy among them,” the circular partly read.
