Big Brother Naija star, Tega Dominic, has revealed that her marriage ended in 2020, before she went on the show. The former BBNaija housemate was caught on camera with fellow housemate, Boma, in what many believed to be sexual acts, despite being married. After she was evicted from the house, Tega apologised and said she took responsibility for her actions in the Big Brother house with a housemate of the opposite sex. However, The PUNCH reported that Tega later denied the allegations that she had sex with Boma, stating that they were only acting out a script. Since then, there have been questions about her marriage. Tega, on Friday, disclosed that her marriage ended before the show on Instagram while she fielded questions from her fans after an unnamed fan asked her to stop shrouding her marital status. In response, Tega wrote, “Lol, I am not. Ended since; all you know was a move that went wrong. Actually ended in 2020. Now you all can get off my backs.” (sic)  The doubts about Tega’s marriage had risen again after she alleged that her husband cheated on her by bringing his lover to their home. The PUNCH reported that in an interview with media personality, Chude Jideonwo, on his show, WithChude, Tega said she found out about her husband cheating on her when she went into a trance and from their neighbours. When asked if her husband cheated on her, Tega stated that she got to know “spiritually” before finding out from the neighbours. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
