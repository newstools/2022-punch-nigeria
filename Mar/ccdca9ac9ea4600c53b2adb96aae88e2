A plastic surgeon at the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Enugu, Dr. Ifeanyichukwu Onah has stressed the need for the government to partner with Non-governmental organisations such as Smile Train to ensure more children with cleft deformities have access to free corrective surgeries. Onah, according to a statement, said that the government is currently involved with the immunisation of children and should use that model to reach out to all children born with cleft. He said, “The immunisation model targets both children and parents, making it easier to administer. So, we will love to have partnerships with the government so that when they do immunisation, the work of Smile Train and other NGOs involved in cleft surgeries can be advertised and people who know those with cleft deformities can inform them about where to get the free treatment done,” he said. “Globally, it is estimated that a baby is born with a cleft deformity every three minutes. On average, one in every 500 to 750 live births results in a cleft. While an estimated 19,000 children are born with the condition annually in Africa, about 6,186 babies are born with it in Nigeria every year.” Onah noted that the government could also increase the drive for health insurance which covers children with cleft deformities. “But if we continue to have below five per cent of Nigerians covered with health insurance, as we do now, quite a lot of people with a cleft will struggle with knowing where to go and how to get treatment,” he added. Smile Train, according to the statement, has over the years continued to dispel myths and misinformation surrounding cleft, providing funding, training and resources to medical professionals, empowering them to offer free, safe, timely and comprehensive cleft care all year round within the community.
