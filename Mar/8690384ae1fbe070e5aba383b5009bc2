The Vice-Chancellor of the University, Professor Abiodun Adebayo, disclosed this while addressing the students at the matriculation in Ota, Ogun, on Friday. Adebayo, in his speech, said that being bonafide students of Covenant University, the students were guaranteed the right and privilege of studentship, having subscribed to the oath of allegiance of the University. He said that the 1,930 students comprised 1,807 undergraduate students and 123 postgraduate students. The Vice-Chancellor also noted that the university had produced over 20,000 graduates and they were all excelling in their various professions. “The University has continued to receive national and global validations on the positive impact of its unique approach to tertiary education,” Adebayo said. It was also gathered earlier that the Chancellor of the University, Dr David Oyedepo, said that the institution’s training had been geared towards raising a new generation of leaders through a broad-based qualitative education. “The institution’s mandate is powered by our philosophy of departing from skill, knowledge to empowerment, figures to future-building, legalism to realism, points to facts, mathematics to ‘life-matics,” Oyedepo was quoted. The chancellor noted that until one was transformed, he could not reform his environment, society or nation, adding that this was why the institution started focusing on equipping students. The Pro-Chancellor of the Institution, Bishop David Abioye, said that the University presented a set of life-changing core values which helped in training each student for a productive life. He equally admonished the students to embrace the values to excel in their various endeavours Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
