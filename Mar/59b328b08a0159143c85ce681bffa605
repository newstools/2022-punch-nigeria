Operatives of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Kano State Command, have arrested a man, Ahmad Abdulsalam, over alleged illegal possession of 22 registered Airtel SIM cards and 14 Fidelity Bank ATM cards with different names. The Kano State Commandant of the corps, Adamu Zakari, who disclosed this on Tuesday, described the arrest as remarkable. He said operatives of the command, while on duty on Saturday, March 12, sighted the suspect activating some ATM cards at Fidelity Bank. “Our men suspected foul play when Abdussalam failed to provide a satisfactory answer in connection to the 14 ATM cards found in his possession. “Upon interrogation, he linked us to one Umar Surajo, who allegedly masterminded the crime. “Upon further interrogation, Abdussalam confessed that he was employed by Surajo, who directed him to go to the bank and activate the cards at the ATM machine,” the commandant added. Zakari maintained that an agent of Airtel, Muhammad Ali, was also apprehended in connection with the crime. He said, “Our investigation revealed that those ATM cards were obtained from innocent villagers who did not know the implication of selling their ATM cards. “The suspect goes to rural areas, deceive them to open bank accounts for them and process the ATM cards and later buy each card at the sum of N300.” The commandant warned members of the public against selling their ATM cards, stressing that investigation revealed that such cards were used to perpetrate different financial crimes, including financing of terrorism, money laundering, payment of ransom to kidnappers, among others.
