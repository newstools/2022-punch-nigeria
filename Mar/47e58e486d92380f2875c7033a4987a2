The Kubwa Hoteliers Association and a community leader, Capt Aliyu Garba (retd.), have presented a patrol van and a community policing centre to the police in Abuja. The donations were made to the police division in Kubwa, a satellite town in the Federal Capital Territory. Speaking at the presentation on Thursday, the Chairman of the hoteliers association, Mr George Uduokhai, said the vehicle was meant to assist the police in their operations. He assured that the hoteliers would continue to support the police in their efforts to address crime and criminality, adding that a crime-free society would also boost the hospitality business. Uduokhai said his association had been supporting the police with finance every quarter, adding that his members would also be responsible for the maintenance and fuelling of the patrol van. Garba, who donated to the community police centre, promised continued support for the police and encouraged the hoteliers to complete an abandoned office structure in the police division. The Area Commander, ACP Mohammed Shebe, expressed gratitude for the donation, noting that this would further encourage the police to put in their best in securing the community. “The police crave more of this support and robust partnership to be able to secure the community in a way that would encourage business activities to thrive in Kubwa and promote peaceful co-existence,” he said.
