The Lagos State Government has commenced the publication of details of sex offenders, as part of the state’s zero-tolerance to all forms of domestic and sexual violence. This was disclosed by the Executive Secretary of the Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency, Titilola Vivour Adeniyi, during a press conference at the agency’s office on Thursday. Adeniyi stated that the details include the name and picture of the sex offender, the nature of the offence, as well as the duration of the sentence handed down by the court. She noted that the publication of the details of sex offenders was in line with the provisions of the Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency Law, particularly section 42 which mandates the DSVA to periodically publish details of persons convicted of sexual offences in the state. Adeniyi added that letters of advisory had been issued to Local Governments and traditional rulers of the communities where the convicts previously resided.  All details of sex convicts will be published on the State Government’s website, (www.lagosstate.gov.ng); the website of the Ministry of Justice (https://lagosstatemoj.org); and the Agency’s website, (www.dsvrtlagos.org), periodically. Adeniyi reiterated the government’s stance in preventing incidents of sexual and domestic abuse and also ensuring justice for survivors. She stated that Lagosians who wished to report any case of domestic and sexual violence should call the toll-free number, 08000333333. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
