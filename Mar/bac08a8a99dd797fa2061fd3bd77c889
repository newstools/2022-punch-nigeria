The Executive Secretary of the Kogi State Office for Disability Affairs, Zacheus Michael, has called on People Living with Disabilities to rally round Governor Yahaya Bello in his quest to become the nation’s President in 2023. In a statement issued in Lokoja, Michael noted that Bello’s love for the PLWDs was unparalleled and he, therefore, deserved to be supported to become the President so that he could do more for them. The executive secretary pointed out that Bello had yearly surpassed the employment quota for the PLWDs, adding that his efforts on their welfare and wellbeing were well documented. “Bello has shown over a period of six years that if given the chance to become the President in 2023, he will carry everyone along, including the disabled, because he believes there is ability in disabilities,” Michael stated. The lawyer said he had begun mobilisation of the PLWDs across the country towards supporting Bello’s presidential aspiration, and expressed satisfaction with the acceptance of the governor across the country. He urged Nigerians to cultivate habits that would lead to the reduction of street begging and unemployment among the PLWDs through skills development, describing them as special people with passion for the development of the country. He called on government at all levels to give the PLWDs a sense of belonging in appointments and employment opportunities. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
