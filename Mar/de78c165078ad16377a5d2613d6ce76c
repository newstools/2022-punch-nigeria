The joint committee of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, the National Universities Commission and the National Information Technology Development Agency is set to submit the report of the integrity test on the University Transparency Accountability Solution on Tuesday. One of the demands of ASUU is the deployment of the UTAS payment platform for university lecturers instead of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System. The PUNCH had reported that ASUU kicked against the use of the IPPIS platform for the payment of lecturers. The union had also accused the Federal Government of trying to impose the IPPIS on its members by withholding the salaries of those who failed to register on the platform. But the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, said the joint committee, which was set up to look into the UTAS platform, would submit its reports on Tuesday. He stated, “Regarding the issue of UTAS, a joint committee of ASUU, the NUC and the NITDA is to conduct an integrity test on the platform in conjunction with neutral experts. “We told them to conclude the test by March 8. If they conclude the test, we are expected to work on it within six weeks.” Meanwhile the ongoing warning strike by ASUU entered its final week today. The Federal Government and the union have been engaged in a series of negotiations in a bid to prevent ASUU from embarking on the indefinite strike. Some of ASUU’s demands to call off the strike include the payment of earned allowances to university lecturers, deployment of the UTAS payment platform and the release of revitalisation funds to the universities, among others.
