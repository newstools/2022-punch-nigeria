The Lekki Concession Company Limited has announced that plans have been perfected to recommence toll operations at the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge. This is coming about 18 months after tolling was suspended at the bridge following the aftermath of protests against police brutality and extrajudicial killings in Lagos State in October 2020. The Managing Director of the LCC, Yomi Omomuwasan, who announced the plan, said that tolling will commence on April 1, 2022, on the Lekki-Ikoyi link bridge. The LCC boss also announced that commuters plying the corridor will not be paying any toll for the first two weeks until 15th April 2022. According to Omomuwasan, the resumption of tolling at the bridge is coming after extensive consultations with, and support of key stakeholders including the Residents Associations, Traditional Rulers, Community Leaders, professional bodies as well as the Lagos State Government. “We have introduced new technology and innovations to make passage at the Toll Plaza seamless and faster for commuters. We are replacing the old toll device with upgraded ones for faster throughput at the Toll Plaza. “The new devices have been configured to synchronise with the newly upgraded tolling systems and will improve functionally while enabling a better experience at the Toll Plaza,” the LCC boss said in the announcement. With the newly introduced devices, Omomuwasan assured commuters that the LCC was back for effective and seamless operations. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
