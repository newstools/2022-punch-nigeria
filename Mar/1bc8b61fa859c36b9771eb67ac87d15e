The Metropolitan Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, Most Revd Ignatius Kaigama, on Sunday called on the Federal Government to put an end to wanton killings in the country. He said the plea became necessary because of the reported attacks in Kagoro community in the Southern part of Kaduna which left no fewer than 34 people dead, with over 200 houses and 32 shops razed. Kaigama spoke at the Our Lady Help of Christians Internally Displaced Persons outstation in Dagba, Abuja. He said, “We continue to affirm that the path of war is the path of irrationality which leaves the ugly scars on the face of humanity. Wars never end conflicts; instead, they destroy the very lives, dignity and freedom of human beings they claim to defend. “As we continue to pray for forgiveness, reconciliation, healing and peace in all troubled regions of the world, we identify with the people of the Kagoro community in Kaduna State who suffered yet another brutal attack on March 20, 2022, by yet-to-be-identified gunmen, leaving not less than 34 people dead, with over 200 houses and 32 shops razed down.” “Enough of this violence and bloodshed. How much more can this and similar atrocities in parts of Nigeria take place before decisive actions are taken by the authorities concerned? “Having prayed fervently for Ukraine, let us pray for Southern Kaduna and those areas in Nigeria where killings, kidnappings, banditry seem to have become normal phenomena. “We implore the help of our God to bring these killings and destructions to a rapid and definitive end, so that we can truly rejoice not only today, but always.”  Copyright PUNCH.
