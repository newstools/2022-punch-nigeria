The Governor-elect of Anambra State, Chukwuma Soludo, has appreciated the Chairman of the Anambra State Governorship Transition Committee Report, Oby Ezekwesili, on their report. Soludo had on Saturday received the 120-page transition committee report from Ezekwesili. In a Facebook post on Sunday, Soludo appreciated the committee describing the hand over of the report as a historic milestone. He wrote, “Yesterday, I received the Report of the Anambra 2022 Transition Committee. This, for me, is another historic milestone in our ongoing transition process. “I want to thank my beloved sister, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, and her team for their invaluable contributions. “The success of this committee of initially 80 persons and an additional 50, within a 6-week period, is another evidence of the enormous possibilities that abound when technology is effectively deployed by a people driven by patriotism, and love for the Homeland. “The substance of the document is more than enough proof that not a minute of waste was entertained in the course of this assignment. “If we must make progress in our proposed journey to a Liveable and Prosperous Smart Megacity, then arbitrariness must give way for strategic actions. “I really cannot thank this committee enough for availing ndị Anambra their time, talent and treasure. I am committed to ensuring that their effort does not fall to ruin. God bless you all immensely.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
