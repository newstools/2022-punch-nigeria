A group, Senator Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has commenced public sensitisation in Kwara State on the major transformations that Nigeria would witness if the All Progressives Congress National Leader, Bola Tinubu, wins the presidential contest in 2023. The public sensitisation began after a well-attended state meeting of the group held on the premises of Barakat Secondary School, Ilorin, on Saturday. The sensitisation programme of the group involved advocacy visits to political leaders and influential individuals within the state as well as house-to-house and person-to-person discussions. Earlier, the State Director of the group, Dr Wole Alawode, urged the members to remain steadfast and committed in their support for Tinubu’s ambition. He assured that if Tinubu wins the presidency next year, “there will be a noticeable transformation of the country and marked improvement in the various sectors critical to national development.” Alawode reminded the members of the legacies of Tinubu when he governed Lagos State, saying he would perform greater feats if elected to govern Nigeria. “Tinubu puts systems in place in Lagos, and that has been working perfectly well for Lagos. I believe what our leaders said that he will put an end to excuses in government and restore excuses with performance. “We need systems that work in Nigeria, and we need a leader who understands the complexities of national development. Asiwaju is our best option at this material time,” he reasoned. Alawode urged all the members to disseminate the message of Tinubu’s progressive leadership and good plans for the nation to all households and every political group and circle within the state.
