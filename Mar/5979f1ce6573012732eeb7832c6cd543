Nigeria’s Asisat Oshoala has extended her contract with FC Barcelona to June 30, 2024. The forward’s contract with the Club was due to expire at the end of this season. She signed the new contract in the presence of club’s president Joan Laporta and director Xavier Puig in the president’s office at Camp Nou. The 27-year-old Nigerian joined Barça on January 31, 2019, and has proved her enormous appetite for goalscoring. She has scored 80 goals in 101 competitive games, already making her the sixth-highest goalscorer in the team’s history. She scored her first Barça goal in a Champions League final in Budapest. She is currently the leading goalscorer in the Primera Iberdrola league with 16 goals in 19 games. Despite her young age, she is already a major player in world football: she is the record-holder for the African Footballer of the Year awards and was recently feted as the Best African Female Footballer of the decade. Asisat Oshoala said, “I am very happy to continue with the world’s best team. Not just for the football, but because off the pitch, they are also best at looking after players and helping them to continue improving. “I am a forward and I want to carry on scoring goals. The aim is to continue developing and to be happy.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
