No fewer than eight persons have been reportedly killed during a renewed supremacy battle between members of Eiye and Aiye confraternities in Sagamu, Ogun State. The fresh killings occurred on Sunday a few days after seven persons were killed in different parts of Abeokuta, the state’s capital. Our correspondent gathered that 15 persons have been killed in less than two weeks in Abeokuta and Sagamu. The clash between the rival cult groups got to its peak following the gruesome murder of an area boy popularly known as Tommy in Oluwo, Abeokuta. Our correspondent further gathered that as of Sunday evening, residents in Panseke, Onikolobo, Oluwo, Adigbe fled for their lives as gunshots rent the air. Though the police had said 18 persons have been arrested, calm seems not to have been restored as the crisis has now escalated to Sagamu, Remo axis of Ogun. As early as 7 am on Sunday, sources said some young men stormed some places in Sagamu and killed their targets. The source said the bodies of the victims were picked up by the police, others were said to have been taken away by their parents. According to the source, one Akeem, an electrician was killed in the Ajegunle area of Sagamu around 7 am.

That was how he died eventually. His intestines were coming out because he was shot in the stomach.” It was also gathered that some of the victims were murdered in places like Soyindo, Ijagba, Ajegunle, and Sabo; all in Sagamu.
