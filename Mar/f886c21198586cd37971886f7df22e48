Multi-award winning Nigerian singer, Damini Ogulu, popularly known as Burna Boy, has revealed that money does not give him satisfaction. Burna Boy said this on his official Twitter handle in the early hours of Saturday. The Grammy award-winning singer also claimed to be the highest-paid artist in African music history. He stated, “I said money doesn’t satisfy me, and it’s my truth; but it doesn’t change the fact that I’m the highest-paid artist in the History of African music. Believe it or not.” On Friday, Burna Boy announced on his Instagram page that he was not going to be performing at the AfroNation 2022 in Puerto Rico due to circumstances beyond his control. The AfroNation Festival, which celebrates African music with the afrobeats genre as a preference, returns after two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Burna Boy was scheduled to perform alongside a litany of Nigerian stars such as Wizkid, Wande Coal, Ckay, among others. “I’m extremely gutted that I won’t be at the AfroNation in Puerto Rico, due to circumstances beyond anyone’s control. I will make it up to you all for sure! Love, Damini,” Burna Boy wrote. However, since Burna Boy’s withdrawal, the organisers have replaced his act with American rapper Rick Ross. Copyright PUNCH.
