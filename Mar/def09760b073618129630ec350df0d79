The United Kingdom Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace, has accused the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, of saying “all of us are at risk” as the war in Ukraine continued. He stated this at the Conservative Party Spring Conference at Blackpool on Saturday. Wallace praised the UK’s response to the war in Ukraine and hinted that more equipment was on the way. “Putin has been clear in his threats that all of us are at risk,” he said, stressing that the UK is standing beside “our NATO comrades” in other parts of Europe.
