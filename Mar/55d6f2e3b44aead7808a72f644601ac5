A man, Kama Hammajoda, has allegedly attacked his girlfriend, Ladi Ishaku, with liquid substance suspected to be acid in Adamawa State. Ishaku, who is currently receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital in Yola, the state capital, was on Sunday allegedly bathed with acid by Hammajoda, an auto mechanic based in Song. Narrating why she suspects Hammajoda, a jilted lover, orchestrated the attacks against her, Ladi said, “He had threatened my life when I told him that our relationship would not lead to marriage. “I refused to marry him because I sensed he was lying to me about virtually everything. For instance, He told me that he was not married, but I found out he lied about it. “I confronted him about it, and in a heated argument, I told him I won’t marry him; so he threatened me saying if I don’t marry him, everyone will lose. “Shortly thereafter, my mother was burnt to death in her room; but as of that time, I couldn’t link it to Hammajoda’s threat. “Last Sunday, I was lying down in the open within our compound due to power outage when someone tiptoed in the dark and poured acid on me.” Hammajoda, who is currently in police detention at the Criminal Investigation Department in connection with the crime, has denied the allegation.
