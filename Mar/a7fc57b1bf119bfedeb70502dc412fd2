Ekiti State Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development, Maryam Ogunlade, says no fewer than 11 mentally challenged persons and miscreants have been removed from the streets of Ado and Ikere Ekiti for rehabilitation by the state government. Ogunlade said that the exercise, which would be carried out across the state, was borne out of the commitment of the Dr Kayode Fayemi administration to the welfare of all categories of people in the state. The commissioner, in a statement titled, ‘Ekiti rounds up mentally challenged for rehabilitation’, added, “The move is also targeted at boosting security of lives and property of the people. Investigations have shown that kidnappers and miscreants sometimes disguise as beggars and lunatics to carry out their nefarious activities. According to her, categories of persons targeted during the exercise included street beggars, destitute persons, miscreants. She explained that the exercise would be carried out across the state. “The exercise is also aimed at providing proper care as well as psycho-social support for genuine beggars, miscreants and mentally challenged persons. They will be reintegrated into the society and their respective families as soon as they are fit enough to do so,” the commissioner said. Ogunlade said that the exercise was carried out according to global best practices and in collaboration with law enforcement agencies to avoid undue interruption and resistance. Also, the Executive Secretary, Office of Disability Affairs, Mrs Olabisi Fatoba, disclosed that adequate arrangement had been made for the care of those picked. He added that they would be allowed to join their families and society when considered fully rehabilitated. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
