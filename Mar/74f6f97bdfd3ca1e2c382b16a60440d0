The traditional ruler of Onijimo of Ijumo-Jesa, Osun State, Oba Oyebola Esan, on Thursday, testified before Justice S. Solebo of the Ikeja High Court that a fraud suspect, Philemon Gora, defrauded him. The monarch, who is the owner of Liberitas Plc, said Gora, through one of his companies, Gracious Environ Workers and Planners Nigeria Limited, allegedly obtained N525m from him. Gora was arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission over offences bordering on obtaining money by false pretences. The defendant was also accused of stealing, issuance of a dud cheque, and money laundering. He was expected to help the monarch convert the money to United Arab Emirate’s Dirham. Investigation revealed that Gora allegedly transferred different sums to his bank accounts and some Bureau De Change operators. During the Thursday sitting, the monarch’s counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo, asked him to explain what happened to him in May 2021. Esan said, “I consulted FORSA, a company in South Africa, to help me carry out some building construction here in Nigeria after which I asked my business associate, Olamayowa Olabisi, to source for the currency. “Gora conspired with some people to represent Gracious Environ Workers and Planners Nigeria Limited and collected the sum in order to help convert it. “The payment was made to the company on May 27, 2022, and I am yet to receive back any value in any form up till date. “I realised after investigation that Gora is the leader of a fraud syndicate that swindles clients out of their property and leave them in pain, sorrow and in debt.” Justice Solebo adjourned the matter till May 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 respectively.
