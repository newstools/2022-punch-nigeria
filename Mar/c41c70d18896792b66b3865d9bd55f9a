Nigerian defender, Kenneth Omeruo, faces a race to be fit for Nigeria’s crucial Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifying playoffs against Ghana next weekend, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The game is now billed for the Baba Yara stadium in Kumasi on March 25, with the return leg at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja four days later. Omeruo, one of the eight defenders listed for the crucial tie by coach Austin Eguavoen, is reportedly nursing an adductors injury. “He (Omeruo) looks to be injured and may miss the next game against Sporting Gijon,” a report on AS Diario Deportivo stated. The former Chelsea defender missed Leganes’ last three games (Girona, CD Mirandés and UD Ibiza) due to the injury. He had earlier played three games for the Spanish side after Nigeria’s ouster from the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. It remains to be seen if the 28-year-old will recover on time for the play-off against Ghana. Should he fail to recover, Alanyaspor’s Chidozie Awaziem – the only central defender named on the standby list — could replace him. Omeruo has made 55 appearances for the Eagles, scoring one goal.
