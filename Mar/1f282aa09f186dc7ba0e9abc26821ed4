The pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, has feared that Nigeria may be heading the Afghanistan way following the Kaduna airport attack by terrorists. Decrying the state of security in the country, Afenifere, on Sunday, urged that the Federal Government must do something immediately about the security situation of the country. In a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, the organisation said, “It is a matter of serious concern that these security infractions happened at a time that the government kept assuring us that it was on top of the situation. Some of these attacks by terrorists even occurred in broad daylight, that of Kaduna airport and that of Enugu for instance. “With terrorists having the audacity to attack a national airport despite all the available security apparatus, it means that hardly is anywhere safe any longer in the country. The Federal Government should immediately allow states to set up their police forces, empower the existing security agencies and stop treating terrorists with kid gloves. These must be done immediately so that Nigeria does not go the Afghanistan way.” The PUNCH reported terrorists attacked the Kaduna International Airport located in Igabi Local Government Area the Kaduna State on Saturday. The terrorists, numbering over 200 took over the airport thereby preventing the take-off of an aircraft. The terrorists also shot and killed a security official attached to the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency, which forced workers at the airport to flee. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
