For violating the Sanitation Law, the Kwara State Government has arrested over 200 people for prosecution. No fewer than 32 offenders were also punished in Kano for a similar offence. Speaking while monitoring the monthly exercise in Ilorin metropolis on Saturday, the Kwara State Commissioner for Environment, Abosede Buraimoh, stated that the tempo of prosecution of environmental law offenders would not stop until the people were ready to comply with the rules. According to her “this monthly sanitation exercise is very peculiar and different; all hands are on deck to make sure there is high compliance.” “People are natural law breakers, so we handle them the way they wanted. We  have  the mobile court and security agencies on the ground for absolute compliance,” she said. Buraimoh stressed that there were plans to extend the enforcement of the law to other areas in the state. She, however, commended the National Union of Road Transportation Workers and the Road Transportation Employees Association of Nigeria’s cooperation in maintaining compliance during the exercise, urging commercial motorcyclists to follow suit or face the wrath of the law. Buraimoh urged the people of the state to complement the efforts of the government in ensuring a hygienic environment. The commissioner also admonished the people to continue to maintain the tempo of cleanliness in their environs, desist from illegal dumping and avoid dumping waste in drainages to avoid flooding as the rainy days are fast approaching..
