New Super Eagles players, Ademola Lookman and Calvin Bassey, are still relishing their debut appearances in the first leg of their Qatar 2022 World Cup play-off against Ghana in Kumasi. Both players were second-half substitutes, with Lookman coming on for Moses Simon, while Bassey replaced Zaidu Sanusi in the 74th minute of the goalless draw at the Baba Yara Stadium. “It was a great experience for me and I really liked it. However, my dream is to have more good memories with the team. The next game will be a tough one for us, but I’m confident we’ll win and if I’m given the chance to play, I’ll do my best for the team,” Leicester City forward Lookman, an U-20 World Cup winner with England, told PUNCH Sports Extra. “The atmosphere was electrifying, I’ve only seen a few of those moments in England.” Relishing the opportunity to play for the Eagles, Bassey confirmed the physicality of the encounter, stating that he’s trying to adjust his game to suit the African style. “It was a nice feeling and a pleasure to play for Nigeria, it’s been a long time coming,” Bassey told PUNCH Sports Extra. “It’s my first time playing in Africa and I’m still adjusting to the physicality and the demands, the weather because it’s harder to breathe. “It’s been amazing since joining the team, I’ve known some of the boys for a while now and they’re always willing to see you develop,” Bassey added.
