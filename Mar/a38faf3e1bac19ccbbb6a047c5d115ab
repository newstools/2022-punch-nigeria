A former senator, Suleiman Hunkuyi, has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party. Hunkuyi joined PDP from the All Progressives Congress shortly before the 2019 general elections. A letter to his ward chairman in Kudan Local Government Area of Kaduna State, announcing his resignation did not state his next line of action. The letter dated February, 2022, did not also signify which political party he is likely to join. The State PDP Secretary, Ibrahim Wosono, also confirmed that the party had received Senator Hunkuyi’s letter. Ibrahim Wosono said, “We confirmed from his ward that they have received his letter. “So, we wish him well, because it is not the first time he is leaving our party. His exit this time will not affect the party in any way.”
