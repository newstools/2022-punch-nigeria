A former Governor of Lagos State and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, is currently meeting with members of the APC Caucus in the House of Representatives. Tinubu had earlier in the day met with the APC Caucus in the Senate. The APC chieftain had last week written to President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; and Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, to inform the caucuses of his intention to meet with them and declare his presidential ambition. Tinubu is a presidential aspirant in the 2023 general elections on the platform of the ruling party. The ex-governor walked into the Conference Room 028 venue of the meeting at 4:25pm. Gbajabiamila, while welcoming Tinubu to the House, described the visit and the meeting as an “epic moment.” Details later… Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
