Gunmen, on Monday morning, attacked the Otoko Divisional Police Headquarters situated in the Obowo Local Government Area of Imo State, leaving two officers injured. Villagers told our correspondent that the attack, which started around 3am, lasted a long time as residents feared for the unknown. A villager said, “We didn’t sleep last night. The sounds of the weapons were terrifying. While many ran into the bushes, others took cover in their houses. You know the Police Divisional Headquarters is situated on the Owerri-Umuahia express road. “Police officers engaged the gunmen and the situation became more terrible. It was as if the world was coming to an end. It was a consistent exchange of gunshots. We haven’t seen this one before. Two policemen were terribly injured and had been rushed to an undisclosed hospital.” Another source said that the gunmen were repelled and they could not gain access into the premises of the police station. “The gunmen were refused by the policemen on duty. They couldn’t gain access so the exchange of fireworks was intense. Two policemen were injured in the line. I don’t know their conditions, presently. “As I speak to you now the area has been condoned off by security agents. People are scared. Everybody is indoors. We are just peeping from the windows. This is very unfortunate,” the source said. The police spokesperson for the Command, Micheal Abattam, when contacted said “It is true” and promised to give the details of the attack in no distant time. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
