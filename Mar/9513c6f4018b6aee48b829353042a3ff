Stakeholders of the Peoples Democratic Party in Kano on Wednesday called on the National Working Committee to urgently dissolve the state party executives. In a communiqué issued at the end of its meeting in Kano, jointly signed by Dr Yusuf Dambatta and Dr Akilu Indabawa, the party called on the NWC to constitute a caretaker committee to handle its affairs through the election period. The party said it has uncovered a desperate plot by the former governor of the state, Senator Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso to control the party’s machinery, while at the same time promoting another party, New Nigeria Peoples Party. Kwankwaso has earlier announced plans to defect to NNPP by the end of March. Also, the stakeholders alleged that Kwankwaso was planning to sabotage the PDP in Kano in 2023 by scuttling the emergence of a PDP candidate, thereby making it possible for the NNPP to field a candidate in the state. They further contended that leaving the party leadership under Kwankwaso, a former Senator would leave millions of supporters in limbo. The communique read, “Time is of the essence since the deadline of selling of nomination forms to respective candidates for different positions is on April 1, 2022. “The meeting expresses fear that if urgent action is not taken, the PDP will end up without candidates, thereby paving the way for NNPP and other political parties.” ‘’To this extent, NWC should swiftly and unequivocally dissolve the Kano State PDP executives and appoint a caretaker committee to handle the affairs of the party through the electioneering period,” the stakeholders said.
