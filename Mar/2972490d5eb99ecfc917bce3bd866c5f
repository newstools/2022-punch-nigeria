The Anambra State Police Command has arrested six suspects for flouting the state government’s ban on illegal revenue collection. Addressing journalists in Awka, on Sunday, the state Commissioner of Police, Echeng Echeng, said the arrest was in line with the state’s commitment to wipe out all criminal elements and other violent crimes in the state. The six suspects were identified as Andrew Chukwueze, 19, of Nkanu East, Enugu State; Emmanuel Charles,18, of Umualoma, Orlu, Imo State; Chigozie Bernard, 20,  of Izza-West, Ebonyi State; Chibueze Nduife, 30, of Ebonyi State; Nnamdi Anyigba, 27, of Enugu State; and Ebuka Ogidi, 25, of Ebonyi State. According to the police, the men were arrested between March 23 and 26, 2022, along Kara Junction, Atani Road, and Obudogwu Road, while collecting revenue illegally from motorists and other members of the public. In a related incident, police operatives in a joint patrol with vigilantes along Ring-Road, Isiagu, Awka, sighted a group of boys suspected to be armed robbers. As the operatives were about to accost the suspects, they reportedly took to their heels and abandoned a bag containing one SMG rifle, one magazine and four live ammunition. Echeng said efforts were ongoing to arrest the fleeing suspects. He said, “The police, as an organisation, are saddled with the constitutional responsibility of protecting lives and property, as well as maintenance of law and order. We assure that the command will not fold its arms and allow some disgruntled elements to make life unbearable for residents.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
