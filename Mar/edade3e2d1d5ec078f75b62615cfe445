THE People’s Democratic Party in Kogi State has expressed worry at the percentage payment of salaries at both the local government and state levels. The party, in a statement on Sunday in Lokoja, said such practice under the leadership of Governor Yahaya Bello, a presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress, was questionable. The statement signed by the party’s Director for Media and Communications, Dayo Onibiyo, read,  “We are worried at these so embarrassingly low and inhuman payments, which are amounting to nothing but added debts to the state profile under domestic profile and the resultant external debts, from their army of borrowings, which when put together, may just sink the state into the hell of debts” It added, “We, therefore, charge the state government to please turn a new leaf in the little time left for it to spend in office before it will be booted out in 2023 by God’s grace through the suffering masses’ and good people of the state’s votes.” Meanwhile, the state Commissioner for Finance, Idris Ashiru, has apologised for the delay and payment of 70 per cent to state workers on Grade Level 8 and above. He explained, “The noticed delay is occasioned by the late receipt as well as the poor January allocation of FAAC figures to the state, the worst in the last four years. “Consequently, the low figure in the distributable revenue share is responsible for the development.” He added, “While we apologise for the delay and the accompany inconveniences, be rest assured of our commitment to the welfare and interest of our workforce.”  Copyright PUNCH.
