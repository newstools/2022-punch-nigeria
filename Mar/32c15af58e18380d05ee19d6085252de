Tomato Jos Farming and Processing Limited has announced the launch of the Jos paste variant of tomato. According to the firm, its tomato paste is packaged in a 65-gram sachet and is produced from fresh tomatoes grown in the country. The company added that this was its first consumer product since the commencement of operations at its factory in Kaduna state in 2021. The firm said First City Monument Bank had in 2019 financed the construction of its tomato paste processing plant located through the Central Bank of Nigeria’s Real Sector Support Facility intervention fund. The firm added that it received other investment supports from Goodwell Investments B.V through Alitheia IDF, VestedWorld, the Acumen Resilient Agriculture Fund, The Morning Star Company, and other private investors. In a statement, the Managing Director of the company, Mira Mehta, said, “It is a dream come true, though entrepreneurship is full of ups and downs, I feel encouraged whenever I see my passion for this business ignite in one of my colleagues. “I am incredibly proud of the Tomato Jos team for their hard work and belief that we could achieve something on this scale. The facility is the only one of its kind in Nigeria that can produce sachet tomato products directly from fresh tomatoes.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
