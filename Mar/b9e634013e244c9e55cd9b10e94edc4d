The management of Otunba Tunwase National Paediatric Centre, Ijebu Ode, Ogun State, an annex of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, has provided free medical care for over 500 residents of Ijebu Ode and its environs. This was held to celebrate the birthday of the founder of First City Monument Bank, Otunba Subomi Balogun, who had  donated the hospital to the UCH Ibadan. The three-day free medical care was held at Oke Aje market, New Market and Erinlu, all within the Ijebu Ode metropolis. The Acting Medical Director of the hospital, Dr Adedayo Williams, in his address, said the gesture was to commemorate the 88th birthday of the banking icon and philanthropist, Balogun, who donated the facility to the UCH Ibadan. Williams noted that there was no better way to celebrate Balogun’s birthday, who he described as humanist par excellence. He said “everyone knows that aside from being a highly cerebral business mogul, Otunba Michael Subomi Balogun is equally a philanthropist of note. This was why he single-handedly built Otunba Tunwase National Paediatric Centre and gave it out to UCH.”
