The popular New Afrika Shrine in Ikeja, Lagos, is expanding its services into a global, live-streaming platform starting this Easter, with performances from top artistes such as Rema, 2Baba and the Cavemen on Afrikashrine.tv. Afrikashrine.tv is a platform where all afrobeat lovers can experience performances and happenings at the New Afrika Shrine, from anywhere in the world. Recall that the original Shrine was created in the seventies by afrobeat originator and legend, Fela Anikulapo Kuti. Following his death in 1997, his eldest children, Femi and Yeni, built the New Afrika Shrine in his honour. The entertainment centre which serves as the venue of the annual Felabration music festival is set to take the magic that is Afrobeat to every nook and cranny of the world. From May 1, 2022, the TV platform will broadcast live everything that takes place in the iconic 2,500-capacity venue. Other artistes that will deliver live performances are Aramide, Chike, Falana, Ayra Starr, Peruzzi, Femi Kuti,  Seun Kuti and Made Kuti. According to a statement sent to Merrymakers, this transformation of the Shrine into a live-stream venue will cater to a full programme of live events, featuring many of Nigeria’s most in-demand artistes. In addition to the sounds from the shrine, there will also be some comedy, dance and drama performances.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
