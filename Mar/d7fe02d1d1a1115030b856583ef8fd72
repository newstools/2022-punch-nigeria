Ahead of the 2022 Qatar World Cup play-off second leg tie, the Confederation of African Football has given approval to the Nigeria Football Federation to have a full capacity stadium of 60,000 spectators for the much-anticipated clash against Ghana. The Super Eagles will host the Black Stars in the reverse fixture of the play-off at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja on Tuesday. The first leg of the encounter ended 0-0 at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi on Friday. The NFF made the request to have 60,000 people at the stadium for the crucial encounter and was promptly granted by CAF. The Africa football governing body had initially approved 30,000 fans for the highly anticipated encounter but with the stakes being much higher, the NFF requested 30,000 more. CAF Friday allowed 40.000 fans for the first leg at the Baba Yara Stadium, Kumasi on Friday. The Eagles will hope to replicate the 2001 feat that saw them draw away to Ghana before beating them 3-0 in Nigeria during the qualifiers for the 2002 World Cup. A first-half brace from Tijani Babangida plus a strike from Victor Agali at the Liberation Stadium, Port Harcourt propelled Nigeria past the Ghanaians.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
