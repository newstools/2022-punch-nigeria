The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has ordered Multichoice Nigeria to introduce a price lock initiative and toll-free customer lines for its customers. The commission said this move was as a result of alleged dominance by the pay-television company. This was contained in a notice issued by the FCCPC to MultiChoice Nigeria. The commission added that the price lock would ensure that subscribers maintain the same subscription fee for a minimum of one year. The notice dated 18 March and signed by the FCCPC Director of Legal Service, Tam. Tamunokonbia said the price lock option would allow subscribers to maintain the same subscription fee for a minimum period of one year, while the toll-free customer service lines across all networks, through which consumers may receive support with respect to MultiChoice Nigeria’s services, must be active for 24 hours on each day. It added that MultiChoice must clearly communicate to its subscribers the channels available within their selected bouquet option. According to the FCCPC, the new toll-free lines along with the already existing toll-free lines must be advertised on all DStv and GOtv platforms. It said these new resolutions are the outcomes of an investigation into allegations of abuse of dominance by the pay television service provider.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
