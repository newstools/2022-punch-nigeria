The Deputy Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Mr Moses Ekpo, has charged the National Boundary Commission to be firm and resolute in its decisions, especially as they concern delicate boundary matters. He charged the commission not only to bark but also to bite if necessary to enforce boundary resolutions in the country. Ekpo, who stated this on Friday during the transborder cooperation sensitisation tour by the NBC officials to the Ini and Ika local government areas of the state, on Friday, said it was frustrating that demarcation activities planned and executed had been sabotaged and abandoned, leading to another round of agitation, crises and indiscriminate killings in such border flashpoints. Represented by Mr Nkopuruk Ekaiko, the Permanent Secretary in his office, the deputy governor said the move had become imperative in order to check persons and communities who were in the habit of flouting the directives and resolutions of the commission. He said, “The NBC should not only bark like a toothless bulldog. It should be prepared to bark and bite if it becomes necessary. “There should be a penalty for individuals, communities and states who have taken the NBC for granted by refusing to cooperate with the commission, especially, in the area of completing most of its abandoned field-tracing exercise and other demarcation activities’”.
