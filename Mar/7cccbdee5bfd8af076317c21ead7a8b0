The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry has warned the Federal Government to separate politics from the security concerns that will characteristically trail the forthcoming 2023 general elections. President of the Chamber, Michael Olawale-Cole, stated this in Lagos on Tuesday during the security meets business dialogue organised by the LCCI. Addressing the gathering, which had in attendance the Secretary to the Federation, Boss Mustapha and security experts across the country’s length and breadth, Olawale-Cole said improvements in peace are indispensable to considerable economic improvement in GDP growth, inflation, and employment. He said: “Without security, the business community cannot thrive. This is the point of confluence where security meets business. And that is the reason for this conference today.” On the forthcoming 2023 general elections, Olawale-Cole warned of the imperativeness of not playing politics with the nation’s security. “As we approach an election year, we recommend that the government separate politics from security and that the security agencies stay off politics. And there is a need to step up enlightenment campaigns against political violence as this could lay an extra burden on our security agencies as they contend with bandits, terrorists, and kidnappers across the country.” Copyright PUNCH.
