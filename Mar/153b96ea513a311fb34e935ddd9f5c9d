The founder of Akin Fadeyi Foundation, Akin Fadeyi has said due to the level of decadence in the country, some Nigerians wished the country should return to the colonial era. Fadeyi said this was an indicator that Nigerians have lost confidence in their leaders. Fadeyi spoke during the launch of “Put on your thinking cap” campaign in Abuja on Thursday. The programme is aimed at educating the electorates ahead of 2023 elections. He said, “Some people are of the view that we should shut down our democracy and return to the colonial era. “While we cannot say they speak for the entire country, they could end up as the aggregate indicator that something is wrong with the confidence people have in our leaders. “Before we know it, mental health institutions would become cash cows in the country as a result of the problems many of us are facing.” Fadeyi , however, urged Nigerians to vote for candidates who have their interests at heart. He said, “We can’t continue to vote for people that come to us without asking critical questions.  Which candidate is genuinely ready to fix our education system and fix the economy of the nation? “Politicians have always been campaigning to fix our refineries but when they get to power, what happens?  Regime after regime, republic after republic, the refineries do not get fixed. “Are citizens right to say that the regulatory sector managing our downstream sector is compromised? Why is it that citizens today are still queuing to get fuel and yet we export crude oil.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
