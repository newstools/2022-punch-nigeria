A chieftain of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change from Kano State, Alhaji  Farouk Abdulaziz, has said the group is not in support of the aspiration Senator Adamu Abdulahi to become the next national chairman of the All Progressives Congress. Abdulaziz, in a statement on Tuesday, said the bloc has made its position known to the President, Major-General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). It read, “We have made our position known to the President and he promised not to support anyone for the position. As it stands, Adamu Abdulahi cannot claim he has full presidential backing. “We have nothing against him but we need someone who was part of the formation of our party from the beginning.  The party has ideals and only those who shared those ideals must lead our party. “It is now going to be an open contest; that is the beauty of democracy and Mr President insists that all the aspirants cleared for that position must face the delegates.” Copyright PUNCH.
