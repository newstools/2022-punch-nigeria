A group, The Osun Masterminds, has demanded a probe into the finances of Osun state during the reign of Minister for Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, as governor of the state. TOM also called on Osun state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, to speak about the state of the government that he inherited, saying that the people deserve to know. Speaking against the backdrop of sharp drop in the monthly allocation accruable to the state, TOM executive director, Dr. Wasiu Alli-Oyeniyi, in a statement obtained in Osogbo on Tuesday, expressed concern over deficit of N375 million that the state got from the Federation Account in February 2022.
