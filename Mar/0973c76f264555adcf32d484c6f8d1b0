A presidential aspirant, Mr Nicolas Felix, has said he is contesting the 2023 election to tackle insecurity in Nigeria. Felix, who was the presidential candidate of the Peoples Coalition Party in the 2019 election, came third after Muhammadu Buhari and Atiku Abubakar. At a briefing in Lagos on Wednesday, the presidential aspirant said he had decided to join the 2023 race to reduce the negative perception about Nigeria globally. He said, “In 2004, I escaped to America; I won a lottery and left Nigeria. I thought I had actually escaped because of the situation in Nigeria. America gave me the opportunity to succeed. I never dreamt of coming back. But everywhere I go, despite having an American passport, they ask me, where are you really from? I tell them Nigeria. Then, I realised I’m only an American on paper. “Politics was never in my blood, but I realised I have to join the race to stop the complaints about Nigeria. I was told that politics is dirty, but my ideology is that you need somebody with clean hands to change it. If you expect those that got the place filthy to clean it up, then you are making a big mistake. “My main agenda is the protection of the citizens and their properties. As of today in Nigeria, security is a mess. The nation is not safe. That is why the number one issue on my agenda is security. Until Nigeria is safe, we cannot witness economic growth. “We have to equip our police officers. Before we crucify the officers, we must upgrade their standard of living. We must increase their salary, give them sophisticated weapons, vehicles and recruit more hands.” Felix added that he would inaugurate innovative policies to reduce the crime rate in the country.
