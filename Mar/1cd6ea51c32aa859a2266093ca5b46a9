The state Commissioner of Police, Friday Eboka, in a statement by the command’s acting spokesperson, Grace Iringe-Koko, said investigation revealed that the incident was make-believe from a movie being recorded in the metropolis. The statement read in part, “The attention of the Rivers State Police Command has been drawn to a video clip trending online about a pastor, who purportedly attempted suicide because his church was not growing in numerical strength. “The Commissioner of Police, Friday Eboka, immediately ordered an investigation into the matter. “Preliminary investigation revealed that the video clip is actually from a movie being recorded by one Encourage Gentle Onyemachi and others at George Raymond Hotel, off Ben Worsley Furniture, Ada George. “Thus, the suicide attempt is make-believe. The Commissioner of Police is therefore using this medium to advise movie producers to notify the police whenever some sensitive scenes are being recorded to enable the latter put in place adequate measures to assuage fears and panic on members of the public. “The media is also encouraged to verify information before publication.” Copyright PUNCH.
