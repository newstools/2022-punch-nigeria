The Anambra State Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, has ordered all public servants and political office holders in the state to start reporting at their places of work every Monday or face serious sanctions. According to a statement by the Head of Service, Mr Theodora Igwegbe, in Awka on Friday, Soludo directed public servants to report to work on Mondays, as they did on other workdays. The governor, while stating that the directive takes immediate effect, added that any worker, who absented himself/herself on Monday without approval would be appropriately sanctioned. Following the Monday sit-at-home order declared by the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, public offices, markets, banks, schools are always shut on Mondays. Workers, traders and others persons have been observing the day as a free day in the entire the South-East. Although, IPOB had continuously issued statements, urging the people to ignore the sit-at-home order, saying that it had since lifted the direct. The statement, titled, ‘Attendance to work’, which was also addressed to the deputy governor, Speaker of the House of Assembly, the chief of staff, all commissioners, all special advisers, permanent secretaries, all heads of ministerial departments, among others, directed them to disseminate the information to the public servants under their supervision and monitor compliance. The statement read in part, “Consequently, absence from duty on Monday or any other official workday without approval will be viewed as serious misconduct which will attract appropriate sanctions.”  Copyright PUNCH.
