Following the terror attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train on Monday night, the list of victims shot and injured by the attackers has been obtained by The PUNCH. The terror suspects had planted explosives devices along the rail track and laid in an ambush whilst the Abuja-Kaduna bound train approached the point – when the device exploded, causing the train to derail. The PUNCH also learnt that the rescued victims had since been moved to the 44 Army Reference Hospital in Kaduna for proper medical treatment following the successful evacuation by emergency services. The list, as obtained by our correspondent, contains 16 victims as follows: Haruna Muhammed; Mohammed Modibo; Ibrahim Wakala; Yakubu Nuhu; Abdulahi Yahaya; Ismail Saidu; Abdumalik Rasheedat; Umar Mohammed. Others on the list are: Hadiza Umar; Musa Ishawan; Aisha Yusuf; Mohammed Ameen; Abubakar Hauwau; Aliyu Sulaiman; Olaosebikan Bilikisu, and Mrs Leola Abdulbasit. See the list:  Copyright PUNCH.
