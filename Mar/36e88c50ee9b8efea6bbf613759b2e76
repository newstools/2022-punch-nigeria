A Non-Governmental Organisation, the Edo-Okpa Unity Forum has kicked against the plan by the Edo State Government to convert Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma to a multi-campus institution. The forum in a statement signed by the Chairman of its Board of Trustees, Mr Peters Evbota and the National Coordinator, Mr Emmanuel Omonua, described the policy as ill-advised and a clandestine way to play politics with the people of Edo Central. The statement on Monday in Benin, said the decision came as a huge surprise to the people in the Edo Central, where the institution was located. Recall that Gov. Godwin Obaseki had on February 18 at a town hall meeting on Edo education policy announced the conversion of the state owned university into three campuses. But the forum said it had resolved at its monthly meeting in February that the institution had been grossly underfunded in recent time by the state government, the situation which the government blamed on paucity of fund. “AAU has been deliberately starved of funds over these years by the government due to these hidden political schemes to crumble the socio-economic power of Esanland,” it said.
