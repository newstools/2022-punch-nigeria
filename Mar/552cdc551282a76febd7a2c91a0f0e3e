President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan has advised women not to lose hope in their demands for legislation on gender-related matters. Lawan spoke in Agasa in Kogi State on Thursday against the backdrop of some gender-related bills that recently failed to scale through at the National Assembly in the ongoing review being carried out on the 1999 Constitution. He also made a strong case for girl child education shortly before he commissioned a 600 capacity JAMB CBT Centre which was facilitated by Senator Yakubu Oseni who is representing Kogi Central Senatorial District. “I know somebody will say gender bills have failed in the National Assembly. That is democracy. Let’s continue to lobby. “We should continue to lobby because nobody will like to undermine anybody. Let’s not lose hope,” Lawan was quoted as saying in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media, Ola Awoniyi. “Every male member in the National Assembly is a “He for She” because I don’t think there is anybody who is not married in the National Assembly. “We will continue to work together with gender-based organisations especially those that genuinely want to engage with members of the National Assembly because if you are not able to get something, if there is a failure, we should make it a political capital that tomorrow, we say, you were not able to do it yesterday, can you do it today. That will help us in ensuring that we get some of these hurdles out of the way. “Most of us have our daughters as well. So we know that everybody is one way or the other connected to this struggle but we should not lose hope,” Lawan said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
