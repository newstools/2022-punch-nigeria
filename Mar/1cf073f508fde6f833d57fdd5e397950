The Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has faulted the new Edo State Independent Electoral Commission law, saying it does not conform with the Electoral Act of 2022. The APC also said it would contest the new law in court and also pull out of the Local Government election, which the law is meant for. Speaking through its Publicity Secretary on Tuesday, Peter Uwadiae, said it is worrisome that a democratically elected government would engage in activities that run contrary to the law, adding that there is no provision in this year’s budget to run an election that will require a humongous amount. He said, “The most important part of the law, a 90 days notice to the parties, has now been shortened to 20 days which should not have been done without the input of the people. “In conducting the election, there must be a synergy between the Electoral Act and ESIEC law. In other words, the provision of the ESIEC law should not run contrary to the provisions of the Electoral Act. And if the law runs contrary to the Act, the Electoral Act should take precedence. “We are very worried that a Governor that was elected democratically will no longer preserve the tenet of democracy. That portends danger for us as Edo people. The APC is boycotting the election because of this aberration. “The new Electoral Act 2022 shows that the local government election is no longer a jamboree. It has been taken beyond the governors sitting in their offices or bedroom and reel out figures for each local government,” he added. He stated that trying to shorten the period for the election would not guarantee a free, fair and credible election. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
