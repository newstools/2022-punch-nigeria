Nollywood actor, Gideon Okeke, has revealed that thespians in the Nigerian movie industry work like slaves despite being underpaid for their roles in various movies in the country. Okeke said their sufferings were invisible to people because when actors and actresses appear at movie premiers, they dress up looking like a bag of money. Using his Instagram handle, Okeke said, “The pay is peanuts, the food is whack, the working conditions are gruesomely slave-like. But come the day of the Red carpet premier… We all dress up looking like a bag of money. E no add up joor! “Award season is coming again. You will see all of us looking like peacocks on the red carpet. Like a bag of money. Don’t envy anyone o. Na packaging. Na wash. “Now dem don even dey give money for best dressed. Taking the light away from the film wey dem come to appraise. You Ign’ant (Ignorant) like the Americans would say, We’z be Ign’ant. “Because filmmaking is a collaborative sport, until it’s time to share money. Ain’t we in a pandemic of greed. Abeg make I go brush teeth. My mouth dey smell.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
