A 73-year-old man, Ohalete Jogoji, has been arrested for allegedly killing his immediate younger brother, Augustine Jogoji, over a land dispute. Our correspondent, who visited Amaraku Junction, in the Isiala Mbano Local Government Area of Imo State, where the incident happened, observed as some youths seized the suspect and stripped him naked. They threatened to beat him up before some youths, led by one Bathram Uwandu, rescued him and took him to the police command headquarters in Owerri. Ohalete, during an interview, said he hacked his younger brother to death while he was asleep. The septuagenarian claimed that Augustine, a truck pusher, diverted the only plot of land belonging to their family. The man, who spoke in Igbo language, said, “I was angry that he took the only land belonging to our family. Instead of me to be in possession of the only portion of land as the first son, he possessed it. I got angry and attacked him.” The suspect’s daughter, who identified herself as Nkiru, said though her father and his younger brother used to have minor issues, she was surprised that the matter went out of control. Uwandu told our correspondent that the suspect attacked his brother while he was asleep in his room. The youth leader said, “This man attacked his brother yesterday (Sunday) while everybody was watching the Chelsea versus Liverpool match. Before help could come, the man had died. We have deposited his body in a mortuary.” The police command spokesperson, Micheal Abattam, had yet to respond to an inquiry from our correspondent on the matter. Copyright PUNCH.
