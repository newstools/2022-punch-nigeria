Almeria striker, Umar Sadiq, has been nominated for the Spanish Segunda Player of The Month for February, after his impressive performances for the club on his return from representing Nigeria at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. He’ll slug it out with Huesca’s Jaime Seone and Eibar’s Jose Corpas for the award. Seone scored three goals in the three games he featured in during the month, while Corpas was on target twice in four games in the month. Sadiq, 25, who has been in superb form for the LaLiga promotion hopefuls, scored five goals and provided two assists in the four league matches he played in February, taking his tally to 13 after match-day 29. He is currently the league’s fifth top scorer. Sadiq is in line to clinch the award after his more impressive goals and assists tally. Since joining the club from Serbian side Partizan Belgrade in the summer of 2020, the Nigeria international has scored 36 goals with16 assists in 69 games across all competitions for the club. His form this season has seen him become a transfer target for some of the top LaLiga sides, including Sevilla, who have been told to pay €60m for his services. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
