The Kano State Government has approved the adjustment of the 2021/2022 school calendar for both public and private primary and secondary schools operating in the state because of the forthcoming Ramadan. Ramadān is the month of fasting and the ninth month of the Muslim calendar that begins and ends with the appearance of the crescent moon. This year’s Ramadan fast is expected to start on April 2. A statement by the Deputy Director, Information, Kano State Ministry of Education, Aliyu Yusuf, explained that the adjustment followed the outcry of parents and other relevant stakeholders on the need by the government to allow their wards to observe complete Ramadan fast at home during the vacation, considering the significance of the month. According to him, one week would be reduced from the 13 weeks earlier scheduled for the second term, while one week would also be added to the vacation which was earlier scheduled to be four weeks. “By this adjustment, therefore, all public and private primary and post-primary schools operating in the state are to be closed for five weeks’ vacation with effect from Friday, April 1, 2022, to Sunday, May 8, 2022,” the statement read. Yusuf said the state Commissioner for Education, Sanusi Kiru, appealed to parents and guardians to be vigilant during the forthcoming vacation.   All rights reserved.
