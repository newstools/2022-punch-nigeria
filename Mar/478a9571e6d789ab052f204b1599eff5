Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, has said calls for the repatriation of artefacts and antiquities of Yoruba origin must be backed with the ability to secure the items when eventually repatriated. Oba Ogunwusi spoke at Igbo Olokun heritage site, Ile-Ife, during the on-site exhibition and opening of the ancient Igbo Olokun Heritage site, where the prominent Ori Olokun bronze head was believed to have been discovered, excavated in 1910 and taken to the British Museum. A statement by the monarch’s spokesperson, Moses Olafare, on Thursday, also said Oba Ogunwusi, declared that he was already working with some tertiary institutions, including Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife to ensure that the artefacts when returned were properly kept for cultural and economic use. He said, “It is good to request and celebrate the repatriation of these artefacts but the most important is for us to plug it appropriately, for cultural and economic use. “That is why we are working with our tertiary institutions including the Obafemi Awolowo University, University of Ibadan and others to ensure that we have a successful repatriation.” Copyright PUNCH.
