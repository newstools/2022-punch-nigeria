The Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr Godwin Emefiele, says Infrastructure Company Limited will commence talks on road infrastructure along the Lagos Free Trade Zone where Dangote refineries and Tolaram group industries are situated. He said road construction would decongest the environment around the LFTZ axis and the development would be in collaboration with the Federal Government and Lagos State government. Emefiele said this during the tour of Lagos Free Zone, in Lagos on Saturday. On the plans to engage Infraco, he said, “The entire idea is that with this Lagos Free Zone port, we should be able to see a total decongestion of Apapa and Tin Can port purely from the stand port  that it would take the traffic away from Apapa. “And we’re also afraid that with the single road that we have, which is the Lagos-Epe-Lekki road that is already congested with traffic, the situation will worsen even with Dangote’s refinery. Yes, it is something that we are seeing and we have come here today, and I have been to Dangote Refinery several times; and I know how long it takes to drive by road. “So, what I’m trying to say that we have realised the problem,  Infraco luckily is chaired by the CBN. The Infraco Board has been formally constituted, there is a CEO in Infraco and as soon as we leave this meeting, I will be calling on Infraco to begin engagement. I will also be involved in engaging the Lagos State Government, as well as the Federal Government through the Federal Ministry of Works to see what can be done; how we decongest the traffic for people living around this axis.” “I want to give assurance that this is something that would be dealt with. This would be a middle to long-term plan.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
