Barely 24 hours after leaving the Peoples Democratic Party, a former Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Kwankwaso, has emerged as the National Leader of the New Nigeria Peoples Party. A copy of the details of his emergency obtained on Wednesday night said he emerged at the party’s convention in Abuja, a day after he dumped the PDP and joined the new party on Tuesday in Abuja. Also, a 39-man new National Executive Committee of the party emerged with Kwankwaso’s supporters, clinching top positions. While Prof. Rufai Alkali, a political scientist, and former National Publicity Secretary of the PDP emerged national chairman, AVM Ifemeje John Chris (retd) was named Deputy National Chairman. The National Secretary is Dipo Olayoku; National Organizing Secretary is Senator Suleiman Hunkuyi while Major Agbo was named National Publicity Secretary, Speaking at the event, Kwankwaso said that he was impressed with the support by his loyalists and supporters of the party. “What remains is for all of us to go back to the grassroots, our states and local governments to register ourselves and families and to tell all Nigerians to register with NNPP. We are all aware that the people are tired of the APC and PDP and that was why previous elections recorded low voter turnout. “We thank God that we have a fresh air for a better new Nigeria. People are tired and want change and the NNPP is the fresh air that can do it,” Kwankwaso said. He also berated the present regime for failing to tackle insecurity lamenting Monday’s train attack in Kaduna, leading to the killing, injury and kidnapping of passengers. Copyright PUNCH.
