Super Eagles head coach, Austin Eguavoen, has invited Lorient midfielder, Innocent Bonke, as a replacement for the injured Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi ahead of Nigeria’s World Cup play-off against Ghana on March 25 and 29. Ndidi sustained a medial ligament injury against Rennes in the Europa Conference League on Thursday, with The Foxes manager Brendan Rodgers announcing after the game that the ever-reliable midfielder “will be out of action for a few weeks.” The injury will last between three to four weeks, which automatically ruled him out of the all-important games against The Black Stars. The injury had left fans worried as they await Eguavoen’s announcement on who replaced the former Genk player. The coach on Sunday, through the Super Eagles Twitter handle, announced the Lorient midfielder as the man to replace the Leicester player. “Camp update: Innocent Bonke has been called up as a replacement for injured Ndidi for the WCQ games against Ghana. Get well quick Wilf,” the statement wrote. Bonke was in action for Nigeria against Cape Verde in Praia in the early stages of the Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifiers, incidentally replacing Ndidi at the time. The 26-year-old has had decent performances for the French club since his move from FF Malmo.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
