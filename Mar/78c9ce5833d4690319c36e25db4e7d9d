The first half of the World Cup qualifier second-leg encounter between Nigeria and Ghana ended 1-1 on Tuesday. Super Eagles defender, William Troost-Ekong, scored a penalty in the 22nd minute to level Ghana’s lead. The Black Stars of Ghana took the lead in the 11th minute through a goal by Thomas Partey. Nigeria host arch-rivals Ghana in the second-leg of the 2022 World Cup playoff on Tuesday with the result deciding which side qualifies for the competition to be played in Qatar later this year. The West African rivals face off at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium in Abuja in what is the decider between the two sides after the first-leg failed to produce a result. The Black Stars were held to a goalless draw in Friday’s match at the Ohene Djan Sports Stadium in Kumasi which left the return encounter delicately poised. Nigeria must win their match against Ghana in Abuja on Tuesday to be able to qualify for the World Cup which would be their fourth successive appearance at the global tournament. Copyright PUNCH.
