Investments in Zimbabwe’s tourism sector grew by 56 million United States dollars, as the sector saw a rise from 86 million U.S. dollars in 2020 to 142 million dollars in 2021. The sector was boosted by a raft of government investment promotion measures. The Information Minister, Monica Mutsvangwa, said that tourism in the country was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic over the past two years, resulting in the loss of about 9,000 jobs and closure of 37 facilities. However, there had been notable progress in reviving the sector. The government had implemented a recovery and growth strategy launched in 2020, which sought to grow the tourism industry to 5 billion U.S. dollars by 2025. Several strategies to revive the sector included campaigns to boost domestic tourism, increased investments in new and existing facilities and increased accessibility of the country through air transport. As economy all over the world became threatened by dwindling oil price, diversification of economy had been the topic across boards. NAN
