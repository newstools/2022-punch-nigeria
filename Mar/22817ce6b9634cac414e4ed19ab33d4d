A yet-to-be identified military man has reportedly killed a 69-year-old, Mr Philip Ajayi, also known as Odua, during an argument over N7,000 in Akure, the Ondo State capital. In the incident which happened at Arakale area of Akure, the deceased, an electrician, was allegedly beaten by his customer (the military man), for not refunding his N7,000 after he failed to repair his radio on time. According to a source, the deceased was hale and hearty before the incident happened. She said, “On this fateful day, the man approached Odua for the refund of his money, but the deceased explained to him that the work had reached 80 per cent completion stage. “Before we know what was happening, he (the suspect) started beating the deceased.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mrs Fumilayo Odunlami, confirmed the incident but said the police were yet to get details of the suspect to ascertain his real identity, whether he is a real or fake military man. “Investigation has commenced to know the identity of the suspect and arrest him, so he could face the wrath of the law,” the PPRO stated. Meanwhile, the remains of the deceased have been deposited at the University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital mortuary in Akure.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
