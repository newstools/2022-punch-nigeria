Gunmen on Saturday night murdered a horticulturist, Kingsley Nwachukwu, at Nweke market square in Nkwerre community in the Nkwerre Local Government Area of Imo State. The PUNCH gathered that the fleeing gunmen had finished robbing a nearby trader and were fleeing when they opened fire at a group of young men hanging out at a nearby pub. Nwachukwu, who hailed from Amaegbu Umulolo village, was hit by one of the stray bullets released by the criminals and died on the spot. A community leader who pleaded anonymity told our correspondent on Sunday that the killing of Nwachukwu caused unease in the community. He said that the community leader was angry that one of its promising young men was killed in such a circumstance, noting that the incident had been reported at a police station in the area. The community also disclosed that the remains of Nwachukwu, who wore a white coloured cloth, had been evacuated from the scene of the crime. He said, “Nwachukwu is a member of the last Age Grade in Amaegbu village in Nkwerre community. The name of the Age Grade is Umunawuike. It is just one year now the Age Grade was officially inaugurated in the community. This is one death too many.” Our correspondent saw a lifeless photo of the victim circulating on a section of social media in the state. The spokesperson for the police in the state, Micheal Abattam, had yet to respond to an inquiry concerning the incident. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
