Ahead of July 16 governorship poll, Osun State Chairman of the Peoples Redemption Party, Abiodun Afolabi, has called on the electorate to reject the ruling All Progressives Congress and the main opposition, the Peoples Democratic Party. Afolabi, who spoke in Osogbo in an exclusive chat with the Sunday PUNCH, said that both the APC and the PDP had had their times managing affairs of the State and failed to make positive impacts. He said the PRP should be considered and allowed to rule the state and see a difference, adding that the party had programmes carefully designed to improve the standard of living of the masses. “PDP had ruled Osun in the past, no serious impacts on the lives of the masses. APC has been in the saddle for almost 12 years now, what difference has the party made? None. “I call on the electorate not to vote APC. They should also reject PDP in the next governorship poll. “The two parties had their times and failed to make impact. Let’s us allow Peoples Redemption Party, to manage the affairs of this state and see a difference,” Afolabi concluded Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
