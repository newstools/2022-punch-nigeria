Cameroon goalkeeper, Andre Onana, was reportedly involved in a ghastly accident on his way to Douala from the country’s capital, Yaounde. The Ajax star was travelling by road to join the rest of the Cameroon squad in preparation for their doubleheader 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers fixture against Algeria. However, a report from a Cameroon -based journalist, Njie Enow, via his Twitter handle, @NjieEnow, stated that the goalkeeper was unhurt in the accident and was still focused on the matches against The Desert Foxes. “Andre Onana is fine. I just had a word with Cameroon and Ajax keeper Andre Onana after his accident this morning. “He told me ‘I’m ok and I’m heading to the camp. We have a crucial game’,” Enow wrote. Apart from the cars involved in the accident, no casualties were recorded, the reports indicate. Onana was among the Cameroon squad that won the bronze medal in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations hosted by his country. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
