Ahead of their 2022 Qatar World Cup play-off clash against Nigeria later this month, Ghana has been dealt a blow following an injury to Accra Hearts of Oak goalkeeper Richard Attah. The Eagles and the Black Stars are set for a double-header clash for a ticket to football’s  biggest showpiece in Qatar. The first of the two-leg clash is scheduled for Cape Coast Stadium on March 25, while the return leg holds four days later at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja. The shot-stopper, who was only the fourth choice for the Black Stars at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, has been backed in recent weeks to become No.1 following his impressive performance for Hearts in the Ghana Premier League. On Sunday, he was in action for Hearts in their match-day 20 against Aduana Stars but was stretchered off after just 32 minutes into the game, after picking up an injury. The extent of the injury is yet to be revealed but it comes as a huge blow to the Black Stars, who are hoping to have their best players available for the Eagles clash.  Copyright PUNCH.
