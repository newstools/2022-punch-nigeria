The Ebonyi State Government on Sunday said a former commissioner for Information, in the state, Chief Abia Onyike, lied when he alleged his property was attacked by members of the Ebubeagu security outfit. The Special Security Consultant to the state government, Chief Stanley Okoro-Emegha, stated this during a press briefing, in Abakaliki. He condemned the alleged attack on Onyike’s property, stressing that it was a calculated attempt by him to malign the administration of Governor David Umahi. He said the former commissioner should desist from accusing Ebubeagu security outfit of invading his property, maintaining that the operatives were conscious of their lawful duties of assisting other security agencies to secure the state. He said, “I want now tell you that the Abia State I know cannot condone such an attack if he was not the person that orchestrated it just to ignite war in favour of himself and his political party. “He is notorious in giving false alarm. He has, for years, been accusing the governor of planning to assassinate him, even when the governor doesn’t know he exists. The attack on Abia Onyike’s house is purely stage-managed. Ebubeagu has no hand in it. “I wish to advise them to stop showcasing their treacherous, unintelligent and deceitful approaches to take over the seat of power because the Umahi government and the good people of Ebonyi State have no doubt that the appellate court will soon upturn the judgement of the Federal High Court Abuja that has suddenly become a dangerous liquor intoxicating their pitiable being.” Copyright PUNCH.
