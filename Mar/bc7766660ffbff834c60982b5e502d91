The Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, Mele Kyari, has said the NNPC has nothing to hide and will comply with the request of the House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts. Kyari disclosed this following the request by the House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts seeking the appearance of heads of NNPC subsidiaries before the lawmakers. According to the News Agency of Nigeria, the NNPC boss in a statement issued in Abuja, said the company would comply with the committee’s requirement and continue to be accountable and transparent. He said, “We have nothing to hide, Mr Chairman. We recognise that this company belongs to over 200 million Nigerians as its shareholders, thus we have been accountable and transparent and we will continue to remain so. “No national oil company in the world is as transparent as we are. We shall comply with the House committee’s requirement.” The committee had on March 16, through a letter signed by its Chairman, Oluwole Oke (PDP: Osun), summoned the 17 subsidiaries of NNPC to respond to audit queries by the Auditor-General for the Federation over the operations of their finances between 2014 and 2019.
