The Chief of Civil Military Affairs (Army), Maj Gen Markus Kangye, has said the Nigerian Army received and treated over 500 complaints about human rights violations across the country between 2016 and now. He said all the complaints received had been investigated, adding that some were true, while some were not. Kangye, who spoke during the first quarter civil military cooperation on Tuesday in Abuja, stated that appropriate sanctions had been recommended for those found culpable. He expressed the readiness of the service to address alleged human rights violations by troops during internal security and counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations. He said, “Since inception, the desk has received over 500 complaints, which were treated and appropriate sanctions applied where necessary. “Thus, available statistics show that there has been a drastic reduction in litigation involving Nigerian Army personnel in recent times. “This could be attributed to the constant sensitisation workshops on human rights conducted across the divisions and formations coupled with the impact of the desk’s sanctions on offenders.” “This underscores the premium the CoAS places on human rights issues. In order to drive this policy, a 24-hour call centre with a designated short code, 193, was established on May 30, 2017 to receive emergency calls.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
