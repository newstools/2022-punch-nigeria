A filmmaker, Uduak Isong, has said her new movie, Beautiful People, explores relationships across different generations. According to her, it is a story of three generations of women— a teenager on a journey of self discovery, a middle-aged woman afraid to commit again after a broken relationship, and a woman in her fifties seeking a fresh start. “It is a timely and relevant story exploring one’s desire and right to pursue happiness against several odds,” she added. In a statement sent to Sunday Scoop, Isong, who recently bagged a Master’s degree in Film from the University of Kent, United Kingdom, said, “I made this film primarily to entertain but also to provoke and initiate conversations about gender roles, particularly in family settings.” The movie, which features actors such as Kanayo Kanayo, Clarion Chukwurah, Chioma Chukwukah, Deyemi Okanlanwon and Yvonne Jegede, will be premiered in London, UK. Immediately after the movie screening, guests will be hosted to a cocktail party where there will be a question and answer session to be handled by Isong. Other films directed by Isong include Falling and Okon Lagos. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
