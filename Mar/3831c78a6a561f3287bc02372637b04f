In a statement released on Monday, signed by the founder, KAMAF and made available to journalists in Abuja, the speaker who was represented by the member, House of Representatives representing Ikenne/Sagamu Federal Constituency, Adewunmi Onanuga, also pledged support for women’s development and KAMAF. Onanuga said, “There is a need for better education. We as members of the House of Representatives recognise the need for good, quality education for Nigerians and most especially, for the girl child. “The education reform bill which has reached its second reading in the House of Representatives is a critical bill that would accelerate our efforts towards improving the educational sector particularly for the Girl Child. “We however pledge our continuous support to KAMAf and women development in Nigeria.” Also speaking at the event, the Minister of Women Affairs, Dame Tallen, commended the efforts of the group towards the creation of opportunities for girls and other vulnerable children in the society.
