The Abuja stadium is expected to be filled to capacity with tickets for popular side sold for N2,000, while the VIP section goes for as much as N25,000 to N50,000. The hospitality section for the VVIPs lounge goes for as much as N2m. The VVIPs will enjoy exquisite services such as marquee, screens and lighting, lounge seating and cocktail tables. The VVIPs will also be able to meet, greet, take pictures and get autographs from their favourite Eagles players. A fan Sheriff Adamu can’t wait for match day. “We are going to storm the stadium on Tuesday,” Adamu told our correspondent. “I have four tickets here with me and I’m going to get more. Some of my friends have indicated interest in attending the game so we will definitely be storming that place. We will tell Ghanaians that we are football lovers too, even more passionate.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
