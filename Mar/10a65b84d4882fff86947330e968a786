Aloy Ejimakor, a Special Counsel for the detained leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, has urged the Federal Government to release the IPOB leader. He urged the Nigerian government to emulate Benin Republic’s gesture of releasing Yoruba Nation activist, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Igboho. The lawyer made this known in a tweet on Monday. “The release of Igboho by Benin Republic has validated the universal law that #SelfDetermination is neither a crime nor an extraditable offense. If it is, Igboho would’ve been extradited to Nigeria. “If Nigeria fails to reverse its injustice to #NnamdiKanu, its courts must.” The PUNCH had reported that Igboho had been released from prison in Benin Republic to meet his medical practitioners. Kanu, who is facing an 11-count charge of treason, treasonable felony, terrorism, and illegal possession of firearms, among others, allegedly jumped bail in 2017 and left the country, only to re-emerge in Israel and then in the United Kingdom. The former London estate agent was rearrested in June 2021. He was initially arrested in late 2015 after calling for a separate state for Biafra, in South-East Nigeria. He was re-arraigned before a Federal High Court in Abuja and ordered to be remanded in the custody of the DSS, while the case was adjourned. Following the sudden appearance of Kanu in a Federal High Court in Abuja on June 29, 2021, the Attorney-General of Nigeria, Abubakar Malami, SAN, at a press conference, stated that Kanu was “intercepted through the collaborative efforts of Nigerian intelligence and Security Services”.
