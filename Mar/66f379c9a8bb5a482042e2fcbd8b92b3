The Enugu State chapter of the Nigeria Union of Pensioners, on Tuesday, appealed to Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi to pay the gratuities of retirees and ensure prompt payment of pensions. The pensioners made the appeal during the inauguration of the newly elected members of Enugu State Administrative
Committee of the NUP held at the Enugu Main Sub-treasury office of the union. According to the pensioners, gratuity was last paid in 2010 during the administration of Governor Sullivan Chime, while the pensions were being paid in arrears in some cases two years. In his inaugural speech, the new Chairman of the committee, Comrade Ekere Ikechukwu, recalled how Governor Ugwuanyi in 2019 during his second term election promised the senior citizens that if re-elected he would ensure prompt payment of gratuities and pensions. Regrettably, Ekere said that pensions are currently paid in arrears, while gratuity, he described as “a-no-go-area”. He, however, enjoined the members to see the emergence of his EXCO as a “divine obligation to lead and not to rule and to thank God for making the opportunity feasible.” Copyright PUNCH.
