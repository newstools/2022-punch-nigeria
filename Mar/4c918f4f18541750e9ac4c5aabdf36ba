Enugu Rangers and Heartland returned to winning ways in their matchday 17 Nigeria Professional Football League encounters on Saturday after failing to get wins in their last outing. Rangers were held to a 1-1 draw by Shooting Stars in Ibadan while new Heartland coach Erasmus Onuh suffered his first loss in their 3-1 loss away at Sunshine Stars on Wednesday. However, both teams bounced back from the disappointment to get wins. Chidiebere Nwobodo’s 49th minute strike handed Rangers the maximum points and their seventh win of the season as they temporarily moved above champions Akwa United who are billed to play their matchday 17 fixture on Sunday (today) away at Abia Warriors at the Okigwe Township Stadium. “It is a team game and I am delighted for the victory, it was not easy but I am happy we held on for the win and now we look forward to the next game,” Nwobodo said after the win. Onuh will be delighted with the win after the game was decided by Jonas Emmanuel’s 11th minute goal. The win is the third for the manager who joined the club last month with the job of seeing them remain in the league. The Name Millionaires are currently 14th on the league table after the win. They will be hoping to stay consistent ahead of their next encounter against Kwara United.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
