Sparta Rotterdam goalkeeper Maduka Okoye has expressed concern over Watford’s relegation battles in the English Premier League and conceded that it is impossible for him to save them, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Despite being courted by several English Premier League clubs like Crystal Palace, Southampton and Watford, the young shot-stopper chose the Hornets ahead of the others for £6m late last year, but remained at Sparta, on loan till the end of the season. However, these are definitely not the best of times for the Sparta Rotterdam goalkeeper, whose parent club and his loan club are fighting to remain in their respective topflight leagues. In the Dutch league, Henk Fraser’s side occupy the 17th position on the 18-team table, a significant four points away from safety. Having changed managers three times already this season, things don’t look better for the Hornets, who currently sit 19th on the log. Speaking with Rijnmond, the 22-year-old said he was worried that his two clubs were fighting relegation, but assured he would do everything to save his Dutch club. He, however, admitted that there was nothing he could do to save Watford. “It is concerning for me that Watford is also facing relegation, but I can only help Sparta now,” Okoye told Rijnmond. “I will do everything I can to keep Sparta in the Eredivisie. I can’t help Watford now.” Okoye, who missed several games for Sparta in January while on duty with the Super Eagles at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, has made 19 league appearances for the Dutch side, conceding 29 goals and keeping only three clean sheets.
