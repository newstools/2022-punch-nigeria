The outgoing Governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano, has urged Anambra youths to make use of the various entrepreneurial skills learnt under the administration to achieve success in their chosen fields. The governor added that Nigeria had reached a point where vocational training remains the only solution to live a responsible life free of depression and other societal challenges. He was represented by the outgoing Commissioner for Youth Empowerment and Creative Economy, Prof. Nkechi Obiekeze, at a one-day sensitisation and training workshop for youth leaders across the 181 communities in the state, mostly from National Youth Council of Nigeria, in Awka, on Tuesday. He advised the youths to be good ambassadors of their parents, community, the incoming administration of Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, and the country at large. He stated that the aim of the one-day event was to refresh their minds towards using various social media platforms for further self-enhancement and development. He also urged the youths to always use social media positively for inherent gains that would help them to become self-reliant in their future pursuits. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
