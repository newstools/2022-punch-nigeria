Celebrity fashion stylist, Toyin Lawani, on Tuesday marked her much-anticipated 40th birthday with dazzling photos of herself. Sharing the pictures on her Instagram page, the fashion mogul informed her fans that she won’t be throwing a party. The self-acclaimed King of Fashion noted that she was going to focus on her family and craft this year, as she promised to throw a party next year. Lawani wrote, “Many people have been calling, expecting a party, but this year is going to be different. I’ll focus on the craft, my family, and celebrate my achievements. “Pray for me. Let’s give and pray. Next year will be a huge turn up. At times, prayer and family is key.” Speaking about her birthday costume, the Tiannah’s Place Empire boss said, “I sketched this look on a live video from my heart while my fans were watching and promised to create it. Here’s the result.” See photos of her birthday costume below:  She continued, “People often tell me I don’t belong in Nigeria because my style is different but what they don’t know is 90 percent of my income comes from the international scene because I stayed true to my passion. “A lot of Nigerian designers focus on African culture and what makes them constant money. I invest my money into staying different.” In her birthday post, the mother-of-three also revealed that she has been in the fashion business for 16 years and had been an entrepreneur for 24 years.
