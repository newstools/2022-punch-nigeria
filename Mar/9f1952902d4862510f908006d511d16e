The Anambra State Police Command on Thursday said it saw no need to arrest wife of outgoing Governor of Anambra State, Ebelechukwu Obiano; and widow of the late Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, Bianca; for breach of public peace. The Command spokesman, Ikenga Tochukwu, made this known in a text response to an inquiry by The PUNCH. According to him, the security agents at the Government House, Agu-Awka, Awka, the state capital, quickly intervened and prevented the brawl between the two personalities from escalating into a full-blown affray and the inauguration of Chukwuma Soludo as the governor of the state continued afterwards. The PUNCH had reported that the two long-feuding women locked horns at the event on Thursday and exchanged slaps before cameras. The development made the outgoing governor, Willie and his wife to abruptly leave the venue of the swearing-in ceremony of Soludo. Activist Deji Adeyanju of Concerned Nigerians had said the two women should be arrested by the police for a breach of public peace, noting that both Bianca and Ebelechukwu set a bad precedent for young ladies present at the event. When contacted on the possibility of their arrest for affray, which is a criminal offence, the PPRO said, “Because of the intervention of security personnel, the quarrel between the two personalities didn’t escalate. Meanwhile, the event continued without any further problems and if there is any need to interface between the two, the Police Command will do so.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
