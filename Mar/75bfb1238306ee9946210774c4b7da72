Asiwaju Musulumi of Yorubaland, Edo and Delta, Chief Tunde Badmus, has urged the Supreme Council for Shari’ah in Nigeria to create a political directorate that would garner support for Muslim ummah interested in vying for political posts. Badmus spoke in Osogbo at the annual National Conference and Pre-Ramadan meeting of the group on Saturday. Badmus, who represented former Lagos State Governor, Senator Bola Tinubu, noted that other religious groups have commenced political participation by creating a directorate that would promote their preferred candidate. He also harped on the need to support Osun State governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, and ensure he was re-elected for another term, being the only Muslim governor in South-West. He said, “Other religious groups have commenced political participation by creating political departments or directorates among themselves to promote their own. “You should create a political wing among yourself, so that it will further gear your participation in politics. It will be a good platform to support your brothers who are vying for political positions.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
