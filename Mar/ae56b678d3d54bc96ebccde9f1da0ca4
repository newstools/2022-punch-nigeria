Leicester City winger Ademola Lookman believes Friday’s World Cup qualification play-off between Nigeria and Ghana is just another game, adding that the players are not under pressure, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. After a poor outing at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, Austin Eguavoen’s men are eyeing a place in Qatar. And to achieve that ambition, they must get past their West African foes in a potentially explosive two-legged tie. For Lookman, who trained with the three-time African champions for the first time on Wednesday, he and his teammates are not moved by the age-long rivalry between both countries. “It’s just another game,” Lookman told journalists in Abuja. “There is a lot of expectations for the game, we don’t have to put any pressure on ourselves but to go out and enjoy ourselves.” Lookman has scored six goals and made five assists in 32 games for the Foxes this season.
