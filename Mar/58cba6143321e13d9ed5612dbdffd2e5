Nigerian businessman, Olakunle Churchill, and his wife, Rosy Meurer on Wednesday celebrated their son, Omoniyi, who just turned one. Churchill, who was previously married to popular Nigerian actress, Tonto Dikeh, took to his Instagram page to share photos of his son. In the birthday post, the excited father noted that his son’s birth brought him joy and gladness. He wrote, “My dear son, in truth your mum brought me happiness and filled a vacuum in my heart. That’s why I named you ‘Omoniyi’ which means ‘a child that brings you honour.’ “Your birth brought me great joy and gladness. You are the patch of green in the desert of my existence and the splitting image of me %100. “Sometimes, my emotions could be controlled whenever I behold your presence and I wonder how lucky I am that I get to be your Dad. “My beloved son, as you celebrate this special day of your life, my prayer for you is that you will excel in all ramifications and that happiness always envelopes your life. “I pray for incomparable wisdom and knowledge of God upon you. “God will engrave your name in the hearts of men because of the wonderful works He will use you to accomplish in His vineyard. Happy first birthday, son.” His wife, Rosy, also shared pictures of their son with the caption, “I knew you were going to be the most special human being to me even before you were born, but this past year has confirmed it. Happy first birthday, son. I love you with all of me.” Tonto married Churchill in 2015 and they welcomed their son, Andre, in 2016. In 2017, the couple divorced and Churchill married the Gambian-born actress, Rosy, in 2019. Rosy and Churchill welcomed Omoniyi together in March, 2021. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
