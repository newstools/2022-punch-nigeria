Three people have been confirmed dead in an accident involving a truck and commercial motorcycle (Okada) in Lagos State. The PUNCH gathered that the unidentified truck was carrying sand when the accident occurred on Tuesday morning around Eleganza Bus Stop in the Lekki area of Lagos. The truck has since been vandalised and set on fire by mob in the area. The accident also caused gridlock in the axis, with many commuters stuck in traffic for several hours. The Lekki Unit Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps, Assistant Corps Commander, Sani Abdullahi, confirmed the casualties to The PUNCH. “My team that went to the scene of the incident confirmed that three people died in the accident,” Sanni said. He, however, blamed the immediate cause of the accident on overspeeding by the truck driver. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
