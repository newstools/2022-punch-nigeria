The Governor of Kano state, Abdullahi Ganduje, has said that Presidents of Niger Republic, Cameroon, Chad and Central Africa, have indicated interest to fully patronise the multi-billion naira project after its inauguration. This was contained in a statement by the Governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Abba Anwar, which was issued to newsmen in Kano on Saturday. According to Anwar, Ganduje made the revelation when he paid an assessment tour to the facility on Friday, where he was taken round by the Chairman of Inland Dry Port, Sahabo Abubakar Bawuro, and the Managing Director, Ahmed Rabi’u. “All the Presidents of Niger Republic, Tchad, Cameroon and Central Africa,have indicated their interest and readiness to be using Kano Dry Port for their imports and exports,” Ganduje said. He said the four presidents of those countries have all agreed to get across to Kano and send their officials to come and discuss with authorities over the modus operandi of the new Dry Port before its inauguration. He called on the would-be-managers of the Port to make sure that they run everything digitally. “We are in a digital world. You should therefore make sure that you comply with the digital demand and operate within the realm of global best practices,” Ganduje asked. He also expressed satisfaction over the level of progress and commitment of both contractors and consultants. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
