The Director of Defence Operations, Major General Jimmy Akor, on Thursday declared that Nigeria is winning the war against insurgency. Akor also called on the media to support the military as it strives to secure and defend the country. The Defence spokesperson spoke during a visit to the Abuja office of The PUNCH newspapers. He said, “I deem it necessary to visit you in your office to pay my courtesies and to solicit your usual support as we carry on with our constitutional roles as enshrined in Section 217 of the constitution. “We will be defending and protecting the outer space, but there are areas where kinetic cannot reach, talking about the minds. “Whatever is sowed in the mind cannot be destroyed by kinetics. So you are the ones that govern that space, the media occupy an enviable place in that sphere. You drive the narratives. “Therefore, I deemed it necessary to come and ask for usual cooperation with the media, especially with the management of The PUNCH. That we own only one country, which is Nigeria and the responsibility to guide the soul of the country, lies in your purview.” “For years, we have been engaged in wars and finally, Nigeria is winning the war against insurgency. Yes, we still have banditry, kidnapping, armed robbery and the likes but we are winning this war. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
