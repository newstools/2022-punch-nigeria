Odion Ighalo scored a goal and had an assist for Al Hilal, who thrashed 10-man Al Nassr 4-0 in a Saudi Arabian League game on Thursday, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The strike took Ighalo’s tally to five goals in six appearances for the club since he joined from Al Shabab in January. Al Hilal have now defeated Al Nassr three times this season, with Ighalo scoring twice against them, the first coming in the Saudi Kings Cup last month, where they came from a goal down to win 2-1. The Nigerian also provided an assist for Salem Al-Dawsari to double Al Hilal’s lead in the 34th minute after Matheus Pereira had shot the visitors into the lead in the 16th minute. Al-Dawsari made it 3-0 before halftime, before things went from bad to worse for the home team as former Everton defender Funes Mori was sent off in the 63rd minute. Ighalo, 32, then completed the rout 15 minutes from time, scoring his side’s fourth goal, before he was replaced six minutes from time for Saleh Al-Shehri. The striker is expected to return to the Eagles squad ahead of their Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifier against Ghana next month. The Eagles will face the West African rivals on March 25 at the Cape Coast Stadium for their first leg fixture, with the second leg billed for the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja on March 29.
