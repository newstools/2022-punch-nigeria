The Deputy Governor of Delta State, Mr. Kingsley Otuaro, has expressed hope of succeeding Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as Delta State Governor in 2023. Otuaro, who stated this after the inauguration of his campaign office in Asaba, said he’s determined to serve Deltans. He said, “I have just opened, dedicated to God an ultra-modern edifice as Campaign Organisation Office in fulfilment of my quest to govern Delta come 2023 general election. “I have been loyal to the Governor and now it is my turn to govern Deltans.
I will champion the principle of common good, and commitment towards unlocking the industrial potentials of Delta by creating boundless opportunities for all. “This principle of common good will be achieved through the promotion of leadership that is devoid of ethnic sentiments, especially in a multi-ethnic society like ours, Delta State. It is Delta for everybody and realizing the Delta of our dreams is my ultimate goal. “The commendable progress which some refers to in some quarters as ‘phenomenal transformation’ Delta State has made in the last six years, is a reflection of the great exemplary, noteworthy and much talked about working relationship I had with my boss and principal, the Governor, His Excellency, Senator Dr. Arthur Ifeanyi Okowa.” Copyright PUNCH.
