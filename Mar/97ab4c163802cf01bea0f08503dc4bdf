Anambra State Governor-elect, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, has presented the Anambra 50-year Development Plan to Governor Willie Obiano. Soludo, who is the Chairman of the Development-Plan drafting committee made the handover at the valedictory session of the Obiano administration held at the International Convention Centre, Awka, on Thursday. He said the document would provide the development trajectory of the state in the next five decades. He said it was a wholly home grown document which had contributions from the cross spectrum of the society, traditional institutions, market women, civil society, youths, making it a document of  the people and that of the government. Soludo pointed out that as of the time the committee was set up, he did not have any idea that he would become governor, but by divine providence, he  was submitting the plan as the governor-elect and would likely be the governor to implement it. He said the Obiano administration had laid a solid foundation for the economic transformation of Anambra, adding that he would continue in that stride as the All Progressives Grand Alliance was a party with a people-oriented manifesto. Receiving the document, Obiano thanked the Soludo-led committee for executing the 30-month task with commitment and altruism. He said he was happy that his administration was able to provide a development plan that would guide the policies of Anambra State government for the next 50 years and thanked the members of his executive for their contributions to the success of his administration.
