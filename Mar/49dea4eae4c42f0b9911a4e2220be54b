The New Nigerian Peoples Party on Friday called on Nigerians to rescue themselves from maladministration and bad governance in 2023 saying, “We can’t continue with old narratives.” The party also called on Nigerians to rescue themselves from insecurity, corruption and nepotism which it said had retarded the growth of the Nigerian nation and her people. The newly appointed Chairman of the NNPP in Ekiti State, Olayinka Dada, stated these in a statement titled, ‘It’s time for ballot revolution.’ Dada said Nigerians were tired of political dealers. He said, “Since the return of democratic rule in 1999, little gains have been recorded despite the huge potentials God has endowed the Nigerian nation with. This is due to bad governance, nepotism, corruption and lack of patriotism, greed and incompetence on the part of those saddled with leadership positions. “Nigerians are no longer comfortable with experimental policies. There must be a road map to ensuring steady growth. So, in 2023, the only option left for Nigerians is to exit non-performing politicians who have held the people hostage. “No amount of old tricks can save the two behemoth parties currently toying with the people. The people of Nigeria have resolved to free themselves in the unfortunate hands of incompetent and corrupt leaders. “The two dominant political parties, All Progressives Congress and Peoples Democratic Party have shown clearly that they lack clear cut ideas on how to build a prosperous nation. The NNPP is here to rescue Nigeria and rebuild the ruins.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
