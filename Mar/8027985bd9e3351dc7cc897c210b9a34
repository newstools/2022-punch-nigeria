The Corporate Affairs Manager, Laterna Ventures Limited, Mr Nnaji Charles, has said early reading will help develop leadership skills in children. Speaking on Thursday at a book reading session organised by the company to commemorate World Book Day, Nnaji, said it was Laterna’s response to foster an endearing love for books among young people so as to mould a generation of leaders who are readers. Nnaji said, “The world book day is a global event that the company uses as an opportunity to encourage the culture of book reading among students. Books are treasures and information is usually hidden in books. The whole essence of reading is so we as a people and a nation can come out better. The development we have seen around the world today revolves around reading. ” Director, Courteville Preparatory School, Lagos, Deji Balogun, who anchored the reading sessions with pupils from Heritage House School, Yaba and Corona School, Victoria island said it was a fantastic initiative to help pupils. “Bringing pupils to reading sessions help them tremendously because children learn by seeing and reading wide,” he said. Laterna Ventures Limited aside from hosting the reading session also made books donation to Redeemers International School, Apapa road, Heritage House School, Yaba and Corona School, Victoria Island.
