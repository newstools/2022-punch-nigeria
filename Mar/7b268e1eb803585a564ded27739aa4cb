A 42-year-old man, Efe Erinoja, has been arrested by the police for allegedly beating his wife to death in Orerokpe, in the Okpe Local Government Area of Delta State. PUNCH Metro gathered that the suspect committed the crime around 6.30am on Wednesday after a misunderstanding with his wife. But the cause of the disagreement could not be immediately ascertained. Community sources hinted that the cry of the 36-year-old woman, identified as Faith Ekpe, attracted neighbours to their house. However, by the time residents arrived at the scene, Faith was dead. Her husband, on realising the gravity of the crime, reportedly fled the community. The matter was reported at the Orerokpe Police Station by a brother of the deceased identified as Monday Ekpe. Our correspondent gathered that when police operatives arrived at the scene, they found Faith’s corpse on the ground with marks of violence on her body. The police then removed the body and deposited it at the Ariemughere mortuary, Orerokpe, pending an autopsy. A security source said the suspect was later tracked and arrested. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DDP Bright Edafe, confirmed the incident, adding that investigations had commenced into the cause of the dispute between the couple. Copyright PUNCH.
