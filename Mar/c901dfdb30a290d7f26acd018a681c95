Stephen Angbulu, Abuja The President, Major General  Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Tuesday, extolled Nigerian women on the occasion of International Women’s Day, March 8, 2022. Buhari observed that women are not where they should be yet in different spheres of endeavour, but believed that they could no longer be deprived for too long, as they have consistently proved that they could hold their own on all fronts, and in all fields. Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, disclosed this in a statement he signed on Tuesday titled,  ‘International Women’s Day: President Buhari salutes womenfolk.’ According to Buhari, the celebration, under the hashtag #BreaktheBias, and the theme: Gender Equality Today for a Sustainable Tomorrow, is an opportunity to reflect on the vital roles women play in society, homes, governance, their professions, and in all walks of life. He applauded the contributions of women to the current administration as Ministers, Special Advisers, Senior Special Assistants, Executive Directors, Executive Secretaries, and many others, noting that they were pulling their weights, and making it impossible for anyone to downplay their essence. Buhari also rejoiced with women and mothers, around whom the tranquillity of homes and society revolves, praying God to grant them peace, joy and satisfaction, as they celebrate today and always.
