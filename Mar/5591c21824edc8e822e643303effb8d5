A director of the National Board of Technical Education was killed during the terrorist attack on Abuja-Kaduna train on Monday night. Confirming his death, a friend close to the deceased, Bashir Usman, tweeted via his official twitter page @senatorbash, “In total submission to the will of almighty Allah, we announce the death of a fellow GSCS alumnus – Abdu Isa Kofar Mata (Gigi) in last night’s attack on Kaduna-Abuja train. “We pray to Allah subhanahu to grant his soul eternal rest.” The PUNCH had reported how terrorists, on Monday night, bombed the Abuja-Kaduna rail tracks and attacked a train filled with passengers. Subsequently, the Nigerian Railway Corporation on Tuesday announced the suspension of train operations along the Abuja-Kaduna route indefinitely following the attacks. The train attack was coming after terrorists, numbering over 200, on Saturday, invaded the Kaduna International Airport located in the Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State, disrupting operation and killing one security personnel of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency. The attack caused panic at the airport and reportedly grounded a Lagos-bound AZMAN aircraft scheduled to take off at 12:30 pm. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
