Men of the Ogun State Police Command have arrested two suspected members of a kidnap syndicate, Jato Bello and Muhammad Suleiman, over their alleged roles in a series of kidnap cases in the state. The suspects were said to have been responsible for the abduction of two siblings last week. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, in a statement on Sunday, said the duo were arrested in the early hours of Saturday following a painstaking technical and intelligence-based investigation embarked upon by the SP Taiwo Opadiran-led anti-kidnapping unit. He noted that the operation led detectives to the suspects’ hideout at the Rounder area of Abeokuta. He said, “Having located the hideout, the anti-kidnapping operatives in conjunction with men of Ilupeju and Lafenwa divisions stormed the place where two of the kidnappers were arrested. “The suspects confessed to kidnapping one Ajibola Salimot Adejoke, whom they traced and abducted in her house at the Oke-Ode area, off Ayetoro Road, Abeokuta, on February 17, 2022. “They also kidnapped one Victoria Oladoyin on February 26, 2022, at the Aboba area of Sodeke Titun, Abeokuta. “Also, on March 8, 2022, the duo and their gang abducted two siblings, Esther Kehinde and David Kehinde at Ayetoro. “Some of the victims have identified the suspects as their abductors.” The PPRO said the state Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, had directed that other members of the syndicate be hunted and brought to book.
