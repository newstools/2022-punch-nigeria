An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday ordered the remand of a 21-year-old man, Paul Aboh, at the Kirikiri Correctional Centre, for allegedly defiling a 15-year-old girl. The defendant, who resides at Ajegunle area of Lagos state, is being tried for conspiracy and defilement. The prosecutor, Insp. Lucky Ihiehie, told the court that the defendant and one other, now at large, committed the offence on January 11, 2022, at Oguntokun Street, Ajegunle area of Lagos state. Ihiehie said that the victim was hawking when the defendant and his accomplice summoned her on the pretext of patronage. He said while the victim was tending to the sales, one of them had gagged her mouth, while the second carried her to the bush in their backyard, before the duo had carnal knowledge of her. Ihiehie added that the victim was abandoned in the bush alive though, following which she went home to complain to her mother, who then reported the incident at the police station. He noted that the offences contravened sections 137 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs O.A. Layinka, upon rejecting the defendant’s plea, had directed the police to revert the case file to the office of the Director of Public Prosecution, for further legal advice. The bench adjourned the case until April 4 for mention. NAN Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
