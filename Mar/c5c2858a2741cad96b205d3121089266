In his statement; “I do music as a means of expressing my inner feelings not to make money; I was already making money before I came into the industry. I’ve taken so many tiger stripes, I’ve lost loved ones, I’ve been to jail, I’ve been homeless, I’ve starved at some point, I’ve hawked in the scorching African sun. I worked so hard for this life but when I got it, I was so depressed and burnt out to celebrate or care. The only way I pour out my feelings is through music” So I basically do music because it makes me feel better. I do not write most of my songs, I just reflect and speak whatever I’m feeling at the moment” Onah Paid also revealed that he is set to release his sophomore album titled “Ugly Struggle” Without any doubt, more interesting pages are set to unfold as the rapper has promised his fans to expect excellence in all his future releases.
