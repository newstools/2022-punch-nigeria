Senator Uba Sani representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District at the National Assembly on Tuesday declared his intention to run for the 2023 governorship on the platform of the All Progressives Congress. Declaring his bid at the state party secretariat in the state capital, Uba said he was out to consolidate on the legacy of his boss and governor of the state, Nasir El-Rufai. While stressing the need to sustain the legacy of the incumbent governor in changing the face of Kaduna State to the envy of all, Uba insisted that the “high standards he has set are both a source of pride and a challenge to his associates and loyalists.” The lawmaker also made an on-the-spot donation of 59 cars in appreciation of the work of the state APC executives and local government chairmen. “I donated 59 cars to them to help facilitate their work and motivate them to prepare for the 2023 electoral battle,” he stated. The event was attended by party bigwigs including the state chairman, deputy chairman, secretary, and other members of the State Executive Committee. Sani noted that under El-Rufa’i, the state had undergone a major revolution, adding that the huge challenge before the state was how to sustain and build on the governor’s legacy of outstanding public service and impact. “The state has been reworked; and this is evidenced in the remarkable milestones the state has recorded in policies, infrastructure, health, education, water resources, agriculture, agribusiness, to list but a few. It is truly new dawn in Kaduna State,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
