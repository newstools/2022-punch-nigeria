The national bodies of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities and the Non-Academic Staff Union of Education and Associated Institutions have declared a two-week warning strike action to commence March 27. This was contained in a letter released on Friday by the Joint Action Committee of NASU and SSANU, signed by SSANU President, Mohammed Ibrahim, and NASU General Secretary, Peters Adeyemi. The letter, titled “Commencement of Two-Week Warning Strike,” directed all its members in universities and inter-university centers to begin the warning strike. JAC argued that the Federal Government had been nonchalant about the demands of the union, and asked its members to strictly adhere to the strike. The JAC letter read in part: “Having waited so long, this is to inform you that the Government has not responded nor reacted to our demands as at this moment. “In view of the nonchalant attitude of the government to our demands, this is to direct our members in all universities and inter-university centres throughout the country to commence a two-week strike by midnight of Sunday, 27 March 2022, in the first instance as earlier conveyed to the federal government in our letter. “Please note that the two-week warning strike should be comprehensive and total as no concession should be given under any guise. “Your strict compliance and adherence to this directive is mandatory for all branches of NASU and SSANU in the universities and inter-university centres.” Copyright PUNCH.
