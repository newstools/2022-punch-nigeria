The Indigenous People of Biafra has accused the Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma of recruiting and sharing smartphones to Imo youths so as to attack its members on the social media platforms. The group said Uzodimma had perfected his plans of using the youths as attack dogs and e-rats to propagate lies and smear campaigns against IPOB, Eastern Security Network and Biafra agitators. In a press statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, on Tuesday, the group said Imo youths should realise that if Uzodimma had any good intentions for them, he won’t.distribute phones for them to attack IPOB. He advised the youths to know that Uzodinma was taking them for granted and should stop being “gullible”. The statement read in part, “Our attention has been drawn to the sharing of smartphones by the Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, to the gullible minds and youths he is recruiting to attack IPOB members on social media platforms. “We blame those he is deceiving with smartphones, material things and cash to oppose those fighting for their freedom. “If Uzodinma had correct intentions for Imo State youths, he wouldn’t have given them phones to attack IPOB; he would have provided industries and companies where the youths will work and produce phones for sale. “We are warning Mazi Pascal Chibuike Okechukwu popularly known as Cubana Chief Priest to steer clear, and not strike a deadly deal with Uzodinma. He should not dare IPOB. “Let him continue his restaurant business and not get deceived by Uzodinma and his APC co-travellers. Anybody who know this man should tell him to retrace his steps and don’t allow Uzodinma to use him to fight innocent people.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
