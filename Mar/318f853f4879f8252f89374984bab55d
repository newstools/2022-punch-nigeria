A man, Yohanna Saidolo, has allegedly sold six children after taking them from their parents under the guise of enrolling them in a missionary school in Adamawa State. PUNCH Metro gathered that the suspect deceived and collected his neighbours’ children in Koma village in the Jada Local Government Area of the state. He reportedly delivered the children to one Madam Lydia of Rhumde-Baru, Jambutu satellite town, Yola, the state capital. One of the victims’ parents, Markus Anthony, said Saidolo promised to enrol the children in a missionary school in Yola. “We couldn’t hear from our kids, and they could not come home for any holiday; not even during Christmas,” Anthony lamented. The parents were said to have reported the matter to the police. Upon his arrest, Saidolo allegedly confessed to selling off the children. “I actually delivered eight children to Madam Lydia, including two of my children,” Saidolo said. The defendant was on Wednesday arraigned before a Chief Magistrate’s Court. The police prosecutor, Ibrahim Aliyu, said the offences were contrary to sections 257 and 259 of the Penal Code Law, 2018. The magistrate, Alheri Ishaku, ordered his remand in a custodial centre. Ishaku also granted the prosecution’s request to transfer the case file to the Directorate of Public Prosecutions for legal advice. As of now, the whereabouts of the children remains unknown, as the police continue with their investigation. The case was adjourned till March 25, 2022.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
