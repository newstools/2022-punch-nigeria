Nigerian Women have thronged the National Assembly in their numbers to express their disdain on the rejection of women-related bills at the plenary session on Tuesday. For example, a bill seeking to give at least ten slots to women as ministers and commissioners in the federal and state governments failed at the upper legislative chamber. A total of 88 senators registered to vote. 44 senators voted yes, while 43 voted no, and 1 abstained. The bill which was meant to guarantee the inclusivity of women in governance failed as it could not garner 73 votes needed for it to be passed. The women said they were disappointed despite having assurances from the leadership of the house on the bills. The National Assembly gate was shut as result. The women said gender equality is a development issue and not about women. They are calling on lawmakers to revisit the rejected bills. Details later… Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
