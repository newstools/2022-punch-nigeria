A Magistrate’s Court sitting in Akure, Ondo State, has remanded a leader of the Oodua People’s Congress, Temitope Alo, in a custodial centre for allegedly disrupting the religious programme of a mosque. Alo and a member of his gang allegedly flogged the mosque traffic controller, Akeem Aminu, and inflicted injuries on him with a cutlass. The defendant was said to have been arrested by the police and arraigned on five counts bordering on assault and conduct likely to cause breach of public peace. The police prosecutor, Inspector Abdulateef Suliaman, said the defendant and others at large committed the offence around 2.30pm on March 13, 2022, at the Central Mosque, Oja-Oba, Akure. The prosecutor also told the court that the victim, who was the mosque traffic controller, sustained serious injuries and was in a critical condition at the police clinic. He added that the conduct caused a breach of peace in the town and made the worshippers run helter-skelter for their lives. Suliaman said, “The offences contravene sections 519, 252, 351, 249(d), 205(2), and 206 of the Criminal Code, Cap. 37, Vol. 1, Laws of Ondo State, 2016.” The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges preferred against him. His lawyer, Femi Adetoye, applied for his bail. The magistrate, N.K Aladejana, ordered the remand of the defendant in a custodial centre and adjourned the case till March 24, 2022, for hearing.
