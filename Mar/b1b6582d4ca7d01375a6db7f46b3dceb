A newly-elected member of the Cross River State House of Assembly, Ekeng Edet, has been sworn in. Edet, who was elected on February 26 to represent the Akpabuyo State Constituency, was sworn in on Tuesday at the state House of Assembly by the Speaker, Eteng Williams, during the sitting of the house. After the oath of office was administered on Edet, the speaker told him that the House Rules would be given to get him acquainted with the way things are done. Speaking after he was sworn in, Edet said, “I can give effective representation to the people of Akpabuyo.” He said it doesn’t matter that he belonged to a minority party in the house, the Peoples Democratic Party, adding that what matters is that they were all elected to serve the interest of the people of Cross River State. Edet fills the vacuum created by the demise of the former member representing Akpabuyo State Constituency, Elizabeth Ironbar, last year. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
