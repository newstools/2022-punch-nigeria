The Managing Director of News Agency of Nigeria, Mr Buki Ponle, has said more women inclusion in government and political offices is pivotal to the country’s development. Ponle said this on Friday in Abuja during a courtesy visit by the Founder and CEO of Albinism Foundation Africa, Mr. Jake Epelle. This follows the rejection of the pro-equality bills by the National Assembly. Expressing his convictions, the NAN MD said, “I am not a politician, but I will fight for women and children wherever I am. “I have a wife, I have daughters and relations who are women. I also have women who have made it in life. “Wherever we find ourselves on the gender scale, we must prove our mettle, and I commend Nigerian women for doing so well in many areas of endeavour, not only in politics, but in businesses. “I give kudos to women and I will always respect them; now we can trust our women with money, many of them are managing directors and Chief Executive Offices.” Ponle expressed satisfaction with Epelle’s visit and his unstinting contribution in the management of the (albinism) foundation both in Nigeria and diaspora. He also promised that the agency would continue to do its best in extending all necessary support and aid for the Abinism Foundation.
