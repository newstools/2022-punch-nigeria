The Commissioner of Police, Abubakar Lawal, gave the order in a statement on Saturday morning, titled, ‘Alleged viral video clip of police operatives physically assaulting citizens at Agbani area of Nkanu West LGA Enugu: CP condemns act, orders thorough investigation and sanction of erring operatives’.
