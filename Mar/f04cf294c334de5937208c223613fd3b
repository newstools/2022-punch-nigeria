Kwara State Government has concluded arrangements to enroll out-of-school children in schools across the state to secure their future. The state Commissioner for Education and Human Capital Development, Mrs Sa’adatu Modibbo-Kawu stated this in Ilorin. She said the process would enable the state government to remove children of school age from the streets and reduce the number of out-of-school children to the barest minimum. She explained that a Kwara learns programme had been introduced to turn around the education of children in public schools and make it attractive. The Commissioner noted that parents in communities identified with a large number of out-of-school children would be carried along in designing methods of education that would suit their needs. She maintained that the state government had already renovated over 600 schools across the state to make teaching and learning conducive. Modibbo-Kawu commended the state governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq for paying the counterpart fund of the Universal Basic Education Commission. “The governor has provided learning and teaching aids for both students and teachers to ensure conducive atmosphere within the school environment.” Copyright PUNCH.
