The International Federation of Women Lawyers said it has successfully foiled an attempt to traffic and sell a set of twins at the Ndoki axis of old Port Harcourt town. FIDA’s chairperson in the state, Adata Bio-Briggs, who disclosed this in Port Harcourt, said the rescue followed a complaint by the mother that a prophetess of the church where she was delivered of the twin babies denied her access to her children. Bio-Briggs also said the woman alleged that the prophetess and the father of the twins might have worked in connivance, lamented that the mother was not allowed to breastfeed the babies. “The distressed mother walked in and complained that she gave birth in a church and they had denied her access to her children, that in the past 24 hours, they didn’t allow her to breastfeed the children, that they (the church) had agreed with the father of the children to take the children to Bayelsa,” she said.
