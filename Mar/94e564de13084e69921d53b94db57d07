He cautioned residents and herders in communities within the shooting range area not to panic when they see troops movements and hear sound of weapons, adding that adequate protection measures had been put in place for them. The statement read, “As part of routine training activities in the Nigerian Army annual programme of events, shooting exercises are usually conducted across formations and units to ensure proficiency and productivity amongst personnel. “Similar exercise which is scheduled to hold on Friday, March 18, 2022, will involve firing of live ammunition.
