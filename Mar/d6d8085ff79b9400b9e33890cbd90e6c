UFC welterweight champion, Kamaru Usman, says he prepared to sniff out any doubts in Colby Covington in a potential third fight. Usman defeated Covington at UFC 268 last November for a second time — a fight the Nigerian won by a close unanimous decision. “I asked the audience what they thought, and they thought Colby had a chance,” Usman said in an interview at T-Mobile Arena. “Absolutely. The clear No. 1 contender will emerge. “It always does. But right now, the No. 1 contender is Leon Edwards. I’ll take care of him in July. The 34-year-old also revealed he’s targeting a title defense against Leon Edwards in July, provided his hand recovers from surgery. After Edwards, he is serious about crossing over into boxing and challenging the sport’s pound-for-pound top fighter, Canelo Alvarez. “I’m telling everybody, I will go out there and stop Canelo. “I have to be the one to believe it, because I have to be the one to step in there. It doesn’t matter what everybody says.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
