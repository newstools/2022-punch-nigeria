THERE was palpable tension in Onitsha, Obosi, Nnewi, Idemili and environs on Monday as unknown gunmen threatened to strictly enforce the Monday sit-at-home. The unknown gunmen, on Monday, sent letters to the various communities, warning them of the dangers of disobeying the sit-at-home order. This is despite the call for a dialogue and ceasefire by the state governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, during his inaugural address on Thursday. The letter read, “The sit-at-home every Monday must be respected accordingly. Any group of persons seen to be violating it, will be severely dealt with, whoever he or she may be. “It has also come to our knowledge that motorists, especially tricycle operators have lately been defying the order, they should be warned that we are now out for work on Mondays and anybody seen flaunting the order will have himself to blame. “Also companies found operating on Mondays will be shut down. Be warned!” The letters, which were pasted at the various strategic locations, in the various communities, on Monday, caused panic as people, who had wanted to go about their normal business, thinking the arrival of a new government had changed the position of things, ran back to their houses.
