Award-winning Nigerian artiste, David Adeleke, popularly known as Davido has defended his support for his uncle, Senator Ademola Adeleke, an Osun State governorship aspirant. The singer noted that he was supporting the senator because he(Davido) was fighting for his state and for his ‘blood’. This was in response to a Twitter troll who knocked Senator Adeleke for contesting in the Osun governorship election. The tweep was responding to Davido’s tweet, where the singer complained about the country. “Naija don cast fully,” Davido tweeted on Wednesday. In response, @lexxy4real said, “Same naija wey your uncle dey contest election? Why can’t he contest as the governor of Atlanta since he is a citizen there? Why Naija wey don cast?” Replying to the user, Davido said, “Bro, I’m giving out money on Friday. Join in and win something instead of fighting for people who don’t give a f*ck about you! “I’m fighting for my state and my blood! You’re fighting for someone who doesn’t care about you and will probably even regard me before you.” This comes shortly after the singer announced that he was donating N20m to 20 business owners. Davido, who had earlier lamented the cost of clearing his Lamborghini from the port, also called for prayers for the country. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
