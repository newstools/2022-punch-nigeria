There was panic on Monday at Umuebo in Umuezeala ward popular known as Abba Branch, Ehime Mbano Local Government Area of Imo state, when a combined team of security operatives razed house where a suspected dealer in Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, known as Mkpuru mmiri, lived. A village source told our correspondent that the security operatives set the building on fire and ensured that it was completely burnt down before they left. A villager said, “at first, people thought the bad boys were on a rampage, little was it known that it was security operatives that were in action. The house is a tenant house. The suspect who is a Mkpurumiri lives there with other tenants but the saddening thing is that the property of otter tenants was burnt. Not a single item was taken out of the house.” The source said that the fear of the residents was compounded as Monday was also a sit-at-home day. He said, “as I speak to you, everybody is indoors. Fear is in the air. Everybody is being careful. Nobody wants to be caught in the web. We are calling on God to restore normalcy in our land.” When contacted, the spokesperson for the police in the state, Micheal Abattam, promised to make an inquiry and get back to journalists. He was yet to do so as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
