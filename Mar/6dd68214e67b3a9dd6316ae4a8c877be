Israeli Prime Minister, Naftali Bennett, has tested positive for COVID-19, barely 24 hours after his meeting with the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken in Jerusalem. The PM’s office disclosed this to AFP journalists on Monday. Bennett had met with Blinken in Jerusalem on Sunday during talks of a “historic summit” of Israeli and Arab diplomats. It was reported that the prime minister was not wearing a face mask during the joint news conference with Blinken on Sunday. A statement from his office said on Monday that he is ”feeling well and will continue his schedule as planned from his home”. Earlier, Bennett visited the Northern Israeli city of Hadera after gunmen shot dead two police officers in an attack claimed by the jihadist Islamic State group. Police said the two gunmen – Israeli Arabs identified by Israeli intelligence as local IS operatives were killed by counterterrorism officers who happened to be nearby. However, pictures published by Israeli media after his visit to Hadera, during which he was also briefed by the police on the attack, showed Bennett wearing a face mask. Bennett’s office said that on Monday the prime minister “will hold a situation assessment following the attack that took place last night with” the ministers of defence, public security, the army’s chief of staff and other officials.
