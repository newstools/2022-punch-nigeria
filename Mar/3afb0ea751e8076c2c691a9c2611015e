Former President Olusegun Obasanjo, on Saturday, refuted the claim that he had endorsed the South-East to produce the President in 2023. Obasanjo’s rebuttal was in reaction to an online report quoting him to have backed the region to produce the next President. The report stated that Obasanjo made the endorsement while receiving Mao Ohuabunwa, a presidential aspirant, in Abeokuta, Ogun State, on Thursday. According to the report, the former President stated that South easterners could bring a lot to the table if elected. But in his reaction, Obasanjo accused Ohuabunwa as being the brain behind the report, saying the aspirant puts words into his (ex-President’s) mouth. Obasanjo made the denial through his media Aide, Kehinde Akinyemi, in a statement made available to journalists in Abeokuta. The statement read in part, “If that was the way the presidential aspirant wanted to approach his ambition, such was the wrong way. “He came here and the former President received him as a gentleman and in the spirit of his 85th birthday celebrations, only for him (Ohuabunwa) to go and put words into his (Obasanjo’s) mouth. Baba is not that sort of a man and if that is the way he (Ohuabunwa) wants to fulfil his ambition that is the wrong way.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
