The Senior Special Assistant to Ekiti State Governor on Electoral Matters, Mr Olaiya Kupolati, has resigned his position and defected to the Social Democratic Party. He attributed the decision to his conviction that former governor Segun Oni is the best man in the June 18 Ekiti governorship election. The SSA, in a letter dated March 23, 2022, and addressed to the Secretary to the State Government, stated, “I, Kupolati Olaiya, the Senior Special Assistant on Electoral Matters, hereby resign my position with effect from 30th March 2022. I appreciate Mr Governor for giving me the opportunity to serve the good people of Ekiti State”. Kupolati in a chat with journalists in Ado Ekiti on Thursday, stated that his resignation was in tandem with the stipulation of the new Electoral Act that every appointee seeking political office should resign accordingly, adding that he intended to contest for the Ilejemeje state constituency seat in the 2023 House of Assembly elections on the SDP platform.
