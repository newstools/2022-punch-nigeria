Nigerian singer, David Adeleke, popularly known as Davido, has written to the United Kingdom Embassy to ensure that his aide, Israel DMW, was granted a visa. The singer, who has been billed to headline a concert at the 02 Arena, had earlier welcomed his family members and close associates to London ahead of the Saturday event. Announcing his arrival for the concert, Israel narrated how Davido wrote to the UK Embassy to help him fast track his visa, so he could attend the show. Expressing joy that he was “now international”, Israel appreciated his principal for ensuring that he attended the event. Sharing pictures of his arrival on his verified Instagram page on Friday, Israel revealed that his visa was “fully granted immediately” after Davido’s intervention. “God bless you, my boss. You personally wrote and signed to UK embassy, and my visa was fully granted immediately,” Isreal wrote in the caption. Davido had on Thursday welcomed his baby mama, Chioma Rowland, and their son, Ifeanyi, at the London airport ahead of the show. The singer also announced that he sold out all the tickets for the show, an indication that the 20,000-capacity arena would be fully occupied by fans. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
