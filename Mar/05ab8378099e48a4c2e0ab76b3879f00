The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has asked the Ministries of Environment, Water Resources, Agriculture and Rural Development, and Power to pool resources and intelligence together to combat desertification in the country According to the News Agency of Nigeria, the Special Adviser to the President, Mr Femi Adesina, said Buhari gave the directive in Nairobi after a meeting with the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, Mr Ibrahim Thiaw. Buhari, who was attending a special session of the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP@50), said the 11 states prone to drought and desert encroachment should join in the collaboration on the platform of the Northern Governors Forum. The president equally directed full cooperation between Nigeria and UNCCD in the prelude to the forthcoming meeting to combat desertification billed for Cote D’Ivoire in May. In his remarks, Thiaw said apart from the meeting in Cote D’Ivoire, a climate change conference would hold in Egypt later in the year, noting that “the Conference of the Parties would be coming back to Africa after 11 years.’’ On desertification, he said Africa lost about 60 per cent of its arable land in the past 50 years, leading to a challenge of feeding the people. He said, “Land degradation is about food, peace and security. And land restoration provides multiple solutions. It brings carbon back to the soil when you cultivate the land.  Copyright PUNCH.
