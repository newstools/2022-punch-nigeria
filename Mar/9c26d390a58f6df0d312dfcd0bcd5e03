The National Union of Banks, Insurance, and Financial Institutions Employees has confirmed the re-election of Anthony Abakpa as its National President. The re-election exercise was held during the quadrennial delegates’ conference of the association. Speaking at the event, Abakpa stated that his interim team had managed to steer the association towards the path of progress after enduring a difficult time occasioned by various challenges. He said, “In the course of the tenure of this interim administration, we have had to contend with many challenges that we were able to navigate through successfully. “Among the challenges was the attempt by the National Assembly to designate our great union as an essential services sector, the implication of which our union would be stripped of its legitimate rights of picking and strike, thus rendering us as toothless bulldogs that could only bark without a bite.” After the voting exercise, Chinedu Ogbonna emerged as the deputy national president of the union; Francis Ndife as deputy national president; Ibrahim Saidu as vice president; James Yaro as vice president; Onyekachi Emeka as national treasurer; Femi Makindipe as national trustee; Nkiru Ejim as national trustee; Abubakar Gyang as national auditor; Thomas Omoaka as national Auditor; and Stella Adu as female representative.
