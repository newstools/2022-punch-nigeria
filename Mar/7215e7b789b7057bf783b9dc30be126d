An aspirant for the post of National Women Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Dr Betta Edu, has debunked reports that she failed to resign as the Commissioner for Health in Cross River State before contesting for the party’s position. She said this ahead of the Unity list expected to be released ahead of the APC national convention to be held on Saturday. She said this in a statement on Friday by her media office signed by Esther Bepeh, titled, ‘South-South Unity list endorsed National Women Leader, Betta Edu, resigned appointment, says media office’. The statement noted that “the issue of disqualification does not arise in any case because Edu as a democrat resigned her appointment before aspiring for the position of the National Women Leader.” Section 84 (12) of the amended Electoral Act 2021 stated that “no political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the Convention or Congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.”
