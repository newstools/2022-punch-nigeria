Nollywood star, Tonto Dikeh, on Thursday, alleged that she had been receiving death threats since 2020 concerning her affiliation with a perfume brand. In an Instagram post, the actress noted that she had also been a victim of the brand, as she announced the end of brand ambassadorship. The mother-of-one also apologised to those who have experienced losses as a result of their investment in the company. Sharing a picture of the brand owner, she wrote, “This is a disclaimer and a long overdue apology to all the victims of Wale Jana and his brand. “I would like to state that I, King Tonto Dikeh, have no affiliation with Wale Jana or his perfume brand any longer. “I have since 2020 been receiving death threats, complaints and calls about various investments. I am also a victim but I will bring my pride down and say I am sorry for all that has gone wrong. “One thing you all can’t deny is how I decently/gracefully handle your calls and pacified you to have patience. “I am, however, very aware that over 99.9 percent of their/his investors came from me being their brand ambassador and I am so sorry for this. “When we get into a contract with a brand, I normally do my background checks properly but I believe I failed here. I sincerely wish everyone well and hope you all recover from your losses! “Again, I am indeed sorry. I will work tirelessly with the right authorities to ensure you all get justice( money back).” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
