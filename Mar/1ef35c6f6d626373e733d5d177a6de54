Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, has asked all political appointees and other public servants nursing political ambitions to resign on or before March 31, 2022, ahead of the 2023 general elections. This was according to a circular by the Secretary to the State Government, Balarabe Abbas which was sighted by our correspondent on Wednesday. The circular reminded those concerned about the new electoral which required appointees to resign their appointments as conditions to contest the forthcoming election. According to the circular which was addressed to Senior Special Assistant, Senior Advisers, and other top government functionaries, affected officials must strictly comply with the directive. It noted that the act provides that officers aspiring to contest political offices should resign 30 days before the party’s primary elections. “To this end, in compliance with the provision, all political appointees, and other public servants serving in the state government aspiring for political offices should submit their resignation letters to the SSG on or before 31st, March 2022,” it said. Recall that Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act recently signed into law by the President, Major-General Muhammadu Buhari,(retd) prevents political office holders in the country from contesting for election from the party primary level without resigning.
