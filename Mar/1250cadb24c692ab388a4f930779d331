Three teenagers identified as David Emmanuel, 19; Chibuike Ogbona, 16; and Jesse Izedi, 16, living in Lagos, have been paraded by the Osun State Police Command for fraudulently obtaining N351, 100 from a victim. The state Commissioner of Police, Wale Olokode, who paraded the suspects at the command headquarters in Osogbo, said the suspects fraudulently withdrew the amount from a Union Bank’s account belonging to a woman. He said upon receipt of a complaint, police operatives, during investigation, were able to identify the first suspect, David, before others were also known. Olokode said, “On February 11, 2022, the complainant reported that N351,100 was fraudulently withdrawn from her Union Bank’s account to a bank account number 100047892 which was later traced to the first suspect, second and third suspects. “The police immediately put investigative mechanism in place and the three suspects were subsequently arrested at Ojo area, Lagos State. “The suspects confessed to the crime and they will be charged to court after the completion of investigation.”  Copyright PUNCH.
