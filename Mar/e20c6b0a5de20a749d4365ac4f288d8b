 Super Eagles duo Taiwo Awoniyi and Emmanuel Dennis are leading Ballon d’Or winners Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in the race for the 2021/22 Golden Shoe award, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The duo has won the award 10 times between them. Messi has won the Golden Shoe award a record six times in 2009–10, 2011–12, 2012–13, 2016–17, 2017–18 and 2018–19 while Ronaldo was crowned the winner on four occasions 2007–08, 2010–11, 2013–14 and in 2014–15 he shared the award with Luis Suarez. Despite being the recipient of the award in the past, the duo trail Awoniyi and Dennis in this season’s race for the Golden Shoe award. Awoniyi has scored 10 goals for Union Berlin in the Bundesliga this season, while Dennis has bagged nine goals and provided five assists for Premier League relegation battlers Watford. Messi, who has struggled to impressed this season, has notched only two goals in 16 Ligue 1 games for Paris Saint Germain, though the Argentine has 11 assists so far. Ronaldo on his part has scored nine goals but with fewer assists than the Nigerian pair. Last season’s winner, Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski, who scored a monumental 41 goals last season, currently leads the race for the award for a second consecutive season. The Polish striker has scored 28 goals in 24 games this term, but will have to fend off competition from the likes of Dusan Vlahovic, Patrik Schick,  Karim Benzema, Ciro Immobile, Mohamed Salah and Erling Haaland to earn the honour of being the continent’s top scorer. Vlahovic, who recently joined Juventus, has scored 21 Serie A goals this season for both Fiorentina and Juventus, just as Schick has for Bayer Leverkusen. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
