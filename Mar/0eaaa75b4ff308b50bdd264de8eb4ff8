In this episode of So This Happened, we reviewed the terror attack on Abuja-Kaduna train on Monday. It was learnt that the bandits bombed the tracks which caused the train to derail and upon stoppage of the train, the assailants began to shoot indiscriminately. We also reviewed the arrest of a man, Martins and his friends, who attended a church in Lagos State but were accused by the pastor of not being members of the church but thieves. Lastly, Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban has directed all government employees to wear a beard and adhere to a particular dress code or risk being fired. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
