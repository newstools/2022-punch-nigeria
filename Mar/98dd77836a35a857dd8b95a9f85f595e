The Federal Capital Territory Administration has commenced a process to stop rickety vehicles from plying roads in the nation’s capital. This is as the administration gave motorcyclists plying the highways two weeks ultimatum to stay off. Speaking at a stakeholder’s meeting on Friday, the Director, Directorate of Road Traffic Services, Dr Abdulateef Bello said apart from causing environmental hazards,  those vehicles are unbefitting of the status of the nation’s capital. He said, “FCT is the pride of Nigeria, as a country and we want to make sure that we create a very good impression. So anything that will have negative value on the  aesthetics of the city should be taken away, that’s the reason why we have to address this, especially  the heavy smoking cars and other cars  capable of causing environmental hazards. They are not fit to be on our roads and would be rid of them from the territory.” Bello stated that the  two weeks  ultimatum was arrived after meeting with the leaders of the operators. He added that after the ultimatum enforcement would commence, warning that any  motorcyclist seized would be crushed. Bello said, ” Having engaged with the leadership of the Okada group, we just hope that they will comply with the instructions of the restrictions that they should not ply the highway. “We will give them two weeks while we continue to carry out the exercise of enforcement and monitoring and then removal . Of those we see on the highway, after two weeks if they don’t comply, then we will start thinking of how to push the decision to ban”. “We will be crushing all impounded motorcycles, we have crushed over 2000 of them already, and we will continue to crush them to serve as a detriment”.
