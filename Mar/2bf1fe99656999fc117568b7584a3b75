Sixty-six years old Willie Obiano spent his first night as former Governor of Anambra State in the custody of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, The PUNCH can confirm. EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, confirmed the development in a telephone chat with our correspondent on Friday morning. He, however, did not state how long the anti-graft agency would detain the All Progressives Grand Alliance chieftain. Uwujaren did not also state whether the ex-governor was arrested alongside his wife, Ebelechukwu. “Obiano was arrested and he is still in our custody,” the EFCC official said, promising to provide the anti-graft agency’s next line of action in the coming days. The PUNCH had reported that EFCC operatives picked up Obiano at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, around 08:30pm. The ex-governor, who had been on the watch list of the EFCC since November 15, 2021, was arrested while trying to board a flight to the United States. Obiano was arrested just at the expiration of his immunity, barely hours after handing over to his successor, Charles Soludo, in Awka, the Anambra State capital. The arrest occurred hours after his wife was reportedly slapped by the widow of the late Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, Bianca at the inauguration of Soludo as the governor of the state. It was learnt that Obiano was arrested for allegedly mismanaging over N17bn Paris Club refund and security vote. He is also being probed over some suspicious projects, including the Umueri International Airport project whose cost was believed to be inflated. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
