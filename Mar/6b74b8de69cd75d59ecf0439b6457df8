THE newly completed electricity transmission substation in Lafia, Nasarawa State, is to serve about one million households in the state and neighbouring areas, the Niger Delta Power Holding Company has said. According to the power firm, the substation was made up of six feeders, adding that it comprised 2X150MVA and 2x60MVA 330/132/33KV plants. The Managing Director, NDPHC, Chiedu Ugbo, who disclosed this in Lafia, stated that before the establishment of the substation, Lafia was served by a single 70km distribution line from Akwanga. Ugbo explained that the line had so much connections on the way and as a result of this, the power that eventually got to Lafia was very dim. “So there was no useful electricity in Lafia and its environs,” the NDPHC boss stated in a statement issued in Abuja by the firm. He added, “We expect the project to improve the well-being of residents of Lafia and Nasarawa State and improve economic activities, as well as the reation of jobs. “Also, because of the big nature of the project, we expect it to become the transmission hub in the country. TCN is working on the connection. A 330KV connection from here to Abuja, to back feed Abuja.” Ugbo said the NDPHC constructed the Lafia substation to step down electricity from the high voltage transmission line to a lower voltage level where the distribution company could draw electricity and serve power users in the region.
