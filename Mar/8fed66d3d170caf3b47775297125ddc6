Nollywood actress on Thursday opened up about her battle with endometriosis, a disorder where tissue appears outside a woman’s uterus. In an Instagram post, the actress noted that the aient caused her “vicious pain” for more than 20 years. Balogun revealed that she began to lose her hair as a result of treatment. She wrote, “This time last year, I was reminded that it was Endometriosis Awareness month. After a year I wasn’t ready to share. Stage 4 Endometriosis, they said. “I took this picture just after I noticed I was losing my hair as a result of treatment. It took a lot not to burst into tears because I love my hair! To see batches of it in my hands stung. It still does but we’re gonna get it back. “I was really happy to finally have an accurate diagnosis because it meant I finally knew the root of twenty something years of excruciating pain. “I liken the pain to someone taking a barbed wire to your insides and twisting it continuously for days on end. It’s not mere period cramps, aches or discomfort. It’s a vicious pain!” Explaining the ailment, Balogun said, “Endometriosis affects one in 10 women. It’s an unseen chronic condition that is often misdiagnosed. It doesn’t get enough attention or research. “Endometriosis is when tissue lining the uterus grows outside of it. Endo lesions can form everywhere from the lungs, intestines, ovaries, Fallopian tubes and more.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
