Amid the growing concern over ritual killings in the country, the Ogun Alternate Medicine Board on Friday said it would set up a task force to expose the identities of uncertified traditionalists rendering unlawful services to criminals. The chairman of the board, Mr Balogun Olaleye, who stated this at a strategic meeting with members of staff and stakeholders in Abeokuta, decried the growing rate of ritual killings, kidnapping and cultism in the country. “I am saying that the use of human beings or human parts for ritual is not in our value system and we will not accept such. The board is strategic in curtailing the evil acts and we are deploying all means to track down the unscrupulous traditionalists, whom the people believe are the ones rendering the evil services,” Olaleye was quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria as saying. He further said some of the measures that could be adopted to end the menace included the re-orientation of alternative medicine practitioners, traditionalists and herbalists as well as strengthening the synergy with security agencies on enforcement. According to him, findings had shown that the heinous acts were perpetrated mostly by youths due to moral decadence in society and the “get-rich-quick syndrome”. Olaleye said the board would ensure that certified practitioners in the state abide by the operational rules and guidelines of the practice for human wellness. Also speaking, a member of the board, Alhaji Ajisope Aroyewun, noted that 70 per cent of the culprits arrested and interrogated by the police had no connection with certified herbalists or traditionalists.
