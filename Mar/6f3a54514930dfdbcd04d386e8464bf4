The Nigeria Police Force, on Tuesday, issued a security advisory to the public on transportation, in its statutory mandate to protect lives and property, and against the spate of insecurity across the country. Spokesman for the police, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, disclosed this in a short video clip posted on the Force’s official Facebook page, on Tuesday, March 15, 2022. Below is the summary of the security tips for both commuters and transport workers. 1. Don’t patronise branded, unapproved commercial vehicles. 2. Take note of the number plates of the vehicle you’re boarding and share same with friends or relatives, in case things go south on the way. 3. Be wary of hitching a ride with strangers. Free rides, aka “lift” can be dangerous. 4. Don’t be in haste to board vehicles, take time to assess the state of the vehicle and passengers aboard, especially at nocturnal hours. 5. Board a transport from registered/approved motor parks/garages. 6. Board a transport and alight at designated bus stops. 7. Correlate the number plate of Uber transport booked online to the one that comes to pick you: cancel the order immediately you notice a discrepancy. Safety is a precaution you can’t afford to gamble in life. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
