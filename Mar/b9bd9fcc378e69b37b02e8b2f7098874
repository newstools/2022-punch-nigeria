Nollywood veteran, Kate Henshaw, on Wednesday lamented the worsening scarcity of petrol products in the country. The actress shared a video on her Instagram page, where she called on Nigerians to take actions concerning the future leaders of the country. This was as she faulted the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) for jetting out of the country amid fuel scarcity crisis. The PUNCH had earlier reported that Buhari on Tuesday, departed Abuja for Nairobi, Kenya, where he was billed to participate in the 50th anniversary of the United Nations Environmental Programme scheduled for Thursday and Friday. He will, thereafter, proceed to London, United Kingdom, for routine medical checks that will last for a maximum of two weeks. The actress expressed her displeasure concerning Buhari’s travel, noting that since the president doubled as the Petroleum Minister of the country, he would have done better. She said, “With all due respect, we have Mr President who doubles as the Petroleum Minister. He has jetted out to go and look after himself. Nobody cares.” Watch video below:  Copyright PUNCH.
