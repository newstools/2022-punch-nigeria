The Benin Zonal Command of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons has said it rescued 105 victims of human trafficking in various operations in 2021. The Zonal Commander, NAPTIP, Nduka Nwannwenne, said this when he spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria in Benin on Wednesday. Nwachukwu said that some of the rescued victims have already been reunited with their families, while some have been empowered with skills to engage in businesses. He said the Director-General of NAPTIP, Dr Fatima Waziri-Azi, was focused on ensuring that all rescued victims were empowered to ensure self-reliance. The Zonal Commander said that 134 cases of human trafficking were received by the command in the period under review. Nwannwenne said that 75 suspected traffickers were arrested, while three human traffickers were convicted by law courts during the period, adding, however, that 65 cases were still pending in law courts. He said that the blue bus campaign concept aimed at raising awareness on the dangers of human trafficking had been effective in the zone. “The blue bus concept is a one-stop-shop for issues of human trafficking. “With the blue bus initiative which is been done with the International Organisation on Migration, there has been AN increase in reported cases of human trafficking,” he said.
