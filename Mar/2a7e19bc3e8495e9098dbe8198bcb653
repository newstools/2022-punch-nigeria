The Cape Coast Stadium, venue of Ghana’s first leg Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifying play-off tie against Nigeria on March 25 is currently in bad shape and undergoing rehabilitation, just 15 days to the crucial World Cup qualifier, The PUNCH has learnt. The stadium’s football pitch was used as venue for the government’s celebration of the country’s 65th independence anniversary on March 6, but the pitch is yet to wear a new look after it was badly damaged during the celebrations. Pictures on social media showed holes on the pitch, while others showed that work was still ongoing. According to reports in Ghana, the condition of the pitch might warrant the game to be moved to another venue in either Accra or Kumasi. Ghana Football Association had previously asked the Confederation of African Football to allow them move the game to another stadium. Meanwhile, Ghanaian journalist, Asante Forkuo, who visited the stadium on Wednesday tweeted, “This is the state of Cape Coast Stadium today after Sunday’s Independence Anniversary. I am sure it will be ready for the Ghana versus Nigeria World Cup Qualifier.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
