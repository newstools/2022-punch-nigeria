In commemoration of the World Tuberculosis Day, which was celebrated on Thursday, the Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, said Nigeria reported no fewer than 207,000 cases of tuberculosis in 2021, with 12,977 cases affecting children. The minister also said only 28 out of the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory had treatment centres for the management of drug-resistant tuberculosis. The WTD, which is celebrated globally on March 24, is designed by the United Nations to build public awareness about the global tuberculosis epidemic and efforts to eliminate the disease. According to the World Health Organisation, the disease remains one of the top 10 causes of deaths worldwide. Speaking at an event organised by the Federal Ministry of Health to mark the day, Ehanire stated the strategies that had been put in place by the Federal Government to eliminate the disease. He stated, “Our efforts in the area of TB/HIV collaboration have yielded good results, with the annual proportion of TB patients tested for HIV consistently over 94 per cent in the last six years. Similarly, the proportion of TB patients co-infected with HIV has dropped from 18 per cent in 2014 to six per cent in 2021. This is consistent with the report of the 2018 National HIV/AIDS Impact Indicator Survey. “Our annual TB notification has steadily increased from 100,433 in 2016 to more than 207,000 TB cases in 2021, the highest ever notification and a 45 per cent increase from the 2020 notification. “A key challenge to our control effort has been low notification of child TB cases, mainly due to capacity gaps among healthcare workers in diagnosing TB in childhood. Although we notified our highest number of child TB cases of 12,977 in 2021, the child TB proportion amongst the overall TB notification for the same year was six per cent – far lower than the WHO benchmark of 12 per cent. This implies a high proportion of missing child TB cases in Nigeria. “Our DR-TB response has equally not yielded the desired results. Barely 2,975 of the estimated 21,000 DR-TB cases were notified in 2021. Another disturbing trend is the low enrolment rate of diagnosed DR-TB patients on treatment. Only 2,197 (74 per cent) of diagnosed DR-TB patients were enrolled for treatment in 2021. This is not encouraging as it is a far cry from our target of 100 per cent enrolment for diagnosed DR-TB patients. These untreated DR-TB patients constitute a time bomb as they continuously spread DR-TB in our communities.” On the efforts of the Federal Government, Ehanire noted that it had established a human resource centre for the control of TB through the regular training of health workers.
