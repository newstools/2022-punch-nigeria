The Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, Ogun State, has produced 542 distinction  out of 10,358 graduands in the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 combined convocation ceremonies . The rector of the institution, Dr Segun Aluko  disclosed this on Monday during a press briefing held in the school premises  as part of the activities of the convocation ceremonies  . Aluko said the polytechnic  could not hold 2019/2020 convocation ceremony last year due to the COVID-19 which led to the suspension of the ceremony . He, however, said the institution decided to combine the two ceremonies, which would hold on Wednesday, March 30. He said the ceremonies would be the last official event his administration would supervise since almost eight years when he assumed the office as Rector of the institution. Giving the breakdown of the grades, Aluko said the polytechnic graduands would confer Higher National Diploma and Ordinary National Diploma on 10,358 which consisted of 5,124 and 5,234 for the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 academic sessions respectively.
