A former Borno State Governor, Ali Modu-Sheriff, Sunday in Abuja, said he will pull out of the chairmanship race of the All Progressives Congress. This is as he said he respects the decision of the party which has zoned the apex office to the Northcentral and also the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). However, he noted that he will throw in his hat if the party rescinds its decision to keep the chairmanship office solely in the Northcentral. Sheriff’s decision comes barely one week before the national convention which holds on March 26. The former Governor who comes from the Northeast zone had expressed interest in the party’s apex seat before the zoning decision released about two weeks ago by the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee.
