Vice President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) on Tuesday shelved his planned trip to Eko Hotels in Lagos State, the venue of the 13th Bola Ahmed Tinubu Colloquium. The VP’s spokesman in a tweet said his principal, who was already on his way to Lagos for the colloquium made a detour to Kaduna on Tuesday afternoon on receiving disturbing report of terrorist attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train. Akande wrote, “On his way to Lagos for the 13th Tinubu Colloquium marking former Lagos State Gov’s 70th birthday, VP had to detour to Kaduna this afternoon on receiving news of the extent of human & material losses occasioned by yesterday’s dastardly attack on the Abuja-Kaduna railway route.” Terrorists had attacked the Abuja-Kaduna train on Monday night with hundreds of passengers on board. Meanwhile, All Progressives Congress National Leader (Tinubu), has also cancelled the Colloquium in the spirit of “national tragedy and concern”. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
