The All Progressives Grand Alliance has said the unfolding events with regards to a former Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano’s ordeal in the hands of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission have proven that he is being persecuted. A video of Obiano in EFCC custody was leaked and the video is currently trending on social media platforms. Speaking to our correspondent in Awka, on Sunday, the National Coordinator, APGA Media Warriors Forum,  Chinedu Obigwe, said the video showed that EFCC was being used to witch-hunt the former governor. Obigwe added that the EFCC does not have any justification to use the trending video to mock Obiano by showing the world that he is being humiliated in custody. He said, “Everybody is asking, what wrong has Obiano done to deserve such ill-treatment from EFCC. Rev. Fr. Obimma, popularly known as Ebube Muonso, said it all when he declared to his audience in his adoration ministry that the only offence of Obiano is that he is not a member of the APC. “I always refer to APC as an Association of Past Criminals party where those that looted Nigeria treasury dry run to for protection and safety.” He said the EFCC must produce its employee that recorded video and punish him or her.
