The Green Nigeria Movement has said that it will not support any presidential candidate who is above 70 years old. The group disclosed this on Tuesday at a Consultation Breakfast Meeting with Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) held in Abuja. Convener of the GNM and Chairman of the Nigerian Young Professionals Forum, Mr Moses Siasia, said the group is posed to mobilise up to 12 million votes for a credible Presidential Candidate at the forthcoming 2023 general elections. He, however, said the movement has resolved to support a presidential candidate who is not more than 70 years old. He lamented that there was no synergy among CSOs, noting that standalone political movement throws their weights at the giant task of charting a new course for Nigeria’s polity. “At GNM, we are not lost to the realities that there is no cause that can advance without partnership and collaboration. That is why we are gathered here as movers and shakers to harness our expertise towards promoting active participation of young people in politics, as well as to support a technocrat and seasoned professional in the forthcoming elections,” he said. Country Director, Accountability Lab Nigeria, Mr Odeh Friday, called for the representation of Persons Living With Disability and more women in the activities of the group. President of SWA Sports, Aisha Shuaibu, charged the group to gather “like-minded individuals, build networks, collect data, and be honest in its activities”, adding that her platform will be used to mobilise votes for the right candidate chosen by the GNM. The Presidential and National Assembly elections have been slated for February 25, 2023, while Governorship and State Assembly elections will now be held on March 11, 2023, according to the Independent National Electoral Commission announced.
