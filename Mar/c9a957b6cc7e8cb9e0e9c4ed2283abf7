The Akwa Ibom State Government has ordered the closure of the Community Comprehensive Secondary School, Aka Offot, in the Uyo Local Government Area of the state after a suspected cultist, one Samuel Archibong, stabbed an SSS2 pupil, James Elijah, to death. It was learnt that Archibong, an ex-pupil of the school was expelled over cult-related issues, stabbed Elijah, aged 18, on Thursday. A source revealed there had been a minor disagreement between the two, adding that in the ensuing scuffle, Archibong reportedly brought out a knife, stabbed his victim to death and fled. “He ran away after stabbing James to death. Those angry pupils would have killed him if they had met him at home. They must have gone to his father’s house to avenge their colleague’s death’,” the source in the school said. The Commissioner for Education, Mrs Idongesit Etiebet, while condemning the incident ordered that the institution be shut to enable the State Secondary Education Board and the Ministry of Education to wade into the matter and restore calm. “We advised parents to ensure their wards remain indoors until the ministry and the school wade into the matter to restore normalcy,” Etiebet said. Meanwhile, the Police Public Relations Officer, Odiko Macdon who confirmed the incident, said the Commissioner of Police, Andrew Amiengheme, condemned the barbaric act. Copyright PUNCH.
