Alex Iwobi will look to end a three-year goals drought in the oldest football competition in the world, the FA Cup, when Everton take on National League side Boreham Wood in a fifth-round tie at Goodison Park on Thursday (today), PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The 25-year-old last scored in the competition on January 5, 2019 – a late finish, while at Arsenal as the Gunners routed Blackpool 3-0 in a third-round tie. The much-maligned midfielder, who was the target of Everton fans when the Toffees were struggling under former manager Rafael Benitez, has flourished since coming into the first team as part of Frank Lampard’s new system. The Nigerian is also in line to make his 85th appearance for the Toffees today. Iwobi, who has scored six times, with six assists since his arrival at Everton in 2019, will also look to end his eight-game goals drought for the club this season, against their less-fancied foes. The Nigerian’s only goal this season in 19 games was in the Toffees 2-1 win at Huddersfield in the Carabao Cup and their defeat to Wolves at the Molineux in the Premier League. A win in Thursday’s (tonight) clash would leave Everton just one win away from a trip to Wembley. Iwobi, who is expected to be named in Nigeria’s squad for their Qatar 2022 World Cup play-off game against Ghana later this month, won the FA Cup once with Arsenal in 2017.  Copyright PUNCH.
