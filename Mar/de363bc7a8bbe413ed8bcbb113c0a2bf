The family of a 16-year-old boy, Emmanuel Odion, have raised the alarm over his disappearance while attending a Catholic church in Fimie, Port Harcourt, Rivers State. PUNCH Metro learnt that Emmanuel lived with his parents at Bakery Avenue, Ozuboko, also in Port Harcourt. His mother, Faith Odion, while narrating the incident to journalists in Port Harcourt, said he was last seen on Sunday when he left home for a church service. While expressing worry over the boy’s whereabouts and his state of health, she appealed to the police and other security agents to find the boy. “I live at Ozuboko in Abuloma. Our church is Holy Trinity Catholic Church, Fimie. On Sunday, he went to church in the morning but did not come back. “Before then, he was saying that he wanted to go and meet his sister at Iwofe (Obio/Akpor LGA). “I told him to wait that I would take him there next week. Before I returned from church that Sunday, he had already left. He told our neighbour that he was going to church. So, when I came, I didn’t see him. I went to the church to look for him, but I didn’t see him. “I went to Mile One, thinking that maybe he went to his sister’s place. I even went to Iwofe, the other sister’s place, but I didn’t see him there,” she added. The acting spokesperson for the state police command, Grace Iringe-Koko, could not be reached for comments as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
