Three weeks after the war between Russia and Ukraine began, the Federal Government says it is working on a new trade policy with nations under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republic, with whom it shares important mutual trade relations. The policy is meant to immune the Nigerian economy from the numerous sanctions from Western countries currently strangling Russia. The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investments, Niyi Adebayo, disclosed this to State House correspondents on Thursday in Abuja during the weekly inter-ministerial briefing at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. According to Adebayo, the trade policy will be subjected to thorough considerations before being presented to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) and, finally, to the public. He also revealed that the trade department of his ministry had been mandated to analyse the crisis in the region as its concerns trade with Nigeria to come up with a report. Asked if the sanctions imposed on Russia would affect Nigeria, the Minister said, “My ministry is looking at all the issues involved since the war has come up. The trade department is looking at what we import and export to them with a view of coming up with a policy paper which we will present to Mr President. The minister who discussed the Presidential Sugar Backward Integration Programme noted that although local demand for sugar was 1.75 million metric tons as of 2021, only five per cent of the sugar consumed in the country is produced locally.
