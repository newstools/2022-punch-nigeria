The bursar of Ekiugbo Grammar School in the Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State and the chairman of the school’s Parent-Teacher Association have been arrested over alleged theft of the sum of N1.5m belonging to the school. PUNCH Metro gathered that the duo were nabbed by operatives from the Ughelli ‘A’ Police Division. A source told journalists that the school principal had earlier instructed the bursar and the PTA chairman to withdraw N200,000 to pay workers repairing property damaged by some protesting students sometime in 2021. “They went to the bank and instead of withdrawing the said amount as directed by the principal, they withdrew the sum of N1.5m. On their way back from the bank, they were followed by gunmen to the school gate and the money was snatched from them,” the source stated. The school principal, Mrs Onojegharho Ese, could not be reached for comments on the incident. A security source disclosed that the bursar and the PTA chairman were granted bail after the leadership of the community waded into the matter. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe, said the claim of robbery attack at the school gate could not be substantiated. He, however, noted that investigations were ongoing into the case. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
