There was chaos at the entrance of Eagle Square, Abuja, on Saturday as security agents fired several rounds of teargas at delegates as well as officials finding their way into the venue of the 2022 All Progressives Congress national convention. Our correspondent who was on the ground observed that with over 1000 security agents deployed to ensure decorum at the venue, the sights at the entrance of Eagle Square were far from organized. Several security agents were seen wielding whips, teargas canisters and stun guns which they deployed as they deemed fit. Amidst the tussle, some individuals reportedly got injured and lost their valuables such as mobile phones and cameras. According to the schedule of events released on Thursday by the Chairman of the Media and Publicity Sub-Committee for the APC 2022 National Convention, Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State, accredited national delegates, Caretaker Committee members and Chairman, APC State Governors, lawmakers, the President and Vice President would arrive between 10:00 am until 03:30 pm, when the Convention begins proper.
