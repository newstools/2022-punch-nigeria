Thirty-one million, one hundred and sixty thousand Nigerians live in areas without telecommunication coverage, according to the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy. The ministry revealed this in the appendix of its ‘Nigerian National Broadband Plan 2020 – 2025’ document. According to the ministry, unserved areas are locations without any service provider coverage. It added that in 2013 there were 207 clusters without network coverage which reduced to 114 in 2019. It said, “Broadband coverage to unserved areas is critical to ensure delivery of quality internet services and to provide access to enhanced economic and social opportunities such as financial inclusion, and access to government services including security agencies for every Nigerian. “Key access gaps have been addressed through intervention programs implemented to ensure the unserved (no operator present) and underserved (areas with only one operator) receive the benefits of broadband connectivity, but there is more to be achieved. “In 2013, 207 clusters were unserved per USPF; by Q4, 2019 this number had been reduced to 114 and was achieved via USPF support in providing funding for connectivity to 93 unserved clusters over six years.” According to the World Bank, there were 206.14 million Nigerians in 2020. This means that 15.12 per cent of Nigerians do not have access to telecommunication services.
