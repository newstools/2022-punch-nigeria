The Chinese Embassy to the United States, on Wednesday, urged its citizens in the U.S. to take measures ensuring their personal safety amid alleged rising discrimination against Chinese nationals in the country, the News Agency of Nigeria reports. “Make sure you reinforce your safety precautions. “If you encounter targeted discrimination and violence, remain calm, handle it correctly, try to avoid quarrels and physical conflicts. “You should pay attention to collecting evidence to ensure your own safety,” the embassy’s statement read. The embassy noted that there is much hatred towards China in the U.S., according to NAN. “Many Asians have faced assaults, particularly those who work in Chinese-funded institutions and international students,” the embassy said.
