Popular singer and dancer, Korra Obidi, has asked her fans and the public to recognise her music as much as her dance. The singer, in a Facebook video on Saturday, joked that despite doing music for seven years, they still referred to her as a ‘popular dancer.’ The singer said that she knew that her dance was good but asked the public to recognise her music as well. Korra said this while joking about how the media would have painted her body posture in the live video. “Popular dancer, Korra Obidi caught exposing cleavage to fans,” she joked. “When I’ve been doing music for seven years, you guys are still calling me a dancer. “But thank you, I know that I know how to dance, but please recognise that my music is dope as well, I use God’s name to beg you,” she said. While wrapping up her live video, Korra, whose husband, Justin Dean, had earlier announced a divorce plan, said that being a mother of two had been a different ball game for her. In her words, “I’ll tell you something, being a mother of two is a different ball game, this is a full-time job.” “I’m doing it by myself. Respect mothers, respect women,” she said, kissing her newborn baby. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
