Terrorists, on Thursday, invaded the Agunu Dutse community in the Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State and abducted 47 persons, while one other person sustained gunshot injuries. A resident, Mr Philip John, who confirmed the incident, said the terrorists invaded the community on foot around 1am. According to him, the terrorists came in large numbers and took vantage positions and shot indiscriminately to scare the residents. John explained that the community was about two kilometres away from the Akada Barracks. He stated, “The victims comprised 16 men, nine children and 32 women. “The villagers could not repel them because of the kind of sophisticated weapons they were using.” “The kidnappers have not yet established any contact with the victims’ families.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, did not take his calls as of the time of filing this report.
