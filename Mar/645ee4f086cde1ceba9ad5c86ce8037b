Terrorists have killed one person and abducted several others in communities in Munya Local Government Area of Niger state. The attack was said to have begun at about 2 pm on Friday when the terrorists attacked Zazzaga market, unleashing terror on the people. They (terrorists) were said to have spread themselves into different communities in the area from the market. Saturday PUNCH gathered that the terrorists killed one person at Fuka, abducted a yet to be identified number of persons and burnt down houses and food barns. They were said to have moved from one community to the other, attacking residents unhindered, which forced the people to flee their homes. The Secretary of Munya Local Government Council, James Jagaba, confirmed the attack, saying that one of the communities was still under attack as at the time he was speaking to our correspondent. “Presently, they have entered Dandaudu which is one of the urban wards in Munya LGA. They are there presently. They are displacing the whole local government area. We hold programmes in Dandaudu because it is safe but now, it is no longer safe. The bandits are there now”, he said.
