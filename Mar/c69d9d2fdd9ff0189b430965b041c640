Celebrity fashion designer, Olorunyomi Makun, popularly known as Yomi Casual, has advised married women to avoid turning their caring husbands into monsters. He made this known on his Instagram story on Sunday night as he informed women that though they may be boss ladies, they shouldn’t see their husbands as their competition. Yomi, whose brother is the popular comedian and actor, Ayo ‘AY’ Makun, then asked ladies to drop their “boss lady” titles when they relate to their partners. He wrote, “Dear wives, please don’t use your hands to turn your caring husband into a monster. It’s ok to be a boss lady, but please don’t bring that vibe to your husband if he is a sweetheart from day 1. He is not your competition.” The fashion designer also advised ladies that they shouldn’t treat men like what they (ladies) have been through. “Ladies, when you find a good man, please don’t treat him like what you have been through. He came into your life to make things beautiful and different,” he added. This wasn’t the first time that the celebrity fashion mogul would advise married women. In an Instagram post last month, Yomi had advised women to honour those who had played a role in their husbands’ successes. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
