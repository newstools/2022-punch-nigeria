The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2019 election, Abba Yusuf and his running mate, Aminu Abdulsalam, have defected to the New Nigeria Peoples Party. Yusuf, popularly known as Abba Gida-Gida in Kano, is also the son-in-law to Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, a former governor of Kano State. Yusuf, who announced his defection to the NNPP at a gathering on Sunday at Diso ward, Gwale LGA of the state, said the PDP had failed its supporters. According to him, there is no difference between PDP and the All Progressives Congress, adding that his decision to dump the opposition party as a result of “the yearning of my teeming supporters.” He noted, “Today, God in His infinite mercy has joined us once again in this Kwankwasiyya house at Diso ward. We met here in 2018 when we entered the PDP and officially told the world that we have left the APC. Our reason for leaving the APC at that time was because of injustice. They have gone in the wrong lane they were not supposed to. “When they started doing unholy things, we decided we cannot move along with them and defected to the PDP. At that time, we thought there was a difference between the APC and PDP. It is after we went a long way, we discovered that they are all birds of the same feather. The reasons that made us defect from APC is the same thing we found ourselves deeply in the PDP. “The PDP has done a lot of unfavourable things, especially at the national headquarters. We thought they would do justice to us, especially our leader, Kwankwaso. “We thought the PDP will show love to the people of Kano state who came out massively in the year 2019 and voted for the party. But what it is doing in return is going against leaders. We discovered that whoever has the masses at heart, the party doesn’t like that person.”
