Burnley’s attempt to rescue Victor Moses from the distress of being left in limbo in warring Russia has been blocked by the Premier League. Moses, a former Chelsea wing-back, is considered out of contract until June 30 this year and can be signed under a special dispensation granted by FIFA and UEFA. There has been a temporary amending of the statutes governing transfers due to Russia’s war on Ukraine. Burnley have tried to provide Moses with the opportunity to play again, earn a salary, and be reunited with his family in England, but the Premier League does not want to accept any such request, citing the sporting integrity of the competition. La Liga has been allowing clubs to sign footballers affected by the war, while Sheffield United became the first English side to recruit a player – Filip Uremovic – as a result of his contract with a Russian team being temporarily suspended. The Premier League has come under criticism for its stance. Former Finland captain Tim Sparv told Sky Sports News: “We need to do everything we can to help players get out of Russia, a country led by a dictator. “We need to give them the chance to go and play somewhere where they feel safe. This is a humanitarian issue.” Serie A and the Bundesliga have also barred clubs from using the special dispensation on the grounds of sporting integrity. It had seemed a joint-bid from the UK and Ireland would be the sole application for the tournament but on Wednesday Russia – despite the current suspension of their clubs and national teams by FIFA and UEFA over the country’s invasion of Ukraine – and Turkey surprisingly put their name forwards to host the competition. Russia and Turkey have also declared an interest in hosting Euro 2032, with Italy rivalling them for that edition of the European Championships. The Euro 2028 and Euro 2032 competitions will be awarded to host countries in September 2023. Skysports
