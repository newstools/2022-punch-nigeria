Former Arsenal boss, Arsene Wenger, has admitted he missed the football dugout, saying he may make a return to coaching. Wenger, who has been FIFA’s chief of global football development since 2019, claims leaving the dugout after 40 years is like coming off drugs. The Frenchman insisted he misses the ‘intensity’ of being in the dugout and claims he may make a sensational return to management. The 72-year-old left the Gunners in 2018 after 22 years in charge, and the Frenchman has not managed any professional outfit since at either club or international level. Wenger first went into management in 1984 with French outfit Nancy and went on to take charge of Monaco and Japanese outfit Nagoya Grampus Eight prior to his move to Arsenal in 1996. ‘I spent 40 seasons in the dugout and if I listen to my guts, I would still do it,’ Wenger told beIN SPORTS. ‘You know, I can contribute in a different way. I’m still missing it. I’m still missing the intensity of it. And so overall, I’m still vulnerable. I’m like a guy who’s off drugs. ‘I think as well I can contribute in a different way. Now to football and if I can do that worldwide, it’s satisfying. More intellectually, maybe when the physically intense, but maybe more efficient as well in the world.’
