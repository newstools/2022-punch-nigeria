The Rotary Club of Trans Amadi, District 9141 in Rivers State, has called on the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas to take up the full sponsorship of its spelling bee competition for primary and secondary schools in the state. The President, Rotarian Chinwe Asanga, made the call during the grand finale of the 11th edition of the club’s spelling bee competition for post-primary schools held in Port Harcourt on Thursday. Asanga said the competition was imperative to provide adequate opportunities for fair competition in rural schools as well as their peers in urban and private schools. “Just like the clamour for more which gave birth to the primary school’s category, there are calls from people to take this competition beyond the shores of River State. “My club’s desire is to make this spelling bee bigger and better. Therefore, while sending our profound gratitude to our supporters and NLNG, we ask that NLNG take up full sponsorship of this project next Rotary year which starts on July 1, 2022,” he stated. Asanga, who expressed the optimism that children would pay attention to reading as a result of the competition said, “Among many other reasons, we hope to improve poor spelling competence even at the point of graduating from secondary school.” Copyright PUNCH.
