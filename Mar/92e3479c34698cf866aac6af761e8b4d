Sodiq Yusuff returned to winning ways with a unanimous decision win over veteran Alex Caceres in one of the main card events at UFC Fight Night: Santos vs Ankalaev at UFC Apex in Las Vegas on Sunday. After the victory, Yusuff has said he would love to face Bryce Mitchell next. The featherweight fighter lost via unanimous decision to Arnold Allen in his last outing in 2021. He was inactive for 11 months due to a long battle with COVID-19 but showed no signs of being inactive as he attacked Caceres with inside leg kicks. By the end of the third round, Yusuff had connected with 40 leg kicks majorly hurting Caceres’ lead leg. The Nigerian won on all of the judges’ cards 30-27, 30-27, and 29-28. “I’m really excited,” Yusuff said of the win. “I was happy I was able to get that mat time. My plan was to go to my arm and kick to his arm, but his stance was a little bit too wide, so the inside (leg kicks) were a bit of an audible during the fight. “I lost vision in my left eye during the fight and it kind of messed me up a little bit but I was able to stay in the moment, stay composed and stick to the game plan.” The Nigerian who has promised to be more active henceforth has called out ninth ranked Mitchel. “I really want to test myself against Arkansas’ finest,” Yusuff said. “I’d really like to fight Bryce Mitchell.” Copyright PUNCH.
