A director and producer in both Kannywood and Nollywood, Ali Nuhu, has been unveiled as the brand ambassador of Checkers Custard for the northern part of Nigeria. During the unveiling, the Chief Executive Officer, Checkers Africa Limited, Ashish Checker, explained that the choice of Nuhu, as the company’s brand ambassador, went through rigorous and due process. He added that Nuhu would leverage his wide acceptability and recognition in the movie industry to capture the northern Nigeria market for the company. In his response on the occasion, Nuhu said, “I will do my best as a director, producer, and actor in both Kannywood and Nollywood to facilitate the penetration of Checkers Custard in all nooks and crannies in the North. “Checkers is what I’ve been consuming for a long time, right from when I was a kid and still consuming it to date. As an adult, I still have the urge to consume it. Custard is said to be originally meant for kids, which is not completely true. You have the milk and vanilla flavour. “Anybody, who wants to take custard should because it is good for the body. It is very good quality, that is why I call on youths and everybody to take it. Checkers has two distinct flavours, vanilla, and banana. They both have unique tastes for the young and old. As a widespread impression, Checkers Custard can be consumed by adults and kids.” The Managing Director of the company, Karan Checker, added, “Nuhu has an uphill task, as he has to be on the billboard, jingles, and advertising, as an already established name around Nigeria, we settled for Aliyu as our Brands Ambassador and decided to sign him as Brand Ambassador.
