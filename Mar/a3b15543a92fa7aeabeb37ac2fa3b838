A 52-year-old woman, Mrs Fatima Adesola, has appealed to well-meaning Nigerians to help her in getting funds to undergo a kidney transplant. Adesola, in an appeal letter sent to The PUNCH, said she was with an end-stage renal disease about two years ago. She said, “I have since been on haemodialysis two to three times weekly. I have experienced several near-death episodes due to medical complications from kidney failure. I am in a dire situation having managed the cost of my treatments and lost everything I have. I am a federal civil servant with the National Population Commission and due to my current earnings; I am unable to afford a kidney transplant. “The disease has placed a great burden on my family, and we have been stretched beyond our financial limits. The cost of the transplant has been estimated at approximately N15m. So far, I have been able to raise N7.8m towards the surgery. However, I require support to raise the remaining N7.2m. “My health condition is deteriorating by the day and as a result, I am seeking assistance from well-meaning Nigerians to save my life.” A medical report from the General Hospital, Gbagada, which was signed by a Consultant Nephrologist, Dr A.A Busari, confirmed Adesola’s ailment. “She has since been on twice-weekly haemodialysis and other nephrology care. She will eventually require a renal transplant,” the medical report partly read. Donations can be made into Adesola’s Guarantee Trust Bank account, 0659806591, and she can also be reached on her mobile number, 08189438037.
