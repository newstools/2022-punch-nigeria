To celebrate World Tuberculosis Day, the Edo State Government has urged residents of the state to take advantage of the free tuberculosis treatment programme available in public health centres across the state. The Director of Public Health, Edo State Ministry of Health, Dr Stephenson Ojeifo, during a sensitisation programme in Benin City, said that the government would continue to accord priority to the health needs of the people. Ojeifo said, “Tuberculosis is not a death sentence and the Edo State Government has evolved measures, which include free treatment of tuberculosis in health centres across the state.” He identified symptoms of TB to include persistent cough for more than a week, cough that contains blood, and consistent emaciation, adding that persons with such symptoms should visit the hospital for medical attention. The Director added that the state government would continue to enlighten and sustain awareness on the dangers of tuberculosis, symptoms, as well as the preventive measures to be taken against the spread of the disease.
