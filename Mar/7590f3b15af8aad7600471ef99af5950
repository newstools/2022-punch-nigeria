The Southern Taraba Movement for Better Tomorrow, on Sunday, called on the people of Taraba State to jettison zoning and support Senator Emmanuel Bwacha to become the governor of the state in 2023. At a press conference in Jalingo, spokesman for the group, Andeyaba Yirom, said Taraba State needed a leader like Bwacha who possessed the requisite experience in governance to transform the state. Yirom said Bwacha, who served as a member of the State House of Assembly and later became a commissioner, member of the House of Representatives and a ranking Senator, had all it takes to pilot the affairs of the state. He stated, “We need a leader in Taraba State now who can build infrastructure, revive the educational sector, build health care centres, revamp the agricultural sector, restore the lost glory of our traditional institution and create jobs for our teeming youths roaming the streets. “A better tomorrow is not a product of wishful thinking. It is a product of hard work and dedication. It is that time we rise and be part of the change we desire than sit and watch from the distance. “We can change the narratives and give the upcoming generation reason to smile and posterity will sure be kind to us.” “It is with this strong conviction that we are here today to endorse the candidacy of distinguished Sen. Emmanuel Bwacha and Hon. Danjuma Usman Shidi for governor and senator, respectively. “The two political figures possess the political, intellectual, right mental psychology and socio-economic fitness to pilot the affairs of the state as governor and senator of our zone come 2023,” the group said.
