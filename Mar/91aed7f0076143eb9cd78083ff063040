The Managing Director of the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation, Mr Bello Hassan, has stressed the need to empower girls and women for sustainable development in the country. This was contained in a statement signed by the NDIC MD and distributed on Wednesday. The MD appreciated the women in the NDIC, describing them as a great asset to the company. He said, “Here in the NDIC, our women are a great asset and they continue to demonstrate all the values that the corporation holds dear, such as professionalism and passion in ensuring the Corporation achieves its mandate. “This year’s International Women’s Day theme – ‘Gender Equality Today for Sustainable Tomorrow’ recognizes the contributions of women and girls all over the world who are leading on climate change adaptation, mitigation, and response to build a more sustainable future for everyone.” According to him, there is a need to examine the opportunities and challenges to empowering girls and women to promote gender equality in the country “The need to continue to examine the opportunities, as well as the constraints, to empower women and girls to have a voice and be equal players in decision-making related to climate change and sustainability is essential for sustainable development and greater gender equality. Without gender equality today, a sustainable future, and an equal future, remains beyond our reach,” the MD said. He appreciated the efforts of the women in the NDIC, and assured them of his continuous support to provide an enabling environment for the women to thrive.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
