BLACK STARS midfielder, Daniel-Kofi Kyereh, has continued to show why he is a player to watch out for when they face Nigeria in their Qatar 2022 World Cup play-offs on March 25 in Cape Coast and March 29 at the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja. The Ghana international scored a brace for St Pauli in their 3-1 win over Karlsruher in German Bundesliga on Saturday to end an impressive week for the club having scored a superb free kick against Bundesliga side Union Berlin in their 2-1 loss in the DFB-Pokal on Wednesday. The Accra-born midfielder has been a key member of the Black Stars since making his debut for the West African country in their 1-0 win over Ethiopia in a 2022 World Cup qualifying group stage encounter in March 2021. Kyereh has gone on to make eight appearances for the country. Although he is yet to get a goal or assist for Ghana, he will be heading into the game full of confidence having been in good form for St Pauli. He has scored 10 goals and provided 11 assists in 25 games across all competitions for the German side. The first leg encounter will be the 58th clash at senior level between the two West African countries in a rivalry spanning seven decades.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
