The Chairman, Trade Union Congress in Ekiti State, Sola Adigun, has urged the state Petroleum Task Force to check the wave of alleged hoarding of Premium Motor Spirit in the state. Adigun said the hoarding of petrol in the state had led to an increase in pump prices. According to him, this is making life unbearable for the masses, especially workers in the state. He disclosed this in a statement. He said, “The state Task Force on Petroleum should justify the essence of its existence and protect the people from Shylock businessmen who are bent on making life unbearable for the people. “Apart from Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation and BOVAS petrol stations that sell petrol at N165 per litre with buyers keeping vigils, others especially the outlets of independent marketers sell the product at between N220 and N300 per litre while black marketer sell the product at N500 per litre.” According to Adigun, marketers of petrol need to consider the interest of the workers, and people who need to move daily. He added, “Workers who have to move several kilometres to work are worst hit by the unjustifiable scarcity and illegal increase in the pump price and the attendant skyrocketing prices of commodities.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
