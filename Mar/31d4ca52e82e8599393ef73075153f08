The National Board for Arabic and Islamic Studies has reached an advanced stage for the digitisation of its operations, its Registrar and Chief Executive, Prof. Muhammad Shafiu Abdullahi has said. According to him, NBAIS is also planning to increase the number of schools attending their examinations across the country. Abdullahi said this in Abuja during a two-day workshop on ‘Corporate communication and strategic information management’ for NBAIS officers, organised in collaboration with Clanfield Communications Limited. “We have not less than 1,600 schools across the country sitting for our examinations and same time we achieved to convince the government to give us recognition, approval to operate nationally,” he said. While expressing optimism that NBAIS had many plans to expand its activities nationwide, Abdullahi said that since the current board was new, it was important to get them and all the staff, to be abreast of the latest trend in ICT and technology to achieve the mandate of the board. He said, “We have workers on ICT, most of them are new; you know, the board started new recently. So, we need to educate our people on that area, that is why we planned the workshop.” “We have a unique and national curriculum for Arabic and Islamic schools. Secondly, we are able to mobilize even government to establish such institutions.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
