An Ekiti State High Court sitting in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, has sentenced a man, Tunmise Abraham, to death by hanging for raping and killing his landlady, Mrs Bukola Olanrewaju, a mother of three. The court found Abraham guilty of raping and killing his landlady at the Olorunda Zone 7 area of Ado-Ekiti in 2019. The defendant, now condemned, was alleged to have broken into the landlady’s room, threatened her with a cutlass and tied her up before carrying out the act. According to a witness, the landlady was alone at home after her husband had gone to work and her children were away for holiday coaching when the incident happened. The Director of Public Prosecution, Mr Julius Ajibare, who prosecuted the case on behalf of the state government, called four witnesses to prove his case. Delivering the verdict on Wednesday, Justice Oluwatoyin Abodunde, found Abraham guilty of the offences as charged and sentenced him to death.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
