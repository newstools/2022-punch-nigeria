THE Chancellor, Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Dr David Oyedepo,  has told students to develop high-level discipline so as to attain high-level achievement. Oyedepo said this at the 20th matriculation of CU. The institution matriculated a total of 1,804 undergraduate and 120 postgraduate students. Oyedepo added, “You are absolutely responsible for the outcome of your life. It takes high-level discipline to make high-level achievements. We are raising a new generation of leaders who will redeem the battered image of the black race and restore her lost glory as this trained army of reformers begins to build the old waste, repair the wasted cities and raise the desolation of many generations.” The Pro-Chancellor, Bishop David Abioye, told the students that self-discipline was the only attribute needed to be distinguished in their studies or in any field of human endeavour. “Finally, may I share this thought with you as drawn from an international speaker, Van Crouch, referring to three important factors that contribute to one’s success in life; the Persons you meet, the Books you read and the Places you visit or pass through. I believe that studying at Covenant University, meeting with our distinguished faculty, interacting with co-students and passing through this incubating ground will certainly be a memorable adventure not to be forgotten in many years to come.” Also speaking, the Vice-Chancellor of CU, Prof. Abiodun Adebayo, encouraged the matriculating students to avail themselves of the world-class learning experiences and opportunities in CU.
