THE cost of damage to Ukrainian civilian property and state infrastructure caused by Russia’s invasion from destruction due to a full-scale war from Russia is already in excess of $100bn, Oleh Ustvenko, an advisor to the Ukrainian President, told the Interfax news agency on Friday. The Russian military attack has forced half of Ukraine’s businesses to stop working, he said. Ustvenko said the real cost of repairing all the infrastructure, hospitals, residential buildings, businesses and residences damaged or destroyed by Russian Federation military action in Ukraine was certainly well above $100bn, and the number was increasing constantly. Ustvenko called for Russian financial assets to be frozen abroad, particularly the reserves of the Russian Central Bank to be mobilised to repair Russian-caused destruction in Ukraine. He recommended that the frozen assets of Russian oligarchs be sent to Ukraine to repair the damage. There have been terrible strikes on homes, schools, and hospitals around Ukraine. Residents of Schastia, a small town near Volnovakha had said the barrage of shelling, rocket assaults and airstrikes since the start of the war had damaged or destroyed nearly every building in their town.
