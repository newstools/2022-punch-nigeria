German football coach Markus Gisdol said Tuesday that he quit as head coach of Russian side Lokomotiv Moscow in protest over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Being a football coach is the best job in the world, but I can’t pursue my vocation in a country whose leader is responsible for a war of aggression in the middle of Europe,” Gisdol told German daily Bild. “That’s not in line with my values.” The 52-year-old took over in Moscow last October but quit because “I can’t stand on the training ground in Moscow and a few kilometres away orders are given that bring great suffering to an entire nation. “This is my personal decision and I am absolutely convinced of that.” However, in a statement on the club’s website, Lokomotiv Moscow said Gisdol was “dismissed” with former German defender Marvin Compper replacing him as caretaker coach.
