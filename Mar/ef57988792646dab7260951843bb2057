Baobab for Women’s Human Rights has stated that men in the National Assembly lack respect for women. The group called on Nigerians to protect the present and future generations of women by giving them rightful places in the scheme of things. In a statement issued in Jos by the Executive Director of the group, Mrs Bunmi Dipo-Salami, she said that men who were elected by both women and men to serve the nation are showing a lack of respect and dignity for the rights of women. “We demand that the National Assembly puts the advancement of women on the agenda by approving the relevant bills.
We also call on the government to end practices that undermine the dignity of women,” she said in reaction to the National Assembly’s vote against bills seeking gender equality in the country. Dipo-Salami said that the rejection of the bills came at the beginning of the global women’s history month on the first day in March. She said, “The gender bills proposed in the amendment of the Nigerian constitution sought to enhance the lives of women and provide opportunities for them to participate fully in the political governance space and inclusive citizenship rights. “The bills include special seats for women in the national and state houses of assembly, expansion of the scope of citizenship by registration (citizenship to the foreign-born husband of a Nigerian woman). “Also, affirmative action for women in political party administration (grant women 35 per cent affirmative action in party administration and leadership) and reserved quota for women (grant 35 per cent appointed positions to women).” She observed that in the ninth National Assembly, only eight out of 109 senators were women, only 22 representatives out of 360 House of Representatives members were women. She added further that there is no single female Governor in the country. (NAN)
