Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Monday, commended residents of Osogbo, the state capital, for their patience and understanding during the period of the construction of Olaiya flyover. Oyetola spoke after leading some members of his cabinet to perform a ‘test running and first ride’ on the bridge. The governor said the flyover was opened for use in fulfilment of his administration’s commitment to alleviating possible hardship the closure of the area might have caused motorists and other road users during the construction period. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Ismail Omipidan, noted that Oyetola further assured of the administration’s commitment to the infrastructural development of the state. He further disclosed that security measures had been put in place particularly around the bridge, to ensure safety, adding that no effort would be spared to ensure the security of lives and property of the citizens. The statement further read in part, “I commend our people, particularly the people of Osogbo and specifical residents of this area and those whose source of livelihood hinged on this area, for their patience, perseverance and tolerance that had helped to ensure the success of this project. “We are not doing the commissioning yet, what we are doing is to open up the bridge for vehicular movement. I commend the Ministry of Works and internal and external consultants for the thorough supervision they have done to ensure quality delivery. “I want to enjoin the road users to continue to observe precautions and put the infrastructural facilities into good use. They should see this as theirs which must be properly maintained and treasured.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
