All Progressives Congress in Osun state on Wednesday said the Peoples Democratic Party should expect a defeat during the July 16 gubernatorial election in the state. This was contained in a statement issued by Osun’s APC Director of Publicity, Research and Strategy, Kunle Oyatomi, who said PDP has made Osun APC job easier, as neither Senator Ademola Adeleke nor Prince Dotun Babayemi, who both picked its governorship ticket could withstand its candidate, Adegboyega Oyetola. The party said none of the factional candidates could compete or be a threat to Oyetola’s re-election. The statement read in part, “None of PDP’s factional candidates jostling for the governor’s seat has political value to make any serious impact in the race against the people’s governor. Put together, governor Gboyega Oyetola will defeat both of them to emerge victorious in the election.” But reacting, the PDP in a statement by its Publicity Secretary, Ayodeji Areola, said APC was jittery and scared of political death with the emergence of Adeleke as the governorship candidate of the PDP. He further said, “We sense the APC was pained by its gross failure to achieve its devilish plot of permanently gridlocking PDP to prevent us from producing an official challenger who will eventually take over the state. “After sponsoring several failed conflicts in PDP, the APC is disturbed that the man it feared most has finally received official endorsement of party delegates and is ready to retake the stolen mandate.” Copyright PUNCH.
