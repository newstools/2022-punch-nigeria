Popular skit maker and actor, Samuel Perry, aka Broda Shaggi, has said he stopped referencing Florence Otedola, who is widely known as DJ Cuppy, as his love interest because his content had evolved. Shaggi, who in time past made reference to DJ Cuppy as his love interest revealed why he stopped during a live broadcast on Hip TV. He said, “It was part of the content when I started that time but now content has evolved. We have moved to another content.” Shaggi, who is one of the most followed content creators on social media, also said he had taken the profession as a fulltime job. “I have taken this as my 24-7 job. Every time I create content, I create my time to plan the shoot. No time. I don’t go out that much. I am more of an indoor person. I don’t club, not that it’s a bad thing, it’s just my person. “My home inspires me. I live alone, I get inspiration when I am alone and most of the time when I am alone you just see me laughing. I live alone, jot things down, and write stories,” he said. Debunking the claim that content creators were involved in cybercrime, Shaggi said he doesn’t have the guts to be involved in such an illicit act. He said, “I don’t have the guts to do ‘yahoo’. Content creation is what I do aside from my other businesses. It’s what I started with. It is what put me out there. Through this content creation endorsements have come in, a lot has come to me. I just stay true to myself.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
