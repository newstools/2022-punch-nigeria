The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in Ekiti State, Biodun Oyebanji, has called on party members and supporters to demonstrate their love for his candidacy and desire for victory in the June 18 election by registering and collecting their permanent voter cards. Oyebanji urged his supporters and members of the APC to approach the Independent National Electoral Commission offices close to them and collect their PVCs in order to be eligible to vote for him, adding that “I must say that we need aggressive voter education for our people to register and mobilise to get their PVCs to vote for us.” The APC candidate, represented by a former Commissioner for Environment, Gbenga Agbeyo, who spoke in Ado Ekiti on Friday during the inauguration of the Situation Office of BAO Family Network, said he would strive to ensure all supporters were eligible to vote by having their PVCs. He lauded the vision of the BAO Family Network to secure at least 16,000 votes for the APC during the governorship election with 1,000 votes in each of the 16 council areas of the state, disclosing that the 85 support groups that had so far declared for him would be structured under BAO Anchors Organisation for effective coordination and reward system.
