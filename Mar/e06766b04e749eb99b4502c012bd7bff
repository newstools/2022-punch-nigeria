THE President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (rted.), has approved the renewal of the appointments of Mallam Aliyu Dikko as chairman, and Mr Olukayode Pitan as the managing director/chief executive officer of the Bank of Industry for another term of five years. A statement said the new appointments which would take effect from May 27, 2022, was conveyed via a letter signed by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha, and dated March 11, 2022. The statement said, “Under Pitan’s leadership, BoI has consistently delivered on its mandate to transform Nigeria’s industrial sector by providing long-term financing and counter-cyclical loans diversified across industries such as agro-processing, gender businesses and renewable energy among others. “In the last five years, BoI has promoted financial inclusion by supporting the expansion of over three million enterprises, thereby creating over seven million jobs.” To expand its capital base to meet the needs of its customers, and contribute to the economic growth of Nigeria, the statement said Pitan led BOI’s successful foray into the international market and raised about $3.8bn in the last four years.
