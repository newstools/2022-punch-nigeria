The Peoples Democratic Party has called FOR an investigation into the just-concluded Ogoja/Yala Federal Constituency bye-election in Cross River State. The party alleged that the election was rigged, adding that the Independent National Electoral Commission’s Resident Electoral Commission in the state, Dr. Cyril Omorogbe, should also be probed. INEC declared the All Progressives Congress as the winner of the poll held on February 26, 2022. The party made the complaint in a press statement made available to newsmen in Abuja on Thursday. PDP also appealed to the Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmoud, to redeploy the REC with immediate effect. Part of the statement read, “It is unfortunate that officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission were involved in the shenanigans that characterised the bye-election of 26th February 2022 in Ogoja/Yala Federal Constituency. “The exercise which was marred by violence, killing, thuggery and unprecedented electoral fraud requires that the Resident Electoral Commissioner, the HOD of the Commission’s ICT unit and security agencies should be probed. “The Cross River INEC’s REC was quick to dismiss the petitions of the opposition over violence and irregularities that occurred in the process simply because he was under duress. The HOD of the ICT unit was supposed to ensure that results are shown in conformity with the biometric accreditation.”
