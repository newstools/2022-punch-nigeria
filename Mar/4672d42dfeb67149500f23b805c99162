The outgoing governor of Anambra State, Chief Willie Obiano, has left the venue of the swearing-in ceremony of the new Governor of the state, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo. He left the venue with his wife, Ebelechukwu, who trekked out of the venue at exactly 9.55 am. The incoming governor, Soludo had minutes ago taken his oath of office. Soludo came in the company with his wife, Mrs Nonye, while his Deputy, Dr Onyeka Ibezim also arrived with his wife. Obiano arrived in a convoy of cars, amidst cheers from Anambra people. He is currently inspecting the guard of honor, his last task as governor. Dignitaries in Anambra State and beyond are currently at the gate of the Anambra State government house, scrambling to enter the venue of today’s swearing-in. Prof. Soludo had at an earlier function announced that not more than 50 people will attend the event, as he intends that it will be brief enough to end on time and allow him space to move to Okpoko, where he intends to start work.
