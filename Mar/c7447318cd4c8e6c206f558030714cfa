Youths in Ikole Ekiti in the Ikole Local Government Area of Ekiti State on Monday trooped to the streets to protest against the high rate of kidnapping in the area. The placard-carrying youths, who said kidnapping had become a daily occurrence in the community, lamented that many people had been whisked away by gunmen in the last few days. Among inscriptions on the placards are, ‘Ikole is bleeding, rescue us’, ‘Our lives matter, save our souls’, ‘Fayemi, do something’, ‘Go tough on kidnapping’, ‘Stop kidnapping in Ikole local government’, ‘Our traditional rulers, don’t sleep,’ and ‘Is this how we will continue?’ The youth, who sang solidarity songs, barricaded roads to show their grievances, saying they could no longer bear the situation as they now lived in fear in their fatherland. The leader of the protesters and Speaker, Ekiti Youth Parliament, Mr Toba Fatunla, said, “Killings and kidnapping have now become a daily occurrence in the community. More worrisome is the fact that the perpetrators operate without any check. Several persons abducted few days ago are still in the den of kidnappers. We call on the state government and the security agents to take pragmatic steps to end the ugly situation.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
