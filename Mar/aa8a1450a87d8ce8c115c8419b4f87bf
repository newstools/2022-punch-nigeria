Governor Abdullah Ganduje of Kano State has said that the stakeholders of the ruling All Progressives Congress from the North-West zone have raised committees to reconcile disagreements among party members from the zone. This was contained in a statement signed by Abba Anwar, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Ganduje and issued to newsmen on Monday. According to Anwar, Ganduje made this known in Abuja while referring to a meeting he held with governors from the zone and other critical stakeholders that took place at the Governor’s Lodge of Katsina State, Asokoro, Sunday night. “Because of the misunderstanding some members of the party have among themselves in different places of the zone, we came together and discussed at length. “We raised different committees that will look into states with such problems and it was agreed that the committees will start their assignment from Kebbi and Kano States,” he said. “All party leaders are happy about this development because we are all concerned about how to make our party stronger and healthier at all times,” the governor reportedly added.
