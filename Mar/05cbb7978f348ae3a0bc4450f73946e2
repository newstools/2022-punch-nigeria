A power distribution company, Ikeja Electric, has renovated and upgraded the electrical workshop at the Government Technical College, Ikorodu, Lagos, as part of efforts to improve technical capacity building in the state. According to a statement on Wednesday, the Chief Executive Officer, IE, Folake Soetan, disclosed this during the inauguration of the workshop, adding that this is part of its social responsibilities. She said, “We acknowledge the efforts of federal, state and local governments in providing quality education for our children and raising the future leaders of tomorrow. No doubt, the responsibility being handled by government is huge and demand is enormous. Government cannot do it all alone. That is why private organisations like Ikeja Electric throw their weight behind initiatives that support government. “Therefore, in line with our commitment towards education, we decided to rehabilitate the electrical workshop at Government Technical College, Ikorodu, in order to further enhance technical capacity building and create a conducive learning environment for the students.” The Executive Secretary, Lagos State Technical and Vocational Education Board, Moronke Azeez, said the state has partnered with firms to train students in technical education. “The board is not only interested in the training of the students but is also engaging technical partners to help create start-ups and employment opportunities for them and the state currently has about 400 partners involved in the exercise,” she said. The Principal of Government Technical College, Ikorodu, Mrs Kenku Adedoyin, also applauded IE for expending resources and time in order to impact on the lives of students and teachers.
