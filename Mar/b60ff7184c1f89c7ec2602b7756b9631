The Nigeria Football Federation inspection team to Kumasi has okayed the Baba Yara Stadium, venue of the crucial Qatar 2022 World Cup first leg final qualifier between Nigeria and Ghana. The Eagles depart Abuja on Wednesday March 23 for the clash in Kumasi, scheduled for Friday March 25. The reverse fixture holds in Abuja four days later. The Ghanaians resorted to the Kumasi stadium, after the Confederation of African Football rejected the earlier presented Cape Coast Stadium on Wednesday. On Friday, NFF Executive Committee member, Aisha Falode, led the inspection team to the 40,653-capacity Baba Yara Stadium, situated in the heart of the city. Falode, who was conducted around by Emmanuel Appiah, Director, Ghana’s National Sports Authority, said the pitch was in a fine state ahead of the game. “That stadium (Baba Yara) is fantastic, the grass is beautiful, it is all natural and level. We are going to enjoy playing there on Friday,” Falode told PUNCH Sports Extra. “It was closed for maintenance work and it’s nice it’s hosting a game of this magnitude after several years.”  Copyright PUNCH.
