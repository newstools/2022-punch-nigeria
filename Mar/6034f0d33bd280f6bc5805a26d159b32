The Anambra State Government has described Air Peace’s commencement of three weekly flights into Niamey, Niger Republic, as a historic and decisive step in the economic integration of the African region. The statement government said the resumption of flights from Abuja and Kano from March was historic because it would help end the trend in Africa that forces passengers from some African cities to fly to Paris, London, Madrid, or Lisbon to catch a connecting flight to some other African cities. A statement by Air Peace quoted the Chief Operating Officer, Toyin Olajide, quoted the Anambra State Information and Public Enlightenment Commissioner, Don Adinuba, as also saying that Governor Willie Obiano was pleased with the development. “We are proud that a worthy indigene of Anambra State, Allen Onyema, founder and chairman of Air Peace, is playing a significant role in ending this regional blight which has been most embarrassing to all of us who are Africans,” Adinuba said Noting that Nigeria and the Niger Republic are not just two neighbouring countries, Adinuba said the citizens of both nations have much in common. Adinuba also reported that the incoming Anambra State Governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo, had called the Air Peace chairman on the phone to congratulate him on the flights. “As a pan Africanist myself enamoured of the visions of great statesmen like Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe of Nigeria, Dr Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Sekou Toure of Guinea and as someone who has worked and lived in places like Addis Ababa in pursuit of the vision of an integrated and developed Africa”, Soludo observed, Copyright PUNCH.
