Racing Genk and Nigeria international, Paul Onuchu, has been named in the latest Belgian Pro League Team of the Week, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. In a post published by football statistics website Whoscored.com, Onuachu has the highest rating of 9.2, thus making him the best-rated player in the Belgian Pro League Team of the Week ahead of Genk teammate Bryan Heynen, who has a rating of 8.7. The 27-year-old also tops Genk charts winning more aerial duels (three) and completed one dribble and made four key passes. The Nigeria international, who missed out on the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon due to a hamstring injury, has been in fine form recently, and has been involved in seven goals in his last seven appearances in the league, scoring four goals with three assists. Onuachu scored his side’s first goal in their 2-0 win against KV Kortrijk at the Luminus Arena on Sunday, before providing another fine assist for Joseph Paintsil to tap-in in the 22nd minute. Speaking after the game, the Super Eagles forward said he was not bothered about his number of goals this season. “To be honest, I’m not working on that,” Onuachu told Het Belang Van Limburg. “I am happy with the number of goals that I have already collected. “Well, 16 is not wrong, especially if you consider that we are currently only eighth. I’m happy with that. “My ambition is to score weekly and thus help the team to the necessary points. We’ll see how far I get with that. “This season is far from over. When I look at the classification, Play-Off 2 also promises to be a tough job. The competition will not be underestimated. But we are in the good flow, and we have to keep it up,” he added.
