A former Minister of State for Works, Chris Ogiemwonyi, has joined others to condole with the family of late Professor Grace Alele-Williams, describing her as an administrator par excellence and a woman of integrity. In a statement made on Sunday, Ogiemmwonyi, who was among the pioneer set of students at the University of Benin in 1970, said that the former Vice Chancellor, Williams, was a scholar and a lover of knowledge, adding that she was a great model to the female gender. The PUNCH reported that the first female VC and the first woman to receive a doctorate in Nigeria died in Lagos on March 25 at the age of 89 years. “Prof. Grace Alele-Williams, a scholar, an administrator par excellence, was a great role model to the female gender, whom she inspired with her brilliance and diligence. “Thankful to God, she lived a life of great impact, the late scholar’s drive and love for knowledge earned her many recognitions and awards in Nigeria and across the globe. “Her lasting memories will remain in the heart of those she left behind and they shall cherish her forever. “We are praying that God grant fortitude and comfort to the family she left behind, the Itsekiri community, and the entire staff and management of the University of Benin. May God Almighty grant her eternal rest,” Ogiemwonyi’s statement read. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
