FOLLOWING its 95th National Executive Council meeting on Wednesday, the Peoples Democratic Party has pegged its nomination and expression of interest forms for presidential aspirants at N40m. The party also approved the establishment of a 37-member zoning committee to make recommendations for the zoning of various elective positions for the 2023 general elections. The committee is expected to submit its report in two weeks. The party’s National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, disclosed this to reporters shortly after the conclusion of the NEC meeting on Wednesday evening at its national secretariat in Abuja. Ologunagba said, “The fees for expression of interest and nomination forms are as follows: state House of Assembly: expression of interest, N100, 000; nomination form, N500, 000. House of Representatives: expression of interest, N500, 000; nomination form, N2, 000,000. “Senate: expression of interest, N500, 000; nomination form, N3, 000,000. Governorship: expression of interest, N1, 000,000; nomination form, N20, 000,000. “President: expression of interest, N5, 000,000; nomination form, N35, 000,000.” The NEC also approved a 50 per cent reduction in nomination fees for youths aged 25 to 30 years for various elective positions as sale of forms begin on Thursday (today). The council also approved the PDP Electoral Guidelines for the conduct of primary elections and okayed the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general elections. In his comments shortly before deliberations began, the party’s National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, asked feuding members to forget their differences saying “no party member should attack another party member.” “The fact that we made a mistake along the line, and Nigerians lost confidence doesn’t mean that it is impossible for us to win in 2023. It is still possible because with unity, everything is possible. “I call on every member of this party to forget their differences. If there are differences, we must settle such differences in-house, no party members should attack another party member.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
