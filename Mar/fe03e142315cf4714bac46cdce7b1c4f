Yobe State Drugs and Medical Consumables Management Agency has announced the completion of six zonal medical warehouses, built to reduce the cost of logistics movement for drugs in the state. According to the News Agency of Nigeria, the state Commissioner for Health, Dr Lawan Gana, disclosed this while commissioning one of the warehouses in Potiskum. He said the warehouses were also set up to ensure high quality and affordable medication. He said, “It is not economically sensible to say that every person will have to travel to Damaturu, the state capital, to get their drugs and consumables. “As we are speaking, we have established that of Potiskum, Gashua, Nguru and Damaturu, soon we are going to have two more warehouses” He added that the agency had upgraded the warehouse in Damaturu in partnership with the Multi-Sectoral Crises Project. According to the commissioner, it is necessary that healthcare facilities always have medications.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
