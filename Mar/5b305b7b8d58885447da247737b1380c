Six persons vying for the position of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress have stepped down from the contest. The six former candidates have backed the candidate of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) as their consensus candidate, Senator Abdullahi Adamu. This was contained in a letter sent to the Chairman of the APC Election Sub-Committee on Friday, signed by Senator George Akume, who was also among those vying for the position.  Meanwhile, there was chaos at the entrance of Eagle Square, Abuja, on Saturday as security agents fired several rounds of teargas at delegates as well as officials finding their way into the venue of 2022 All Progressives Congress national convention. One of our correspondents who was on the ground observed that despite the over 1000 security agents deployed to ensure decorum at the venue, the entrance of Eagle Square was disorganised. Several security agents were seen wielding whips, teargas canisters and stun guns. Amidst the tussle, some individuals reportedly lost their valuables such as mobile phones and cameras. According to the schedule of events released on Thursday by the Chairman of the Media and Publicity Sub-Committee for the APC 2022 National Convention, Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State, accredited national delegates, Caretaker Committee members and Chairman, APC State Governors, lawmakers, the President and Vice President would arrive between 10:00 am until 03:30 pm, when the Convention begins proper.
