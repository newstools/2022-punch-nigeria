Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen, alongside Villareal winger, Samuel Chukwueze, have landed in the Super Eagles camp ahead of Nigeria’s 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff doubleheader against Ghana. Porto left-back, Zaidu Sanusi, also joined the rest of the squad bringing the total number of players in camp to 21. Osimhen’s arrival was confirmed by the Nigeria Football Federation via the Super Eagles’ official Twitter handle on Tuesday, which showed Osimhen at the gym. He said, “Victor Osimhen is here. 21 players in camp…Ekong, Balogun, Ajayi, Aina, Onyeka, Ighalo, Akpeyi, Musa, Etebo, Iheanacho, Abdullahi, Uzoho, Simon, Dennis, Aribo, Bassey, Bonke, Omeruo, Sanusi, Chukwueze, Osimhen.” Osimhen missed out on the 2021 African Cup of Nations in Cameroon after suffering a skull fracture during Napoli’s fixture against Juventus and later contracting COVID-19. The squad is expected to hold the first training session for the first leg fixture against Ghana on Tuesday, March 22, 2022. It is also expected that all invited players will show up today as preparation continues for the game. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
