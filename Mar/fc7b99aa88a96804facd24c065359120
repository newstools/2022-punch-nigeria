A group, under the aegis of Orji Uzor Kalu Movement Abia, has vowed to purchase nomination and intent form for, Senator Orji Kalu ahead of the 2023 Presidential Election. Director General of the OUK Movement Abia chapter, Agu Ndukwe, made the disclosure in a statement he signed and made available to newsmen on Saturday in Abuja. Ndukwe explained that the plan was already concluded if the All Progressives Congress zones the presidential ticket to the South East. He said that the group’s clamour for Orji Kalu is to enable him to replicate the outstanding feat he has achieved as the senator representing Abia North senatorial district. Ndukwe reiterated the group’s determination to mobilise funds to purchase the presidential nomination form for Kalu, adding that the Senate Chief Whip is an exemplary leader. “The OUK Movement Abia State as a foremost bi-partisan grassroots advocacy group has drummed up support and lend a strong voice,’’ he said. The group stressed that they had mobilised funds to purchase the presidential nomination form for Kalu should the APC microzone its presidential slot to the South East. Ndukwe expressed the preparedness of the group to also purchase senatorial form for Kalu to return to the senate if the presidency was not zoned to the South East. “And we will also mobilise funds and other essential resources
to ensure that OUK is reelected for a second tenure in 2023 as the robust senator representing the people of Abia North,” stated. (NAN)
