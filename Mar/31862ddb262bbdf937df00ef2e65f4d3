OSUN State Commissioner for Political Affairs and Intergovernmental Relations, Taiwo Akeju, has described a statement credited to the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the July 16, 2022 poll, Senator Ademola Adeleke, that the state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, was afraid of contesting against him as “a joke of the century.” Akeju, who insisted that people of the state are behind Oyetola to continue in office, added that Adeleke could not be governor since the incumbent has impacted positively on the lives of the residents. “Adeleke’s statement is a joke of the century. Oyetola is doing well for the people and they want him to continue. Adeleke will be defeated even in his Ede hometown,” Akeju said. Adeleke, who spoke at the PDP secretariat in Osogbo, shortly after he unveiled an ex-chairman of Osun East Local Government Area of Osun State, Kola Adewusi, as his running mate, said the people of the state have given Oyetola ‘a red card.’ Speaking in Yoruba language, Adeleke said, “Osun people should come out and vote for me during the poll. It is clear Oyetola and his party are afraid of contesting against me. “They should not be afraid yet. They should wait till election day. They will see the people of the state have given Oyetola a red card. By the grace of God, I will be announced as the winner of the contest.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
