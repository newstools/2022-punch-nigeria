OPPO Nigeria has announced the launch of its OPPO A96 smartphone. According to the firm, the A96 is equipped with a 5000mAh battery and 33W SUPERVOOCTM flash charging, and a 6.59-inch 90Hz colour-rich punch-hole display with 96 per cent NTSC wide colour gamut. In a statement, OPPO Nigeria Marketing Manager, Jennifer Okorhi, said, “The OPPO A96 is enhanced with features that will not only thrill our customers but enhance their daily functions. “It has been specifically designed to accommodate the intricacies of their lives while refusing to compromise on its outlook. For instance, the OPPO A96 has Optimized Night Charging, which allows the phone’s AI to learn the user’s sleep patterns and schedule a segmented battery charging plan during the nighttime. This simply means that you never have to wake up to an insufficiently charged device.” The firm added, “Powered by the Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 680 4G Mobile Platform, OPPO A96 delivers an exceptionally smooth user experience with the 8GB + 256GB large memory and storage. “This is complemented by RAM expansion which gives the OPPO A96 an extra boost to performance and storage, meaning better multi-tasking and smoother experience, and extra storage via SD card expansion to preserve more photos and videos. “OPPO A96 carries a 16MP front camera, producing gorgeous portrait shots. Features such as AI natural retouching include blemish removal while still preserving the user’s natural facial features. Portrait shots are now brighter and clearer in dim environments with the help of the 360° Fill Light feature.”
