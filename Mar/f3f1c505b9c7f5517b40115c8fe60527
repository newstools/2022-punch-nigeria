Ogbomoso Parapo, a socio-cultural organisation for indigenes of Ogbomoso town in Oyo State, said it has traced the ancestry of the Olubadan-designate, Oba Lekan Balogun, to the town. The Chairman of the organisation’s Southern Conference, Tayo Onakanmi, who led other executives of the group on a visit to the Olubadan-designate, said this in an interview with journalists after the visit in Ibadan on Wednesday. He said they came on the directive of the President of Ogbomoso Parapo Worldwide, Justice Afolabi Adeniran (retd.), to congratulate the monarch who will be installed on March 11. Onakanmi said, “We came to felicitate our father, the new Olubadan of Ibadan. After a careful research, we traced the origin of the new Olubadan to Ogbomoso and we are happy that one of us is the Olubadan now. “We pray God to give him good health and wisdom to direct the affairs of this big city, Ibadan.” The Olubadan-designate had while receiving another set of visitors led by a cultural ambassador promoting Asa Day, Olaniyi Oyatoye, at his residence, assured the people that he would do everything possible to promote Yoruba cultural heritage. The monarch said he would do his best to ensure that Yoruba culture was not relegated during his reign. Oyatoye, who is based in Canada, while speaking with journalists, said government was not paying enough attention to the promotion of culture despite its numerous benefits.  Copyright PUNCH.
