The Edo State Commissioner for Education, Joan Oviawe, has reportedly demoted the Principal of Imaguero Senior Secondary School in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. Her demotion, it was gathered, was due to the difficulties the Principal encountered in setting up the generator in the school during the Biometric registration exercise for the West African Examinations Senior Secondary School candidates in the school’s hall. It was learnt that the Principal’s fate was sealed after she had a minor argument with the Commissioner. It was also gathered that no query was given to the principal, in line with the Civil Service rules. The Principal could not be reached for comments at the time of filing the report. However, one of the teachers in the school accused Oviawe of deploying intimidation to keep the demoted Principal in check and weaken solidarity against the ‘unpopular decision’. Reacting to the incident via a text message, the Commissioner for Education, Joan Oviawe, challenged the demoted Principal to disclose details of what happened. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
