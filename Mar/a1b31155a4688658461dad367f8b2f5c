Ahead of the 2023 general election, the Young Progressives Party has vowed to massively mobilise votes for the candidates of the party to take over governance in the country. The National Secretary of the party, Vidiyeno Bamaiyi, said this in Ilorin, Kwara State while monitoring the conduct of the ward and local government congresses of the party in the state. Speaking with journalists at the Adewole ward of Ilorin West Local Government Area of the state, he said the party will take over the leadership of the country in 2023. Bamaiyi said the party has embarked on ‘ballot revolution’ ahead of the 2023 general elections with massive sensitization of young people to change the narratives. He also explained that the ‘ballot revolution’ is not a bloody one but all about preparing the minds of young people in the country to get into mainstream politics and supporting them to take over the political leadership at all levels through the ballot box with their voter cards and determination to change the old guards. Bamaiyi said that the peaceful and orderly manner in which the party conducted its ward and local government elections and inauguration demonstrated its readiness to take over in 2023. “We are going to shock the nation in 2023 because we are for new breed progressive politicians. I am also happy that we have a large population of women with us. “YPP had the largest registration of women in politics, progressive youths as party members and we saying no to all old brigade politicians,” Bamaiyi said. He called on the youths to take their destiny into their hands by registering for the permanent voter cards which will allow them to participate in the 2023 elections. Copyright PUNCH.
