THE Director-General of the National Research Institute for Chemical Technology, Prof. Jeffrey Barminas, says indigenous chemical technology will create jobs and enhance import-substitution as well as investments in the country. He said this at the Chemical Technology special day at the ongoing STI EXPO in Abuja. This was contained in a statement issued by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation on Wednesday. The NARICT DG was quoted as saying, “Our strength and visibility in the development of indigenous technologies in the chemical sector is an asset that could bring jobs and import substitution as well as attract significant inward investment in areas such as agro-processing, light manufacturing, energy, environment, health etc. He also said, “Smart new strategies for designing, producing and using safer chemicals to minimize risks and prevent pollution are a priority as captured in our mandate.” He described the expo as an investor/inventor forum, enabling discussion on how best to deliver sustainable long-term growth for the Chemical Industry in the country.
