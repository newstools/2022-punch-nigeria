The Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said his administration is committed to improving transportation in the state. Sanwo-Olu disclosed this on Wednesday during a working visit to Eti-Osa. He said, “We have completed the redesign of the first and second Lekki roundabouts, as well as Abraham Adesanya roundabout, as part of our statewide junction improvement efforts, aimed at easing the flow of traffic at critical points. “Our commitment to improving journey times and commuting experience for all Lagosians remains unwavering. In water transportation, we have acquired new ferry boats to ease water transportation and connect Eti-Osa with other parts of Lagos State. “Eti-Osa, as the name implies, is blessed with proximity to the Lagoon, which is a transportation asset that we are committed to utilising maximally, for your benefit.” The governor added that the new market built in the area would improve its commercial opportunities. “This new Sangotedo market built by Eti-Osa Local Council Development Areas will no doubt bring improved commercial opportunities to several communities in this area, and it is my hope and expectation that this will translate into higher earnings, more jobs, and better standards of living for you all,” he said.
