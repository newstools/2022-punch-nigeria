Geely Nigeria, the exclusive partnership between Mikano International and Geely Autos, has announced plans to launch a brand new SUV soon. A company statement said the global auto giant, since its establishment of operations in Nigeria, has had an exemplary run towards establishing itself as one of the fastest-growing auto brands in the country. In February, Geely Global reported an impressive 78,478 sales volume worldwide, a clear indication for the brand in Nigeria. Shortly before this, in 2021, it was announced that Geely was the only Asian automaker to join the International Automotive Task Force, joining other members such as BMW Group, Volkswagen AG and Jaguar Land Rover Limited. While leveraging Mikano International’s formidable legacy, Mikano Motors launched Geely Nigeria with the introduction of the X7Sport and Emgrand7 models with commendable success. This was quickly followed by the launch of the Coolray SUV, which won the award for “Best Compact SUV- Design and Technology 2021” by the Nigerian Auto Journalists Association. The statement further said, ”From all indications, Mikano Motors-Geely Nigeria, is set to shake up the Nigerian auto-industry once again with this innovative, game-changing addition. The information released to us so far proves to us that the new entrant is a C- Segment, hybrid SUV, luxurious, technology and ensures safety that’s what Geely is known for. This SUV like the Coolray before it was co-developed with Volvo Autos, which Geely took ownership of in 2010.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
