Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has directed the state Commissioner of Police; the Commander, 35 Artillery Brigade; and the Director, Department of State Services, to relocate their operations to the Sagamu area of the state and apprehend those involved in the recent cult activities in the town. Abiodun, in a statement on Tuesday in Abeokuta by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, charged the security agencies to bring the culprits to book. No fewer than eight persons were killed on Monday in Sagamu during a supremacy battle between two rival cults, Eiye and Aiye confraternities. The killings happened a few days after seven persons were murdered in various places in Abeokuta, the state capital. While condemning the killings, the governor called on residents of Sagamu to cooperate with security agents to rid the town and its environs of cultists and other criminal elements. The statement read in part, “Our youths must resist the temptation to go into cultism and similar vices. “They should not endanger that future by getting involved in crime. “Parents and guardians must also ensure that their children and wards stay away from criminality. “We have zero tolerance for anything that can disturb the peace we have been enjoying in Ogun State since the commencement of this administration. “We will deal decisively with anyone intent on disturbing that peace.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
