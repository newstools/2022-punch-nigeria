Striker Victor Osimhen says Napoli’s 1-0 loss to AC Milan hurt the team but believes they’re still confident of fighting for the 2021/22 Serie A title. Milan got the better of the Partenopei with Olivier Giroud getting the only goal of the encounter in the 49th minute to hand Napoli their fifth loss of the season as they (Milan) moved top of the league table two points ahead of neigbours Inter and three points ahead of Napoli. Napoli will visit Hellas Verona on Sunday with hopes of returning to winning ways and the Nigeria international believes the Scudetto is in sight and they are ready to fight till the end. “The Scudetto? Of course we believe in it. Even the fans must continue to believe in it despite the defeat against Milan,” Osimhen told Radio Kiss Kiss Napoli. “We are aware of our strength and we continue to hope for the best. I believe in it a lot. We know that from now to the end of the season we will face many difficult matches but we still believe in it.” Osimhen also revealed that the loss to Milan last weekend hurt the team and believed they should have gotten a penalty in the first half. “The defeat against Milan hurt us. We didn’t play a great game but of course we are aware that we played against a strong team. “We analysed the game in depth and the mistakes we made in order to correct them, but I repeat that it was a hard defeat to digest.” “Obviously it was a foul. I didn’t try to simulate because if I had I would have got a yellow card. I expected the referee to go to VAR, but he didn’t. It’s a shame, but it’s okay. It’s a pity but it’s okay, the referee’s decision was different and we have to accept it.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
