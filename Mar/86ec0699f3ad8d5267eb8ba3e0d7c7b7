The All Progressives Congress has said no leadership change has been effected in the Caretaker/Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party. National Publicity Secretary, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, disclosed this in a statement on Monday. This means the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, remains the Chairman of the APC-CECPC. The statement read, “Our attention has been drawn to sponsored media reports on an imaginary leadership change in the APC- CECPC “The media report is fake news and should be disregarded. “The APC is a progressive political party guided by rules. Leadership changes are not announced by ‘sources’ through name dropping in the media. “We urge our teeming supporters, members and indeed the general public to remain calm and support the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led APC CECPC conduct a rancour-free and credible National Convention deserving of our great party.” This is amid crisis rocking the party which saw the Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Sani Bello, presiding over a meeting of the APC-CECPC, at the National Secretariat of the party, on Monday.
