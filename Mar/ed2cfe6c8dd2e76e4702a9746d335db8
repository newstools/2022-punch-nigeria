One million refugees have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said in a tweet Wednesday evening. “In just seven days we have witnessed the exodus of one million refugees from Ukraine to neighbouring countries,” Grandi said, according to CNN. “For many millions more, inside Ukraine, it’s time for guns to fall silent, so that life-saving humanitarian assistance can be provided,” he added. South Korea is relocating its embassy in Ukraine from Kyiv to a “safe area,” the country’s Foreign Ministry said Wednesday as Russian troops step up their assault on the Ukrainian capital. The ministry did not disclose the embassy’s destination, citing safety reasons. The embassy will resume operations once it settles down in the new location, the ministry said. South Korea’s Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba by phone on Wednesday, according to the ministry.
