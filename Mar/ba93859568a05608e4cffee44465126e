The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps on Friday said no fewer than 30 persons have been arrested over their alleged involvement in illegal marketing of petrol in Gombe State. The Commandant of NSCDC in the state, Waziri Baba-Goni, who disclosed this in the state capital, according to the News Agency of Nigeria, said the activities of the suspects were hindering the efforts of the Federal Government as well as relevant agencies to ensure availability of petrol at the stipulated price. Baba-Goni, however, said the suspect had been granted bail, “having signed undertakings, and would be charged to court soon. “We have informants and we carry out night surveillance which we will continue to do until sanity returns to the system,” he added. On the allegation by the state chapter of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria that NSCDC officials were escorting its members, Baba-Goni said his Command would take legal action against IPMAN. According to him, the NSCDC has zero tolerance for corruption and would not accept any attempt to dent its image. “There was a statement from an IPMAN official that we will collect money from him. This is a dent on NSCDC and we will not take that. It is either he brings the officer he gave money to or we will take him to court because we will not allow a single individual to dent the image of this command,” he added.
