Meanwhile, in 2020, the total power generated stood at 35,720Gw while electricity transmitted across the country was 35,029Gw. This implies that the total volume of power generated in the country rose by 677Gw or two per cent in 2021. A breakdown of the power generated in 2020 shows that in Q1, 8,560Gw was generated, out of which, 8,390Gw was transmitted. In Q2, 2020, the volume of electricity generated rose by 2.76 percent to 8,797Gw, while 8,620Gwh was transmitted. In Q3, 2020, 8,693Gw of electricity was generated, accounting for 1.18 per cent decline from the preceding quarter, while 8,530Gw was transmitted under the same period. However, in Q4 2020, the volume of electricity generated increased by 11.21 per cent with 9,668Gw compared to Q3, 2020. Subsequently, 9,487.99Gwh was transmitted during the same period. Meanwhile, in Q1, 2021, 9,717.81Gw of electricity was generated, while 9,519Gw was transmitted. In Q2, 2021, electricity generated stood at 8,917Gw which shows a decline of 8.23 percent compared to Q1, 2021. In addition, electricity transmitted during the quarter stood at 8,728Gw “Furthermore, electricity generated in Q3, 2021 decreased by 2.62 percent recording 8,684.50 (Gwh) while under the same period 8,510.84 (Gwh) was transmitted. “However, electricity generated in Q4, 2021 rose by 4.53 percent with 9,077.80 (Gwh) compared to Q3, 2021, while 8,894.97 (Gwh) was transmitted. “In general, total generation in 2021, stood at 36,397.92 (Gwh), while 35,654.43 (Gwh) was transmitted,” the NBS added.
