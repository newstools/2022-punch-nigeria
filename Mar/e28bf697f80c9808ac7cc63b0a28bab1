The Lagos State Government has said it has upgraded the Ilera Eko health scheme by increasing the maximum age of dependents in a family for residents of the state. According to a statement on Sunday, the General Manager, Lagos State Health Management Agency, Dr Emmanuella Zamba, disclosed this during a courtesy visit by the Nigeria Union of Journalists (Lagos State Information Chapel) in Ikeja. She said, “As part of strategies to reduce the financial burden on enrolees of Ilera Eko health scheme, the state government has increased the maximum age of dependents in a family package from 18 years to 23 years given that there are still some children who are above 18 years old but still stay with their parents. “Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has also graciously approved that public servants should have EkoTelemed as a complement to their Ilera Eko standard plan free of charge while other Lagos residents will pay N3, 000 per annum to enjoy EkoTelemed. A lot of initiatives have been developed by the LASHMA since it started operations to enlighten residents on the benefits of health insurance in Lagos.” The Chairman, NUJ, Lagos State Information Chapel, Adebowale Adeniji, commended the government for its commitment to the well-being of citizens. “We have been seeing a lot of the vulnerable coming on board Ilera Eko and having access to care in the various hospitals of their choice. This is a good testimony that the state government cares for the good health and well-being of the residents of the state,” he said.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
