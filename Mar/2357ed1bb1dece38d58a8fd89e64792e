Borno State Government on Wednesday confirmed the abduction of one Mr Bulama Geidam, a health worker assigned to the General Hospital Gubio, Borno state, by the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP). The ISWAP insurgents attacked Gubio early hours of Wednesday, carting away a load of food items and fuel from a humanitarian truck. The State Commissioner for Health, Juliana Bitruce, who confirmed the abduction to the NAN in Maiduguri, described the incident as “unfortunate and disturbing”. According to her, the said abducted health worker was among those who remained at their duty posts despite the palpable insecurity within the area. “The ministry will write to officially inform all the concerned security agencies, including the Theater Command, Operation Hadin Kai,” she said. The commissioner prayed for the safe release of the health worker. However, residents who fled for safety during the midnight assault had returned to their homes, following the insurgents’ withdrawal from the area. NAN
