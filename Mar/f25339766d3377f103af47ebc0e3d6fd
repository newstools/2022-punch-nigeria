The All Progressives Congress Youth Lobby Group has congratulated the newly elected National Women Leader of the party, Dr. Betta Edu. The group, in a statement issued by its Cross River Chairman, Oden Ewa, in Abuja on Sunday, described Edu’s victory as a victory for all women, including those who had aspired for the same office. “We feel very elated, and once again, fulfilled, that one of us, young, intelligent, and exceptionally diligent Edu is the National Women Leader of our great party. “This feat has further reinforced our firm belief that the future is now. Dr. Edu is one of our shining lights and will continue to remain so by the grace of God,” the group said. The group expressed confidence that she would carry everyone along and further create opportunities for other women to achieve their goals. The group urged every party woman to give maximum support to Edu, to enable her succeed in her new national role. It equally thanked Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River for believing in Edu who had not only diligently, but, auspiciously served him as Commissioner for Health, adding that the governor would continue to be a huge inspiration to millions of young people across the country and beyond. “Thank you for believing in Cross River youths; thank you for giving us the inspiration, mentorship, privilege, opportunity and platform to soar; thank you for leading us to the future we have always desired. “It has always not been about you but about your people, right from day one. We, the youths, have been the biggest beneficiary of your kind magnanimity,” the statement read in part. NAN
