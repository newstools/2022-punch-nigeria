Lovonus Microfinance Bank says it has surpassed the Central Bank of Nigeria’s N200m share capital requirement for Tier-one MfBs to become state-licensed microfinance banks. The Chairman of the bank, Mr Alfred Okoigun, disclosed this on Sunday in Lagos at an event to mark the bank’s 10th anniversary. He stated that the bank started operations in 2012 with a paid-up share capital of N20m and has grown this to N200m in 10 years. He said, “We started with a paid-up share capital of N20m in 2012. Today we have surpassed the share of N200m before the deadline by the ending of April 2022 for the tier-one microfinance bank set by the CBN to become a state-licensed microfinance bank.” Copyright PUNCH.
