A copy of the letter which was acknowledged by the office of the EFCC boss and sighted by our correspondent, the group accused the APC of using funds meant for Nigerians to bribe party executives. The petition added that the APC in the state had “continued to show brazen corruption and lawlessness” The group claimed that there was video evidence showing Sani promising to share NIRSAL COVID-19 loans to APC party delegates.
