An Ilorin Magistrate Court has ordered the remand of one Yakubu Ahmed, a student of Kinsey College of Education, Ilorin in a Federal Correctional Service Centre for allegedly causing the death of his friend, Farouq Ahmed. According to Police First Information Report, the friends engaged in physical combat during which they used knives to inflict various degrees of injuries upon each other during a squabble recently around the school premises. They were reportedly rushed to the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital but Ahmed later died while receiving treatment, Police have alleged. Police report revealed that the fight ensued as a result of missing plates that were kept in the custody of the deceased. The Prosecutor, Samuel Adebisi urged the court to remand the accused person in Custody pending further hearing of the case as the alleged offence of Culpable homicide under which he was charged was not bailable. He prayed the Court to grant another date for hearing pending the outcome of legal advice from the Ministry of Justice. The Magistrate, Mr Adebayo Kudus, in his short ruling, said he can only take cognisance of the case but lack jurisdiction to entertain it. He however adjourned the matter till 21st March, 2022 for mention. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
