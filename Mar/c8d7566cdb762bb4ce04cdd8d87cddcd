Osun State Government on Friday launched Business Uplifting Fund, an initiative tagged ‘GBOWOGA’ under which 10,000 petty traders, artisans, students and people with disabilities would receive a sum of N10,000 each. Speaking in Osogbo during the event, Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, explained that GBOWOGA Fund was a tripartite arrangement that involved state government, Office of the Wife of the Governor and Messrs Peculiar Ultimate Concerns, which donated through the Social Responsibility Service of the company. Oyetola also said the initiative would boost businesses of the beneficiaries and reduce poverty level, adding that the money was expected to be credited directly to the account of each beneficiary. He said, “Through this programme, the sum of N100m will be distributed to ten thousand petty traders, artisans, and market women, groups, among others in the State to boost their businesses and reduce poverty level to the barest minimum.
