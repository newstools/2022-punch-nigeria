Adeyinka Oladimeji, the mother of popular twins, Twinxlove, takes us on her mothering journey over the years. She spoke of how she dumped her daughters at the request of their father but couldn’t leave them,  having no help from family and her husband, having to dump her nursing career, all for the sake of her children. The skit makers, Moyin and Doyin, also shared the story of how they grew up without a dad, being molested by their landlord’s son and more. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
