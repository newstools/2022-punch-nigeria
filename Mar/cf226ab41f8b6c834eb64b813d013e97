Gunmen, suspected to be herdsmen, have kidnapped two siblings who were on their way to the burial of their father in the Ekuku-Agbor area of Delta State. The PUNCH gathered that the two siblings were coming to their father’s burial on Friday when the gunmen accosted them and whisked them away. A family source told our correspondent that the suspected Fulani herdsmen demanded N13 million in ransom. “Mr Chukwuyem Afam, a son to late Sunday Afam whose burial was slated for Saturday, March 26, 2022, at Ekuku-Agbor, and one of their in-laws, Mr Eric Etunim, who was called up to come and pick up Mr Afam from the train station at Owa Oyibu. “They were driving to Ekuku-Agbor when they were accosted by kidnappers, they were Fulani herdsmen who shot sporadically into the air, before they were whisked away. “Mr Chukwuyem travelled down from Abuja on Friday for the burial of his father and called on one of their in-laws, Mr Etunim to pick him up but unfortunately they were kidnapped. “They had contacted the family with an initial demand of N13 million ransom, which they later brought down to N5 million per person based on their last contact,” the family source said. He lamented that the burial ceremony of the late Afam turned into a very painful ordeal as the family members went ahead to bury their father since they have fixed the date amidst anxiety and apprehension. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Bright Edafe said he was yet to get information as of the time of filing this report. He said, “I have not gotten information on the incident, I will find out and get back to you.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
