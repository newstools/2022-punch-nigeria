THE Enugu State Directorate office of the Nigeria Copyright Commission has shut down Real Summit Television Network for allegedly rebroadcasting copyright-protected content to residents of Nsukka and its environs. The assistant Director Operation, NCC, Mr Okwudili Macfoy, told journalists that the station was neither licensed by the commission nor by the Nigeria Communication Commission during a broadcast anti-piracy operation on Thursday. The commission also arrested three staff members of the network and confiscated thousands of equipment, including over 70 different decoders of various cable networks and computers. Speaking to our correspondent shortly on the sidelines, the State Director of the Commission, Mrs Okeke Ngozi, said, “The operation today is an outcome of a campaign that the Commission had been carrying over a period of time against privacy, the campaign against theft, the campaign against laziness, the campaign against robbing Peter to pay Paul. It is a campaign also we have been carrying against destroying the economy of the country. “You have seen what happened at Nsukka, when they do all these things, we tell them it is better you channel your resources and investment in the right place because no matter how long it takes the long arm of the law will surely catch up with them. “You know in their mind they will be thinking that they are having a field day, they will be smiling at the bank to the detriment of others. We as a Commission are not in a hurry but no matter how long it takes we will surely get at them and we will charge them and that is exactly what you have seen that happened today.” Copyright PUNCH.
