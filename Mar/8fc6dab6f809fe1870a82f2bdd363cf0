A group, led by Aree Miyiwa Akinboro (SAN), have purchased the Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms for Aminu Tambuwal, to contest in the Peoples Democratic Party presidential primary ahead of the 2023 election. This comes barely 24 hours after a former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, officially threw his hat in the ring to become the flagbearer of the PDP in the presidential election. The PDP had commenced the sales of forms on March 17, pegging the nomination and expression of interest forms for the presidential aspirants at N5 million and N35million respectively. Akinboro, speaking on behalf of the group after it was presented with the forms by the Organising Secretary of the PDP, Hon Umar Bature, said there have been questions if the Sokoto State Governor had the money to pursue his dreams, hence their decision to purchase it for him. He added that the issue of zoning elective positions in the PDP should come after the election, stating that the party needed to put its best foot forward to contest and win the elections. “Tambuwal is someone we have all known for 30 years and nothing has changed about him. He’s humble, focused and intelligent. “People ask if he has the money to pursue this ambition. That is why we are here to buy this form for him. He’s not aware but we as professional and apolitical, we want him to lead. “As regards zoning, we believe Tambuwal is a native of Nigeria and this is someone who is at home in all parts of the nation. Just look at us, we have Yoruba, Igbo, Ibibio, and we are saying, PDP, put your best foot forward. You can see there are no money bags here, but the little we have, we will use for him,” Akinboro stated. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
