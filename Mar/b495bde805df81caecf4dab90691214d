Chancellor of the Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Dr David Oyedepo, has advised the matriculating students of the school to work hard at achieving success in their academic pursuits. Oyedepo said this during the 12th matriculation of the school held at Omu-Aran. “Individually work out your success as it is not transferrable from parents. Note that success is not transferrable. “Even Abraham could not bequeath greatness to his son Isaac. Isaac too could not transfer greatness to his son, Jacob who had to struggle on his own to fulfil his destiny. Success is an offspring of serious-minded individuals” He explained that the four high-selling custom-built programs of the school, including Total Man Concept, Entrepreneurial Studies, Agripreneurship, and Towards a Total Graduate were aimed at promoting the Man-child model of education, to lead to accelerated maturity, spiritually, intellectually and in entrepreneurship. In her address at the ceremony, the pro-chancellor of the institution, Pastor Faith Oyedepo, said Landmark University was a centre for qualitative learning and character moulding. She enjoined the students to be focused, saying capacity building would be needed, not only at Landmark University, but throughout their lifetime. While speaking at the ceremony, the acting Vice-Chancellor of Landmark University, Prof. Charity Aremu, stated that over 3,000 graduates of Landmark University were making exploits in their fields. The registrar of the university, Miss Adefunke Oyinloye, counselled the students to be solution providers, new generation leaders, reformers and pathfinders.” Over 600 undergraduate and 60 postgraduate students matriculated at the ceremony.
