A governorship aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party in Benue State, Mr Terve Akase, on Tuesday, faulted provision of the amended constitution that stipulates that anyone who lives in a place for five years becomes an automatic indigene of such a place. In a statement made available to our correspondent in Makurdi, Akase called on State Houses of Assembly to reject the provision of the constitution amendment whenever it is sent to them. Akase, the immediate past Chief Press Secretary to Governor Samuel Ortom described the indigeneship clause as another plot to grab lands from Nigerians. He said, “The only way to escape this is for the State Houses of Assembly to vote a resounding no against the controversial provision.” He warned that if allowed, Nigerians would in no distant time lose their land to foreigners. “Do you know that the constitutional amendment recently carried out by the National Assembly has a provision which stipulates that anyone who lives in a place for about five years automatically becomes an indigene of such a place? “This means that someone will come to settle on your father’s land and when he stays there for five years, he can claim the land for himself, having by law become an indigene. “The plot to grab lands from Nigerians is not going away any time soon. This time, it is clothed with the robe of addressing the indigeneship question. But the hidden motive is different. Ruga it is,” he submitted. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
