The National Assembly management has barred workers from lobbying lawmakers to influence their postings and deployments, threatening to sanction those who flout the public service rules. The warning was contained in a circular signed by the Diretor, Directorate of Human Resources and Staff Development, Abiodun Oladoyin, and dated July 1, 2022. The circular, a copy of which our correspondent sighted on Tuesday, was addressed to the Deputy Clerk to the National Assembly; Clerk to the Senate; Clerk to the House of Representatives; all Secretaries; Deputy Clerk to the Senate; Deputy Clerk to the House; all Directors and all staff members. The circular titled, ‘Posting/Redeployment of Staff,’ partly read, “The management of the National Assembly has observed with great concern staff members soliciting assistance from legislators to influence their posting/redeployment to and from different directorates of their choice. “Consequently, staff (members) are advised to strictly abide by Public Service Rules, PSR 030427 which states that ‘No officer shall seek the influence of prominent persons or any other for ensuring the due consideration of his/her claims in matters connected with discipline or with a view to obtaining consideration for appointment, transfer, promotion or posting.’”
