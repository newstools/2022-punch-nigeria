A Lagos State-based automation and control solutions company, Fuelmetrics Limited, has developed a product, Gensys, for tracking and managing the consumption of fuel in the country. The company’s Head of Marketing, Folake Opanubi, in a statement on Wednesday, said the Gensys solution was designed to help users easily identify gaps in fuel consumption and put in place adequate measures for system check. Opanubi said, “Fuel management and consumption is increasingly becoming an issue of concern in Nigeria. From the constant hike in prices, to the shortage in power supply, to mismanagement and pilferage within systems and organisations, household and enterprises, are constantly complaining about how pocket draining this can be. “Gensys, an offshoot of Fuelmetrics’ flagship product, Epump, has been specially built to empower facility and resident owners that make use of generator tanks to adequately monitor their fuel delivery and consumption process with ease. “To launch the Gensys solution, an Automatic Tank Gauge probe is installed in the tank to take stock of the available product, and a Console in the utility office for management. The system then captures the fuel storage volume and temperature in tank in real-time and transmits it to the cloud via the Console on site. “Data collated is accessible anytime from anywhere on the web-based dashboard or through downloadable reports to ensure accurate information at the disposal of the customer. “In addition, customers can order for fuel on the Gensys platform from credible fuel suppliers and deliver to them. They can track the price and delivery status of their order through real-time data, and get a detailed insight into their consumption process.”
