The Mountain of Holy Ghost Intervention and Deliverance Ministry, presided over by Prophet Chukwuemeka Ohanaemere alias ‘Odumeje’ in Onitsha, has cleared the air on the demolition of property which took place in the church vicinity. Contrary to reports that the church building was demolished by the Anambra State Task Force on Thursday, the church body has stated that the news was false, adding that only the security post and fence were affected. In a video posted on Odumeje’s official Instagram page, an aide of the cleric noted that the church building was intact and activities will continue as usual. A voice speaking in the video said, “The rumour is going viral that Odumeje’s church has been demolished. This is contrary to what happened. That is false. “Odumeje’s church has not been demolished but the security house at the front of Odumeje’s church. “The security house that is a little bit close to the drainage was demolished. As you can see, Odumeje’s church is still intact.” The video also showed the section of the security post that was demolished, and the interiors of the church which were still in good shape. The church, also known as Land of Freedom, has been tagged “illegal building” by the State Government and earlier marked for demolition for encroaching on a huge canal. Members of the state task force stormed the location on Thursday to enforce the demolition and there was a face-off between the pastor and some of the task force members. It was gathered that security men had tried to whisk the pastor away after he was trying to resist the demolition activities.
