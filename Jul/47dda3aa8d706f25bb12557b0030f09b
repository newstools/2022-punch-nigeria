There was tension in Udo Idiong Junction in Obio Okpa campus of the Akwa Ibom State University, OrukAnam local government area of the state, as a roadside petrol dealer on Sunday set ablaze one Enwongo Akpan, a 200-level philosophy student of the institution, over a minor disagreement. It was gathered that trouble started when the student unknowingly bought adulterated fuel of N500 only from the dealer who is now on the run. The victim returned the adulterated fuel to the dealer after he emptied the content into his generating set tank but the engine did not ignite. An eyewitness, Idongesit Akpan, told newsmen on Monday that in the ensuing argument, the dealer made for the petrol gallon and poured it content on his victim and struck a match on him before he caught fire while others scampered for safety . Akpan further stated that the victim was rescued by the villagers and students who alerted the Vice Chancellor of the University Prof Nse Essien who ordered that the victim be rushed to Mercy Hospital in Abak, where he received treatment before being transferred to another hospital in Uyo, the state capital. Akpan said, “The incident attracted attention of community leaders such as former Chairman of OrukAnam, Prince Ubong Idiong, who prevailed on students to forestall reprisal action by students of the University . “The victim was later transferred to another hospital in Uyo for better treatment.” The Police Public Relations Officer of the Akwa Ibom State Police command, Odiko Macdon, who confirmed the incident said the Commissioner of Police, Olatoye Dorusinmi, has ordered investigation into the matter, adding that the suspect would soon be arrested. He said, “Yes, we are aware of the incident. But the suspect escaped from the scene. Police are trailing the suspect now and he will soon be brought to book.”
