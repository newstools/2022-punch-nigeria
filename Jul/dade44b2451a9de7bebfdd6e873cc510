The Atiku Amalgamated Support Group on Friday berated the legal luminary, Ebun Adegboruwa, SAN, over his recent statement against the presidential aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar. The PUNCH had earlier reported that Adegboruwa said there was no major difference among the presidential candidates of the PDP, the All Progressives Congress, and the Labour Party; Bola Tinubu, Atiku Abubakar, and Peter Obi respectively. He claimed that the three candidates did not truly represent the aspirations of the masses but were leveraging the dissatisfaction of the masses. In a statement by the AASG on Friday, the group said that the SAN’s “arguments is beneath the reputation of an attorney and especially of one who goes about in the name of a constitutional lawyer.” The statement read in part, “It is with a very high sense of disappointment that I read the statement of Barrister Ebun Adegboruwa on the 2023 presidential election as it relates to the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar. “It would have been more honourable for Adegboruwa to use the constitution of Nigeria as the ground norm of his arguments instead of leaning on emotional discharge to query the circumstances in which His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar, is contesting the 2023 presidential election. As far as the law is concerned, (which should be Adegboruwa’s business) Atiku is qualified to vie for the position of President in the upcoming elections.”
