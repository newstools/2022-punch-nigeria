I was once paid to insult Tinubu during the protests. That was a long time ago. Now, APC has said Akoi Tinubu. “If they pay you, do your job, no ripping. When I was asked to insult Tinubu, I collected my money and did my job. Now Tinubu is the next. They’re the ones that gave me money, and I must do the work for the money I collected. Akoi APC,” he said in Yoruba.
