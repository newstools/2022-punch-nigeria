The Assistant Inspector-General of Police in charge of Force Intelligent Bureau, Habu Sani, has cried out for the need to recruit more people into the Nigeria Police Force to effectively police the ever-increasing insecurity in the country.
 
He made this call on Wednesday in Minna, while representing the Inspector-General of Police, Alkali Baba, during the Passing out Parade of the 2020 recruit constables.
 
He said there seemed to be no end to the issue of insecurity in the country adding that the police were overwhelmed. He urged parents to encourage their children to join the police force to help control armed banditry, Boko-Haram, and other gunmen. “It is important for parents and guardians to encourage their wards to apply for and join the NPF, doing so has become necessary because of the dimension of Nigeria’s security concerns and the need to guarantee credible policing,” he said. Representing Governor Abubarkar Sani Bello, the Commissioner for Internal Security, Emmanuel Umar, said the state was in dire need of more policing hands to guarantee the security of lives of citizenry. “With the current security situation we have found ourselves in, we are in dire need of more hands to check the excesses of these terrorists. The Assistant Commissioner of Police, Aloko Amodu, in a welcome address, said the 422 recruit constables; 374 males and 48 females were trained for six months in collaboration with the Federal Government according to best global practices in modern security.
