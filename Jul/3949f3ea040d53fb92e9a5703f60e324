Trophy Extra Stout says it has launched a new thematic campaign called ‘No DNA needed, originally black’. According to a statement, the new thematic campaign was targeted at celebrating exceptional leadership and originality traits in Nigerians and Africans by extension. The statement said the novelty pro-identity campaign titled, ‘No DNA Needed’ was built on the ideology ‘The Originals.’ Speaking at the launch, the Marketing Director, International Breweries Plc, Tolulope Adedeji, said, “People ask why we chose the name ‘No DNA Needed, Originally Black’. It is an inborn attribute of Africans to be natural leaders. Leadership is taken very seriously in Africa and this is taught to the child from birth to adulthood. “The typical Nigerian believes he or she is capable of anything they want to do. They never have to prove their identity and do not need a DNA test to identify themselves anywhere they go. The growing need to ensure the black identity is not lost gave birth to this preposition and our new personality – the Modern Leader.” “These Modern rulers are top of their games, with followership that is legendary.”
