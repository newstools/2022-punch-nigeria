Nigerians on Twitter have showered praises on international music artiste, Bukola Elemide, popularly known as Asa, for her performance at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Tuesday. Dressed in a sombre all-black attire, Asa performed her song, ‘Fire On The Mountain,’ at the launch of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited. On Tuesday, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation transited fully into a commercial entity, becoming the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited. Several high-ranking public servants including the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), were in attendance. Released in 2007, ‘Fire on the Mountain’ is a rebuke of African leaders and their lackadaisical attitude toward the plight of the common man. Many took to social media to applaud Asa for performing the satire at the event. Hailing the singer, @Naijspider tweeted, “The best song for the occasion. There’s fire on the mountain and this government seems not to be on the run to put it out. Just chilling like all is well.” “Imagine Paying Asa to perform but you are getting a protest via her ‘Fire on the Mountain’ song and yet the regressive group doesn’t get it! Asa. We hear you loud and clear,” @rizzza wrote. @Reneult_Jabosss also tweeted, “I was shocked that Asa performed ‘Fire on the mountain’ right in front of Buhari & all the government dignitaries present at the NNPC Limited launch. “That was brave and courageous on her part. Speaking truth to power. Music is a powerful weapon indeed. Asa, you did well!” “@Asa_official wearing an all-black attire and singing ‘there is fire on the mountain’ in front of the Head of State is the kind of African giant activism I love to see. A Queen!” @Chinokevic wrote. @Asa_official performing ‘Fire on the Mountain’ at the NNPC LTD unveiling is such a direct message to the leaders of the country right in their face,” @kryssthaboss tweeted.
