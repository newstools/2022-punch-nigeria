The Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria, on Friday, called off its three days warning strike after resolving issues as regards workers’ remuneration with APM Terminal, Apapa. The President-General, the MWUN, Adewale Adeyanju, confirmed the development to our journalists on Friday. Adeyanju disclosed that the union and the terminal operator reached an agreement in resolving some issues with the Collective Bargaining Agreement. He confirmed that workers are to resume operational activities at the terminal with immediate effect. He also commended management of the Nigerian Ports Authority and the Nigerian Shippers’ Council for the prompt intervention to save the nation’s economy from collapse. He, however, reiterated the union’s commitment towards ensuring industrial peace and harmony in the shipping industry. The leadership of the dockworkers had, on Wednesday, shut down the terminal alleging refusal of the terminal operator to review the workers’ CBA which is usually reviewed annually.
