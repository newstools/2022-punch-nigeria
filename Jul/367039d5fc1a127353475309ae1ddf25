Owa Obokun of Ijesaland, Oba Adekunle Aromolaran, on Tuesday, said Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has performed well in office and would record victory in the July 16 poll, particularly within his domain. The monarch spoke in his palace in Ilesa when the campaign team of the All Progressives Congress, led by the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu visited him. Oba Aromolaran who lauded Oyetola over his tremendous achievements across sectors noted that he had been rated high among other candidates based on his track records. He further said, “You are the incumbent governor, but you have proved yourself with your satisfactory performance. You have not disappointed us in any way, and your emergence is not doubtful, especially among my people. “Whoever stands by God will never fail. We thank you Mr. Governor for all you have done for us and we thank you for what you will be doing in your second term. “We are not known for dilly-dallying in our collective history, and it won’t start in our disposition towards you. In other words, we will not disappoint you.  We are united with you in purpose and developmental intentions, and that is why we are standing by you now, and we will stand by you with our votes. “The whole of Ijesaland and Osun are proud of you because you are a true Excellency who knows the value of education, good health system, and other critical indices of development. I don’t want to talk too much than to thank you.” A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to Osun governor, Ismail Omipidan, noted that Oyetola, while addressing APC supporters at the rally held in Ilesa, tasked them to double their efforts of mobilisation, urging those that have not collected their Permanent Voter Cards to do so without further delay.
