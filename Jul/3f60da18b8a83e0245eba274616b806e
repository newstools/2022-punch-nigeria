THE Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has said his administration will go tough on any commercial motorcyclists who refuse to register with the state government. He said the registration of commercial motorcycles and their riders became important to prevent terrorists and other criminals disguising as Okada riders from operating in the state. Makinde, who spoke through his Executive Assistant on Administration and General Services, Idowu Ogedengbe, said this in Ibadan on Monday while featuring on the platform of the Oyo State Correspondents’ Chapel of Nigeria Union of Journalists. He explained that the registration included the biometric data capturing for all operators including their names, phone numbers and addresses. The governor’s aide said the Oyo State Road Transport Management Authority had been directed to apprehend whoever refused to register. He stressed that the first thing any commercial motorcyclist had to do before starting operation in the state was to get registered.
