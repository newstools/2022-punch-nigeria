The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Friday, extended the condolences of the Nigerian government to the family of a former Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and the people of Japan over his gruesome assassination. Abe, 67, died after being shot during a speech in Nara, Japan, on Friday. In a statement signed by his Special Adviser, Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari said Abe would be remembered for his unwavering commitment to strengthening trade and investment between Africa and Japan through various initiatives and partnerships, using the instrumentality of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development. According to the statement, titled, “President Buhari commiserates with Japan on tragic death of former Prime Minister,” Buhari joined “all Japanese in mourning the loss of the country’s longest-serving prime minister and outstanding leader.” He assured Abe’s family of the prayers and thoughts of all Nigerians during this difficult time. The President also affirms that under Abe, Nigeria and Japan enjoyed a strategic partnership, supporting each other’s shared aspirations on economic cooperation, healthcare, human resource development, disaster risk reduction, peace, and security. He, therefore, prayed that the memory of the Japanese statesman and respected international leader would be a blessing to his nation and people, whom he served so devotedly.
