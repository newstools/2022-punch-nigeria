No fewer than 4,985 road accidents in the last seven years were recorded, the Federal Road Safety Corps said on Thursday. According to the FRSC, the accidents occurred between 2014 and 2021. The Corps Marshal, Boboye Oyeyemi, made this known during his first valedictory lecture titled ‘My Stewardship’. He stated, “Road traffic crashes from 2014-2021 were 4,985 which includes; number of fatal crashes 1,425, serious crashes 2,848, and number of minor crashes 712. “Prior to 2014, the total number of crashes recorded was 13,583. Due to innovations in operational activities of the corps, there was a significant decrease from the year 2014 to 2017 while there was a slight increase in the total number of crashes recorded in years 2018 to 2021.” The FRSC boss ascribed the reduction in road crashes to the agency’s expansion via the establishment of outpost commands and station offices in 764 local government areas nationwide except riverine areas. Oyeyemi, who is the longest serving corps marshal, said 10,410 officials were recruited during his eight-year tenure. He added that a total of 10,403 officers and 25,671 marshals were promoted. He also revealed that during his tenure, the corps recovered 365 stolen vehicles across the states. The corps marshal added, “From 2014-2022, during patrol operations, a total of 5,269,645 vehicles were stopped, out of which 4,306,328 were booked. “Out of this number, 963,317 were cautioned, enlightened and discharged.”
