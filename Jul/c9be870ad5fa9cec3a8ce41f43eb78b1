The All Progressives Congress deputy governorship candidate in Taraba, Illiyasu Kirim, on Thursday, assured stakeholders and his supporters that the crisis in the state’s chapter of the party will soon end. Kirim, who is the running mate to the APC governorship candidate, Senator Emmanuel Bwacha, disclosed this while addressing journalists shortly after his arrival in Jalingo from Abuja. His assurance comes after some aggrieved APC aspirants in the state have dragged Bwacha to court challenging his emergence as the governorship candidate. But Kirim assured that the party was still intact. “The little skirmishes you heard about are normal things. They are internal party issues that will be sorted out in the course of time. “We are one in the party, and we are working as a family to take over Taraba State comes 2023. “We are working on the psychology of our people so that they will not continue to operate on religious, tribal and regional sentiments at the detriment of our collective gains,” he said. He called on the citizens to support the party and the governorship candidate to move the state forward. This is even as he assured the people that a new Taraba would emerge after the party’s victory at the poll and urged them to obtain their PVCs to vote out the PDP in 2023.
