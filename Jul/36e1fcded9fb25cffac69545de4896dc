The Head of Civil Service of the Federation, Dr Folashade Yemi-Esan, has said 61,446 civil servants from various government Ministries, Departments and Agencies have been verified on the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System. She also said 3,657 civil servants have so far been reported to the Independent and Corrupt Practices and related offenses Commission for prosecution over failure to get verified on the platform.
