The Muslim Students’ Society of Nigeria in Osun State on Wednesday declared support for the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the Saturday’s election, Adegboyega Oyetola. The group, in a statement issued after its stakeholders meeting held in Osogbo, signed by Osun Unit’s Amir, AbduJelil Arikewuyo, noted that Oyetola’s performance, despite the meagre resources at his disposal was one of the factors considered before adopting him. Arikewuyo said, “Despite the meagre resources of the state, the state could not afford to start from scratch but to consolidate on the current feat. “We, therefore, appeal to the stakeholders to go back home and canvas their members, families, friends and well-wishers across the nooks and corners of the state to support Oyetola.”
