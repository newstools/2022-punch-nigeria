The Corps Marshal, Federal Road Safety Corps Dr. Boboye Oyeyemi, has directed Commanding Officers of the Corps across the nation to join hands with the Nigeria Police Force to enforce the ban on the spy number plate. The PUNCH reports that The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, has ordered a total ban on all use of Police SPY Vehicle Number Plates by vehicle owners across the states of the federation without exception. Oyeyemi, in a statement on Thursday by the Corps Public Education Officer, Bisi Kazeem, while commending the IGP on the ban asked the FRSC personnel to work with the police officers in enforcing the ban. The statement was titled, ‘Spy Number Plate Ban: Corps Marshal commends IGP, tasks commanding officers to complement Nigeria police to enforce compliance’. According to Oyeyemi, road users who also parade faded number plates should endeavour to replace them with new ones so as to avoid impounding their vehicles. Oyeyemi further ordered full force and immediate impoundment of private vehicles that are using commercial number plates He reiterated the implications of the continued use of faded and other unauthorized vehicle number plates to national security. “The use of the SPY and other unauthorized number plates to continually violate traffic rules and regulations must be brought to a halt, hence the directive given to Commanding Officers to brace up and ensure that they give adequate priority to the enforcement,” Oyeyemi was quoted as saying.
