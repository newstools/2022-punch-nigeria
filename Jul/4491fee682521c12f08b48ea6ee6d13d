Rasheed Olawale, spokesperson for the Osun State Governor-Elect, Senator Ademola Adeleke, on Tuesday, said his principal remained committed to his five-point agenda, top of which was workers’ welfare. This was contained in a statement signed by Olawale and obtained by The PUNCH in Osogbo, reacting to what he called “a sponsored fake news” purporting that Adeleke had reneged on his promise to clear backlog of salaries and pensions during a Channels TV interview. He said, “This is a lie from the pit of hell as Senator Adeleke throughout the interview never at any point disowned his promise to clear outstanding workers’ salaries, pension and gratuities and better the lives of all Osun people. “To the good people of Osun State, Senator Ademola Adeleke reiterated his commitment to his five-point agenda as well as his readiness to serve the people with full sincerity and openness. He is not only prepared for the task ahead but has an action plan to transform his five-point agenda into reality. “Contrary to the frustrated mind of the deceitful author, the governor- elect explained in detail how he will source fund to meet the needs of workers including his unique promise of reviewing issue of leakages in state finance and redirecting security votes to meet urgent state needs.” According to him, during the interview, Adeleke not only reiterated his pledge to address workers’ welfare, which was the first item on his five-point agenda, the Osun governor-elect also affirmed that payment of workers’ entitlement would not be recorded as an achievement by his administration. “On the larger governance issue, the governor-elect touched on his plans for education, security, job creation, agriculture, infrastructure, debt management and other germane issues. A people still in shock at their defeat probably could not concentrate on the full interview to watch a governor-elect displaying his clear grasp of issues and his preparedness to hit the ground running,” Olawale concluded.
