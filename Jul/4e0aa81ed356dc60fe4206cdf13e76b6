We call on the Federal Government and the NCDC to sit up,” Ojinmah said. Also, a medical virologist at Adeleke University, Ede, Dr. Oladipo Kolawole, said there was the need to “put great scientific-based preventive measures in place so that the wider population will not be affected. The priority is to stop transmission to others as soon as possible. “Anything international events or activities in affected regions or countries may likely be affected. Nigeria should be on alert as usual from previous experience because the country has the diagnostic capacity to curtail the virus through the lessons we have learnt from the previous outbreaks.” Reacting also, the immediate past President of the National Association of Resident Doctors, Dr. Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi, called on the Federal Government to create more awareness among the populace. “With monkeypox, COVID-19, cholera, and Lassa fever, people need to be more careful and this is the time the NCDC needs to be more on the alert. People should not neglect the non-pharmaceutical protocols, especially now that we are battling multiple disease outbreaks,” he said.
