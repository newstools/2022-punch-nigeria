The Delta State Government has recommended compensation for victims of the communal land tussle between Ozoro and Oleh communities in Isoko North and Isoko South Local Government Areas of the state, in which no fewer than seven people were killed about two years ago. This was contained in the White Paper on the resolution of the communal crisis, released by the State Government. Disclosing this on Tuesday while fielding questions from journalists shortly after inspecting ongoing projects at the Delta State University of Science and Technology, Ozoro, the State Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, disclosed that the White Paper contained approval to compensate families of the victims. Okowa affirmed that the State Executive Council had approved the White Paper on the crisis sequel to the recommendations of the Judicial Panel of Enquiry on the crisis. He said, “We have looked into the Ozoro-Oleh crisis and we are already implementing the decisions of the Judicial Panel. The Judicial Panel of Enquiry has finished its work and submitted its report. “The White Paper has also been released by the state’s Executive Council and the whole process to ensure peace is being implemented by the office of the Secretary to the State Government. “Unfortunately, we lost some people to the crisis. And, it is unfortunate we cannot bring them back. But I am also aware that approvals have been given to compensate the families who lost loved ones during the crisis. “The cheques will be released on Thursday this week, I just hope and pray that we do not go into that level of communal crisis anymore.” No fewer than seven indigenes of Oleh in Isoko South LGA of the state were purportedly killed in 2020 over land tussle at a boundary location with the neighbouring community of Ozoro in Isoko North LGA of the state.
