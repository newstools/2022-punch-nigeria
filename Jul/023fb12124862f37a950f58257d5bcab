The Senior Vice President, International Messaging, Globe Teleservices, Ashutosh Jha, was quoted as saying, “As one of the earliest users of RCS services from Dotgo, we were able to terminate critical and time bound messages with improved conversions, thanks to rich media’s ability to demand the user’s attention.” “CPaaS providers and telecom aggregators are always looking to identify new and innovative ways for their enterprise customers to connect and engage with end consumers via richer, personalized conversations. Innovations like Dotgo RBM Hub act as a catalyst to help us deliver on this goal, enabling a far superior customer engagement experience.” A recent study by Juniper Research predicts the total number of RCS subscribers to grow to 3.8 billion by 2026, which would account for 40 per cent of global mobile subscribers.

That has been made possible by the support from Dotgo. Dotgo’s RBM Hub allowed for a quick launch of our own MEF conversation agent across multiple countries and mobile operators in time for the MEF’s RCS World.”
