Emirates Airlines has urged intending summer holiday customers who are yet to make travel arrangements to do so at once in order to ensure that they are able to travel on their preferred dates and flights. This comes as daily booking volumes accelerate and travel rebounds from the impact of the pandemic. The summer holidays period, which happens to be about the busiest time for most airlines, sees Emirates preparing for its busiest period with over 550,000 customers expected to fly out from the UAE between June and July on over 2,400 weekly network-wide departures. The airline said in a statement that it had continued to add flights and frequencies where possible as it ramped up the summer schedule. Emirates noted that it would be operating close to 80 per cent of its pre-pandemic capacity, or over one million weekly seats for this summer to serve demand. The airline added that it had also introduced other technology-centric services, including self-check-in and bag drop kiosks at DXB, for a smoother and contactless airport experience. Emirates customers also now have the option to cut down their wait time with 25 mobile check-in ports, where they can get their boarding cards, weigh and tag their bags, and have any of their questions answered by check-in staff. However, from August 1, customers travelling from Dubai to London, Paris and Sydney will be able to experience the airline’s full Premium Economy experience, complete with dedicated check-in areas at DXB and luxurious seats offering unrivalled comfort, the airline further said. Customers returning from their holidays abroad can continue their summer experiences on the ground in Dubai with My Emirates Pass. Customers traveling between May 1  and September 30,  2022 can enjoy exclusive offers at over 500 locations, including restaurants, big-name retail outlets, spas and exclusive attractions across the city by simply showing their Emirates boarding pass, it noted.
