The new president of the Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria, Mr Edwin Igbiti, has said that his administration will ensure digital re-enforcement of the institute and insurance awareness creation. Igbiti said this during his investiture as the 51st president of the CIIN in Lagos on Friday. He said, “The choice of the theme was borne out of the need for continuity to sustain and build on the works of past presidents of the institute. This will guarantee that despite current global uncertainties, the institute will continue to meet the needs and aspirations of its members. “Against this backdrop, my presidency is going to unlock the potential of this approach by focusing on a three-point agenda as briefly outlined below: Digital reinforcement of the institute’s operations, insurance awareness for all – grassroots, youths and insuring public, and infrastructural development.” He said that efforts had been made by his predecessors to revamp the digital operations of the institute, but the institute needed to continuously upgrade and innovate its processes to deliver excellent customer experiences and members’ satisfaction. The new CIIN boss said he would facilitate the transformation of the CIIN secretariat with state-of-the-art facilities that would stimulate digital operations and processes while enhancing a work culture that would result in quality customer experiences in all its deliverables. Smart technologies and digital solutions would be deployed to achieve this together with a viable business model, he said.
