A businessman, Saheed Adediran, has joined rank of princes jostling to become the next Alaafin of Oyo. The contestant in a statement on Tuesday said his application had been submitted while promising that the peace and the development of Oyo town would be his priority if he is selected to succeed Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, who died in April 22. Adediran promised to use his influence and connections to assist the people. He said he and his family carefully examined his capability, interest, cultural value, intelligence, educational background and respect for Yoruba race at large and he was found to be qualified on all grounds before his application was endorsed. The statement read in part, “The main purpose of writing this letter is to express my interest in becoming the next king, the Alaafin of Oyo. “This intention is not sudden, it is what I considered necessary after my family and I have carefully examined my ability, capability, interest, cultural value, intelligence, educational background and respect for Yoruba race at large.”
