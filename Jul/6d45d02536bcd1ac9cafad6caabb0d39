Sagay, in the statement he personally signed, pointed out that corruption is affecting notable sectors in the world, adding that it poses an existential threat to the world.

The private sector and the public sector are debilitated by corruption. The sports world is affected by corruption. “Nations are experiencing unprecedented turmoil because of the ravages of corruption. Africa and Nigeria are no exception and are worse hit by corruption. “I salute the African Union for keeping hope alive regarding the need to have a stable and prosperous Africa via checkmating corruption. “I beseech all African leaders to lead from the front in fighting corruption for a better society on the continent.”
