The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), Friday in Abuja, has said that the All Progressives Congress’s long-term unity and cohesion remains the priority, while ambition comes second. According to a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, the President said this when he received a delegation of APC stakeholders led by the National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu at the State House, Abuja. The statement was titled ‘Nigeria’s unity beyond 2023, my priority, president Buhari tells APC stakeholders.’ Addressing the delegation of past and present governors and lawmakers, Buhari said, ‘‘I want to thank you all for the roles you played in the build-up, first to our national convention earlier this year, and later, to the primary elections. ‘‘You were all of one mind, wanting the best for the Party, with the candidate emerging in a free and fair manner. ‘‘For us all, the cohesion and unity of the Party was the first priority, and ambition was second. I am glad that you all saw the larger picture, rather than narrow, self-serving interests.’’ The President expressed confidence that Shettima would not disappoint the party, and Nigerians at large. A former governor of Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff, and senator representing Taraba South Senatorial District, Emmanuel Bwacha were also in attendance.
