The Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, issued this warning to the management of AG Vision after he inspected the ongoing work by the contractor in the company of the Minister of Transportation, Mu’azu Sambo. The SGF expressed displeasure at how the contractor was handling the road projects awarded since 2017.  with variation, He gave the contractor a one-week ultimatum to return to the site. Mustapha said, “I am very disappointed with the level of work here, normally it is the government that owes contractors and not the contractor owing the government. “This contract of Yola-Mubi road was awarded to AG Vision in 2017 for N22bn. Because of the slow pace of work, there was a review and this year another N29bn was approved. We do not want another review, the company must return to the site or face the consequences.” He added that the NNPC would inject funds into the project because of its strategic importance, linking Borno and Adamawa States. Speaking in the same vein, the Minister of Transportation, Sambo, stated to the contractor, “Your company is exhibiting incompetence.” However, the site engineer, Francis Musa, explained that work on the site stopped because of the Salah break and will resume next week. He said, “I want to also assure the Federal Government that the project will be completed as funds come in.”
