Determined to reduce housing deficit in the country, the Federal Housing Authority of Nigeria in partnership with Mixta Africa, has commenced action to provide more housing units for Nigerians. A statement quoted the Managing Director, FHA Mortgage Bank, Hayatudeen Awwal, as saying this during the inauguration of Expressview Estate in Abuja. He added that the partnership with Mixta Africa would ensure the effective delivery of the project in Lugbe. “Any development in Lugbe that is along the road is for the Federal Housing Authority. We delivered Gwarinpa, Karu, Maitama, Asokoro and Kubwa estates, and now we are here. The entire project will be funded to deliver houses with ease. We carefully selected the partners. We would have commissioned the project but the mask on the plot of land delayed the process,” Awwal said. Also speaking, the Country Manager, Mixta Africa, Sade Hughes, said the firm was carefully selected as a partner on the project because of their stellar records and commendable projects across Africa.
