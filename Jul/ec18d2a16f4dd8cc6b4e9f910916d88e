A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in Delta State, Air Vice Marshal Frank Ajobena (retd.), has quit the party in protest against the decision of the party’s presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, to settle for a Muslim-Muslim ticket. The retired Air Force chief, who is also a national caucus member of the APC described the Muslim-Muslim ticket as “the highest level of insensitivity to the Christian faith in the country.” This was contained in a statement issued by the APC chieftain, copies of which he made available to journalists in Warri on Monday. The PUNCH reported that Tinubu had picked former Governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima as his running mate for the 2023 presidential election. AVM Ajobena, who was the first Military Administrator of Abia State, noted further that it was inhumane for such a decision to be taken by Tinubu, whom he said, he respected so much The statement read partly, “Tinubu is not my enemy, I am not against him. But let’s call a spade a spade. It is not my character to be a double agent, I am not pretending; even though I like the APC, the right thing should be done. “The decision could be described as one that portrays arrogance and total disrespect to us, Christians, in the APC. “The latest development portrays us as a people who can easily be bought over with money. Such an action is a minus to our democratic system. In what capacity will I be serving in his campaign train? As a slave? “A man must stand for something, else will fall for anything, hence, I am quitting”.
