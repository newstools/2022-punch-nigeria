The Kano State government has shut down 26 illegal health training institutions in the state. This was contained in a statement by the Information officer, Kano State Ministry of Health, Hadiza Namadi and made available to newsmen on Friday. The statement said the affected institutions would remain closed pending the outcome of necessary investigations. It said some of those unrecognised institutions lacked definite sites and offered dubious programmes against the established course curricula, while also extorting exorbitant fees on students and their parents. The statement read: “The Kano State Ministry of Health has noticed with serious concern, the incessant proliferation of illegal Private Health Training Institutions (PHTIs) in the state without recourse to extant regulations governing the establishment and operation of such schools as specified by regulatory bodies and other relevant authorities.” “It is of serious dismay to realise that some of those unrecognised institutions lack definite sites and offer dubious programmes against the established course curricula, while also extorting exorbitant fees on students and their parents.” “Suffice to indicate, this ugly trend is at the detriment of the people, educational development and efficiency of the entire health system. “Consequently, the general public is hereby informed of the instant shutdown of all illegal Health Training Institutions (HTIs) in the state, pending the outcome of necessary investigations.” The statement advised residents to patronise only the duly registered institutions with accredited courses as any subscription to unrecognised schools was tantamount to self-subjection to security risks, doom academic and career prospects, as well as financial deceptions. “The Ministry will cooperate with all stakeholder agencies to ensure regular monitoring and inspection of the Health Training Institutions across the state for sanity and safety.”
