The Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, has explained why he directed his subjects and all residents of his town to vote for the incumbent Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, in the July 16 governorship poll. Speaking exclusively to Saturday PUNCH, Oba Akanbi said he gave the directive in the interest of his town, with the hope that if Oyetola got reelected, Iwo can work towards producing his successor in 2026. Oba Akanbi’s recent directive that the 90,000 registered voters in his domain should vote for Oyetola had raised opposing views in some quarters, with some people insisting that the royal father should be apolitical. But the monarch said it was part of his work to organise his people and ensure that their interests were well protected, stressing that whenever Osun West Senatorial District would produce a governor, it must be an indigene of Iwo. “If you want to define politics, it can mean the administration of a town. If that is correct, then traditional rulers are the real politicians. However, what a king is more concerned about is whatever is in the best interests of his people. That is beyond political party matters. “In Osun West Senatorial District, we are the only town being marginalised. If anyone from Osun West becomes the governor now, that means it won’t be the turn of Iwo in 2026. “I am in the position to tell my people that we should not lose the chance to produce a governor in the nearest future. My people should re-elect Oyetola so that we can have a chance at the governorship. “It is an ‘Iwo lokan project’. We started it a few years back, but we have yet to achieve it. But the dream is not dying. I am not looking at the interest of any party, but that of my people, and my people come first. It is Iwo first,” Oluwo added.
