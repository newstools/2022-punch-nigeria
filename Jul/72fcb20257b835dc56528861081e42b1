Food brand, Mamador says it has launched a new communication titled “Explore your Flavour,” as a wake-up call for women to experience life outside of daily routines. A statement by the company said the digital launch featured conversations leveraging notable personalities/influencers; veteran Nollywood Actor Ufuoma McDermott, Chef Ifeyinwa Mogekwu of Ify’s Kitchen and many others, who shared their exploration stories. It said the aim of the programme was to inspire and motivate women to explore their limitless sides and aim to achieve fulfillment in their chosen endeavours. The statement added that the brand equally released a television commercial with the intention of reaching every Nigerian woman and ushering her into an era of exploration and self-fulfillment. Speaking to the new communication and the commitment of the brand to inspiring Nigerian women, the Head of Marketing, PZ Wilmar, Chioma Mbanugo, stated that the idea behind the “Explore your Flavours” theme was born out of a need to inspire women to pursue those forgotten passions and dreams that might have been pushed aside due to circumstantial coercions and life pressures. “The average Nigerian woman is nurturing a potential talent or two which she refuses to explore due to circumstances or maybe societal pressure.” Mamador is out to give her that boost of confidence she needs to remember those talents and explore her flavours outside of her usual life routines.”
