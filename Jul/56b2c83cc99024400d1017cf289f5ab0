Nigeria’s former Vice President and current presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, is not the owner of Mikano International Limited, the management of the firm announced on Sunday. It disclosed this in a statement signed by its Managing Director, Firas Mamlouk, as it denied reports that the generator firm was owned or affiliated to the former vice president. Various social media posts had claimed that Abubakar was the owner of Mikano International Limited, a Nigeria-based company that was established in 1993 and deals with power generation, steel fabrication, electrical products, and solutions. Reacting to the claims on Sunday, the firm said, “The attention of the management of Mikano International Limited, promoters of Mikano Generators (among other products), has been drawn to numerous articles and press statements stating that the company is owned by/afflliated with Atiku Abubakar, GCON. “This disclaimer is a notice to the general public that the news does not represent the true facts as it concerns Mikano International Limited.” “Please be informed that Mikano International Limited is not owned, affiliated, associated, authorised, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Atiku Abubakar, GCON. Members of the public are therefore advised to disregard the news.” The PDP presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections has been in the news lately over wide-ranging issues, particularly as regards political matters. Saturday PUNCH reported that the Labour Party and the Tinubu Presidential Campaign Organisation had berated Abubakar on Friday for saying he would win the election next year.
