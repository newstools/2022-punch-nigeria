The Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa who also is the vice-presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party on Tuesday debunked reports that he had no West Africa School Certificate, saying he made second best result in his set in the country in 1976. Okowa spoke after inspecting ongoing projects at the Delta State University of Science and Technology, Ozoro in Isoko North Local Government Area. He said the issue around his certificate was a deliberate misconception and unnecessary politics, explaining that virtually all universities in the country offered him admission based on his outstanding performance in WASC and Higher School Certificate examination. The governor said, “On the issue of my certificate, I think it is a misconception. People try to play politics with everything. “Yes, I lost my WAEC certificate, but I have the print out from Edo College, Benin City, which clearly stated that I have distinction in all subjects. “The Higher School Certificate was attached and it has been acknowledged by Edo College and the school put it out there that I made an ‘A’ ‘B’ ‘B’. I do not pride myself but it was very difficult to make such a grade in high school at that time. “My high school result was the second best nationally in 1976, when I finished. So, many universities admitted me through Telegram as of that time, and I had to start making choices of which to accept. “Of course, it is very clear that I finished medical school at the University of Ibadan. I was 21years and some months. I was less than 22 years of age.’’
