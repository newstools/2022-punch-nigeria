A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress and former member of the House of Representatives, Elder Chidi Wihioka, has resigned from the party. This came barely 24 hours after a former acting Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission, Dame Ibim Semenitari, resigned from the party. Wihioka, an ally to Senator Magnus Abe, represented the Ikwerre/Emuoha Federal Constituency in the green chamber of the National Assembly. His resignation was contained in a letter addressed to the APC chairman in his ward (Elele Ward 3) in Rivers State. Wihioka, in the letter, said his decision for quiting the party was due to the high-handedness of one man who, according to him, believes he owns the party. The statement read in part, “I wish to oficially inform you of my resignation from the All Progressives Congress, APC. “My decision was taken based on the high-handedness of one man who thinks
and believes that he owns the party in Rivers State and his refusal to allow peace (to) reign in the party by giving everyone in the party equal level playing ground. “I will announce my next political party when I have found a suitable political one to join. “Nevertheless, my decision will not affect my support for the presidential
candidate of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, as I will always drum support for
him anywhere I find myself.” The recent gale of defections from prominent politicians, most of whom served in various capacities in the state and the national level under Rt. Hon. Rotimi Amaechi as governor, has raised concerns amongst politicians and several quarters. Other known politicians in the state who recently dumped the party are a former member of the House of Representatives, Dr. Dawari George, and a former member of the State House of Assembly, Golden Chioma.
