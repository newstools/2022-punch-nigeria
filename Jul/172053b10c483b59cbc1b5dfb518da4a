The presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, Omoyele Sowore, has said that his administration will probe past governments if elected into office in the 2023 presidential election. Sowore made this statement via his verified Twitter handle, @yeleSowore, on Saturday. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, had said that if elected into office in the 2023 elections, his administration would not carry out a witch-hunt of previous governments. Obi stated this in an interview with journalists shortly after unveiling an educationist, Dr. Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed, as his running mate on Friday. “As for probing the past government, let me tell you: you see me argue that you can’t close your shop and be chasing thieves, those who only look at yesterday and today will miss tomorrow. God did not give us eyes at the back, mine is to look forward. “If you come into the government today and decide to stop the leakage first, you will get more. I am not going to be part of any form of victimisation or witch-hunt, it won’t happen. Nigerians must live within law and order,” Obi said. Meanwhile, unlike Obi, Sowore said if the country could be retrieving money from late General Sanni Abacha, nothing should stop the country from retrieving from living government officials found culpable of looted funds. He said, “As President of Nigeria, I will probe and retrieve every penny stolen by past Nigerian rulers, those who have murdered innocents and deprived them of a bright future. If we could be retrieving money from dead and buried Sanni Abacha, we should retrieve from living legendary thieves.” Retweeting Sowore’s tweet, Sowore’s running mate, Haruna Magashi, posted, “There will be no exemptions, all political thieves, past and present will be stripped under our administration. Stolen funds from Nigerians must be taken back.”
