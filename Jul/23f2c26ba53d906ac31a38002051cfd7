The Lagos State Building Control Agency has evacuated occupants of distressed structures in Mushin and also marked eight others for demolition. A statement by LASBCA said the residents of the distressed structures had been served all statutory notices with verifiable evidence. The agency appealed to all occupants of all distressed structures marked for demolition in different parts of the state to vacate immediately from such buildings. It said the lives of the citizens of the state were of utmost value to the Lagos State Government. Last month, the General Manager of Lagos State Building Control Agency, Gbolahan Oki, had decried the alarming rate of defective structures in different parts of Lagos Island, noting that the agency would synchronise efforts with other agencies to rid the state of distressed structures. Oki had warned inhabitants of physically distressed structures to refrain from seeking additional time before vacating such dwellings as the structures could cave in at any moment. He said, “Our emphasis has always been that whenever you discover that a particular building is distressed, what is expected of you is to vacate such a building immediately without waiting for any prompting from government officials because a distressed building will not give warning before it collapses.” He said that although the demolition team of the agency was usually faced with the challenge of accessing some areas with the demolition caterpillar, the agency would continue to explore other available options to ensure that all marked distressed structures were safely brought down. Oki also disclosed that the agency had demolished over 20 distressed buildings in the last three months from different parts of the state, assuring that others already marked for demolition would also be pulled down.
