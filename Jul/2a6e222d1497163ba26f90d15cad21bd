The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Farouq disclosed this on Thursday in Asaba. Farouq, who was represented by the Delta Team leader, Margret Chuka-Ogwuche, said the National Social Investments Programmes Independent Monitors would be monitoring programmes at their community level in schools, households, and market clusters with a focus on ensuring that the primary objectives of the NSIPs are being achieved. She said, “The training and onboarding of Stream Two Independent Monitors was flagged off on 9th June 2022, in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory and we are here to carry out the same programme. “Today, we trained 30 in Delta and the Ministry provided working tools in the form of tablets for them to carry out their monitoring activities on the field. Monitors are one of the most important components of the NSIP and the Ministry lays special emphasis on ensuring its programmes are closely monitored. “The programme is very important and strategic as we train the additional men and women that will serve as stream two monitors. They will be given the prerequisite training and receive engagement letters and tablets as working tools for monitoring the programme. “They will monitor our programmes in Delta State which includes N-POWER, National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme, Conditional Cash Transfer Programme, and the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme. “For instance, the monitor can go to the school and ascertain how many pupils we are feeding, the quality of the food, evaluate them and send us the data.” She charged the appointees to listen attentively and use the resources and working tools to be provided judiciously.
