The Zamfara State chapter of the All Progressive Congress has recorded a major setback, following the defection of some major loyalists of a former governor of the state, Abdul Aziz Yari, to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party. The defectors, Salihu Maibuhu, Rabiu Ilili, and Abubakar Bargaja, announced their defection to the opposition PDP with their supporters. The defection has affected the reconciliatory process between Governor Bello Mattawale and his predecessor. Speaking to Saturday PUNCH on phone, Maibuhu said he and other defectors were not interested in the reconciliation between Matawalle and Yari. ‘’We are not interested in Matawalle-Yari reconciliation and we have decided to defect to the opposition PDP in the state. We are not with Governor Bello Mattawalle and that was why we left the APC together with our supporters. We will, however, continue with our relationship with the former governor, Abdul Aziz Yari. In his reaction, the spokesperson of the APC in Zamfara, Yusuf Idris, said, “The APC has never been moved by their decision to defect even as they failed to officially inform the party of their move which was without any reason but self-aggrandisement”.
