The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), Friday in Abuja, said next year’s elections would give the All Progressives Congress the opportunity to consolidate its  achievements of the past seven years. This was as he declared that his personal desire and priority of his regime is to bequeath an irreversible political process that continues to be both democratic and acceptable to Nigerians. According to a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, the President said this when he received a delegation from Nasarawa State led by its governor, Abdullahi Sule. The statement is titled ‘President Buhari: Elections in Anambra, Ekiti and Osun proof of my irreversible commitment to credible polls.’ The President noted that the off-season elections in Anambra, Ekiti and Osun States have confirmed his regime’s irreversible commitment to credible and violence-free polls in the country. He told the high-powered delegation that the Electoral Act, signed by him earlier this year, was an attestation of the fulfilment of the administration’s determination and commitment to the tenets of the rule of law. ‘‘On the issues of credible, free and fair elections in the country, I have always reassured my listeners both at home and abroad, my personal desire and indeed the priority of this administration is to bequeath to our nation an irreversible political process that continues to be both democratic and acceptable to the people. ‘‘My desire for our nation is that the 2023 elections should clearly mark the commencement of the institutional strength of our electoral body in conducting acceptable, credible and violence-free elections. ‘‘The forthcoming general election will provide us with the opportunity to convince the electorate of the need for continuity to enable our party to consolidate on our achievements in the last 7 years. ‘‘The Government and people of Nasarawa State, as usual, have a great role to play in returning our party to governance in the 2023 elections, in order to create a path for greater socio-economic growth and development. This is not only important for Nigeria alone, but also for the West African Sub-region,” he said. Describing Nasarawa as “very dear to his heart,” President Buhari said the state remains the symbol of hope and determination in collective efforts to entrench democracy in Nigeria. He said ‘‘To demonstrate this admiration and appreciation to the people of Nasarawa State, I personally attended the inauguration of Governor Tanko Al-Makura on May 29, 2011. “In 2015 and 2019, the state remained one of the strongholds of our great party, the APC. ‘‘I am optimistic that the people of the state, the APC Government and this broad representation of your delegation will not disappoint me, as we sustain concerted efforts in pushing forward the frontiers of good governance in our country.’ Buhari also stressed the need for partnerships among the three tiers of government to deliver good governance, infrastructure and critical services needed by the people. He pledged commitment to the joint efforts by the State and the Federal Governments to facilitate easy transportation by road, railways and airports as well as power as no nation can develop without these components of infrastructure. ‘‘The proximity of Nasarawa State to the FCT naturally makes the state a partner in infrastructural development. We, therefore, need more collaboration to enhance this proximity with other contiguous states to achieve more integrated development,’’ the President said, expressing appreciation to the government and people of the state for their continuing support to his administration. Governor Sule told the President that the delegation, comprising political office holders, royal fathers and community leaders, was in the Villa to show appreciation for the numerous projects executed by the Buhari-led regime, which Nasarawa State ‘‘is among the great beneficiaries.’’ He thanked the President for approving the Federal Government takeover of the Lafia airport, refunds for the completion of the Lafia-Keffi road, ongoing construction of Abuja-Keffi-Akwanga-Lafia-Makurdi dual carriage road, and appointment of prominent sons and daughters of the state into different positions in the Federal Government. On Lafia airport, Sule said: ‘‘By this approval we can now see our airport being properly utilised not only as a cargo, but also commercial and security airport. This will create enormous economic activities, employment opportunities and more importantly security for our State and region.’’
