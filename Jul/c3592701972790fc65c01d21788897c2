Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, played host to the former governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari, at his private residence in Rumuepirikom in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of the State on Tuesday. Governor Wike and his guest, Yari, together with his delegation later had a closed-door meeting. The reason for the visit or issues discussed were not made known to newsmen by any of the parties. After Yari left, the Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate of Katsina State, Senator Yakubu Lado and that of Kano State, Mohammad Abacha, also came visiting. Senator Lado told journalists after the closed-door meeting they had with Wike that they were on a courtesy visit to pay homage to their friend and brother. “We paid a courtesy call to our brother, the executive governor of Rivers State. Since the election is over, we have not been able  to visit Rivers State to come and pay homage to him. “That is why we are here to tell him that we are together as friends and brothers,” he stated. On their level of preparedness towards the 2023 governorship election in Katsina and Kano States and their chances of winning, Senator Lado  said they were very prepared and sure of delivering the party and winning the election. There has been a lull since three Governors of the All Progressives Congress including the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, and two other prominent politicians visited Wike at his residence over three weeks ago. The visits had higheten speculations that Governor Wike may dump the PDP, but he had yet to say anything in that regards.
