The Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra has slammed controversial Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, over what it described as a hypocritical assertion of pro-Biafra agitation. Gumi had stated, on Monday via his Facebook page, that pro-Biafra agitations had slowed down in the South-East because of Peter Obi’s emergence as a presidential candidate of the Labour Party in the 2023 general election. But MASSOB, in a statement on Tuesday, described Gumi’s claims as full of deceit and falsehood. In the statement signed by its Leader, Comrade Uchenna Madu, MASSOB said that so many pro-Biafra agitators have been in the self-determination struggle for Biafra actualisation and restoration. He said that Biafra agitators were not clamouring for the occupation of an Igbo man to be President of Nigeria. The statement partly read, “Our agenda is known, our mission is stated, our position is unshakable and uncompromised and our goal is to actualise an independent state of Biafra through the principles of non-violence. “We can never be cowed or intimidated by the chief patron and negotiator of the terrorist movement ravaging the entire northern region and rest of Nigeria. “MASSOB and other pro-Biafra organisations have nothing against Mr Peter Obi and his intentions to save Nigeria from further collapse. He believes in Nigeria, we believe in Biafra. If Nigerians elect him based on his competency and pedigree as their new president, does it concern MASSOB? It’s not our business. “Mr Peter Obi is not the first person to contest presidential election since September 1999, [when] we started the MASSOB non-violence self-determination struggle. Why attach him to us now? “MASSOB advised Shiekh Gumi to explain his role and other Fulani cabals in the terrorist attack and breaking of Kuje prisons in Abuja. Don’t use Mr Peter Obi and pro-Biafra agitation to divert attention.”
