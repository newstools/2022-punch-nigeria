Reacting, the Chairman, Progressive Shareholders Association of Nigeria, Boniface Okezie, said although it was important for banks to remunerate their directors properly, there was also the need to ensure this was not done recklessly. According to him, there is a need for the Central Bank of Nigeria to beam its searchlight on banks’ total payment to directors, warning that it will be wrong for the directors to feed fat at the expense of depositors and other stakeholders. Okezie said, “These are the issues the CBN needs to look at. The directors deserve to be well-remunerated but the CBN needs to put a peg on this. There is no point directors feeding fat while the interests of other stakeholders are not well protected.”
