Wild jubilation greeted the emergence of Ademola Adeleke as the governor-elect of Osun State. After the declaration of the result, crowd besieged Adeleke’s home in Ede, shouting, ‘imole’ (light), and ‘Ede l’okan’ (it’s Ede’s turn). Some of them were seen replicating Adeleke’s symbol of placing two fingers close to his eyes. The Independent National Electoral Commission on Sunday morning declared Adeleke the Governor-Elect of Osun State after scoring a majority of votes cast in the governorship election in the state. The victory came for Adeleke nearly four years after failing by a small margin in his bid to govern Osun State. On Saturday, Adeleke polled 403,371 votes to defeat his closest rival, the incumbent governor of the state, Gboyega Oyetola, who polled 375,027 votes. One of Adeleke’s supporters, Wasiu Sulaimon, expressed delight at the PDP’s candidate victory, saying, “We are happy because we have served APC for 12 years. Enough is enough. They should return to Lagos. It’s Ede’s turn.” Another jubilant supporter said, “They have failed us. We have shown them.” On his part, a supporter urged Adeleke to prioritise fixing od roads and electricity. “We thank God. May our joy not turn to sorrow. Imole is the one that can fix things. The governor should remember Ede, he should fix the road and electricity.” “2018, they cheated us, 2022 God gave us victory,” another supporter shouted.
