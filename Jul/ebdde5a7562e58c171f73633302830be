Angola’s former president Jose Eduardo Dos Santos died Friday at the age of 79 at a hospital in Barcelona after suffering cardiac arrest, the government said. With “great pain and consternation” the Luanda government posted on Facebook confirmation of Dos Santos’ death at 11:10 am (1010 GMT). “(The government) presents its deepest feelings of sorrow to the bereaved family,” the statement read, describing the former leader as a “statesman of great historical stature” who led the country through very difficult times. Dos Santos ruled the Portuguese-speaking, oil-rich state of Angola for 38 years before stepping down in September 2017. He was hospitalised in Spain and placed in intensive care after suffering a cardiac arrest on June 23.
