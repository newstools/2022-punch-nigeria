Kidnappers of one of the women leaders of First Baptist Church at Wetheral Road in Owerri, Imo State, Elizabeth Abioye, who was abducted during a church service, have released her. Her abductors left her off their hooks on Tuesday evening. The church in a message of appreciation on Tuesday night confirmed her release and thanked God and those who played important role in her safe return. The appreciation message read, “People of God, let us make a joyful noise unto the lord, our sister, Mrs  Abioye has been released by her abductors. Praise God. “We give thanks to the Lord, our God for the marvelous way He heard and answered our prayers over her release. “She was released today, July 19, 2022, from her kidnappers and she is back home safe and in sound mind. “Our gratitude to everyone that prayed, gave, called and supported us in diverse ways since July 10.” The victim who is the wife of the General Manager of Imo Zoological Garden at Nekede, Francis Abioye, was kidnaped on July 10 at the church. Her kidnappers had shot repeatedly into the air before taking her away. It could not be immediately ascertained if any ransom was paid, but a church source confided in our correspondent said her abductors demanded N100m as the condition for her release. While her husband had made an offer of N5m which was turned down, church members were allegedly asked to donate into a designated account so as to secure the release of the women leader, the source said. The police spokesperson, Micheal Abattam, had yet to issue a statement on the release of the woman as of the time of filing this report.
