The All Progressives Congress in Cross River State has begun mobilisation for grassroots support among residents for the collection of  Permanent Voter Cards in 3,281 polling units in the state. The state Chairman of the party, Alphonsus Eba, who made this known in Calabar said, “The second phase of our political evangelism will take place in the entire 3,281 polling units of Cross River State. We have brought on the polling unit structure, the women wing, the youth wing, and the people living with disabilities. “This is to consolidate our grassroots presence in our various polling units and the charge, therefore, is that we must move from door to door not only winning souls into our party but also carrying out enlightenment campaign to enable Cross Riverians, not only members of our party, Cross Riverians, even those who are apolitical to get their PVCs.” Eba said the party was “going into the field to preach peace, love” and unity so that the party and state would grow. He also alleged that the opposition was destroying the APC candidates’ billboards and charged party members to exercise restraint and not to take the laws into their hands. He noted that the deputy governorship candidate of the party would be unveiled before 15 July, while efforts were ongoing to reconcile aggrieved members of the party, including the governorship aspirant, Senator Owan Enoh.
