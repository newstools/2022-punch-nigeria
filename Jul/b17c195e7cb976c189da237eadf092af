The Redeemed Christian Church of God has issued a disclaimer debunking a purported meeting between its General Overseer, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, and the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu. Several news platforms (not The PUNCH) had reported that the revered cleric met with Tinubu on Sunday at the Redemption Camp in Ogun State. Debunking the claim, the church’s Public Relations Office, in a statement on Tuesday, noted that such a meeting did not hold. The statement read, “It has come to our notice that some news outlets are reporting that a meeting Between Pastor E.A. Adeboye, The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God Worldwide, and the former Governor of Lagos State, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, was held a few days back at the Redemption Camp where our esteemed father in the Lord was said to have supported the preferred candidature of the party the former governor is a member of. “This is to inform the general public that Pastor E.A. Adeboye is under the authority of God, the Christian Association of Nigeria, and the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, and as such, will not speak on behalf of Christians on issues regarding policies.” “Pastor E.A.Adeboye and the RCCG have not and will not endorse any candidate for the 2023 General elections in Nigeria.” Noting that the news of the meeting was false, the church warned, “News outlets should desist from spreading false information about Pastor E.A. Adeboye and the RCCG as it defeats the code and ethics of journalism and the full weight of the law will be employed if such happens in future.” On its official Instagram page, the church added, “The General Overseer of The Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor E. A. Adeboye, did not hold any closed-door meeting with Mr. Bola Tinubu for support of any sort.” See the statement below:
