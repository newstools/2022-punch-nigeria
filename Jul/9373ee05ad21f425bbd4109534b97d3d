The Association of Waste Managers of Nigeria says it has inaugurated the Oyo State chapter in its bid to serve the Nigerian public with zest and efficiency. A statement by the association said its President, Dr David Oluwasegun Oriyomi, at the ceremony in Ibadan recently, said it was important that they worked in the best interest of their members and the environment, The president also said that as an essential service provider, “we focus on servicing our clients. “It is the quality of service we provide that will prompt our clients to pay. We must aggressively deliver our services in the same aggression with which we drive the collection of our revenues.” Stating that the industry was capital-intensive and highly sensitive to foreign exchange rates, the president noted that members were using naira to fund dollar-related costs, making it not a business for the faint-hearted. He pledged the national body’s support for the chapter, promising to avail them guidance, business support, local and international training, access to funding,  national and international visibility  through a recognised strong brand and strong affiliation with international reputable organisations such as ISWA
