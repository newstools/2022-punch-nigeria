The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Abdullahi Adamu, has given reasons why the party lost the Osun State governorship election on July 16. Adamu said the crisis within the APC led to the loss, and not that the party was not capable of winning. He disclosed this in an interview with BBC Hausa on Tuesday. The PUNCH reports that the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Ademola Adeleke won the election after polling a total of 403,371 votes beating the incumbent, Adegboyega Oyetola of the APC who got 375,027 votes in a keenly contested race. Giving the reason, Adamu said, “We lost the race not because we are incapable but because of the crisis within. We had a massive gathering of supporters a few days before the election in Osogbo. No one could ever anticipate that we would lose the election. He noted that it was a tradition of life to lose something that was really needed by someone, noting that the party agreed to the defeat in good faith and learnt from it. He was very hopeful that the party would however win in the forthcoming 2023 elections. Adamu added, “Osun defeat doesn’t in any way mean that we will lose at the general election. We only lost one state out of the 22 we have; you see, we are still strong. “We will sit and check ourselves. We must ask ourselves what is right and wrong and what needs to be corrected.”
