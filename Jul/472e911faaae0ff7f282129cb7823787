A South-West political stalwart on the platform of the New Nigeria People’s Party, Olufemi Ajadi, has sent goodwill messages to the Muslims, saying Eid is about sharing with those in need. In his remarks, while addressing journalists at Ibafo, Ogun State yesterday, Ajadi said that Eid-Al-Adah is a sign of redemption as Allah replaced Ismael with a ram while Prophet Ibrahim wanted to use him as a sacrifice. “Your prayers and sacrifice will never go unanswered. On this Eid-Al-Adha. So, embrace Allah’s divine blessings with all that you have. “May the choicest blessing of Allah fill your life with joy substance and may the bluebird of happiness cover you,” he said. He added that Nigerians should know that it was only through unity and the love-of-one-another that they could survive the present situational test from Allah. He said, “Prophet Ibrahim was only tested for Allah to know how strong he was and Ibrahim passed the test. We as Nigerians have been tested and we can only pass the test through patience.”
