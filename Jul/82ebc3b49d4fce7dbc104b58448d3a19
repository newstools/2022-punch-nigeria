Following the terrorist attacks on the Kuje Correctional facility on July 5 as well as others recorded nationwide, the Federal Government is considering a ban on the use of motorcycles and mining activities. The Ministers of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, Justice, Abubakar Malami and Police Affairs, Maigari Dingyadi, disclosed this to State House Correspondents shortly after Thursday’s Security Council meeting chaired by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). The cabinet members were, however, silent on whether the ban would be nationwide or restricted to the affected regions of the country. According to them, the Council is considering both measures to cut off funding and logistics which the terrorists have leveraged to execute their nefarious activities. Malami revealed that the use of motorcycles allowed the terrorists to move around funds sourced from mining and channeled to purchase arms. The federal government, he said, ws now considering ways to block the sources already identified. The Minister of Justice also noted that the terrorists have since evolved their financing techniques to mining and ransom-taking, necessitating the government’s intervention. On his part, the Minister of Interior, Aregbesola, said despite the extensive intelligence gathered before the attack on the Kuje Correctional Center, the terrorists succeeded because “there was no will to act.” He revealed that President Buhari has received a report on the preliminary investigation on the Kuje attack and officers who have been found to renege on their responsibilities would be punished.
