The Ghana Immigration Service has directed its personnel to put in place strict measures that would prevent fleeing inmates from entering the country. Terrorists had attacked the Kuje Medium Custodial Centre on Tuesday, July 5, and freed 879 inmates including those linked with terrorism. 443 had so far been recaptured. On Friday, the Nigerian Correctional Service released the names and images of 69 fleeing inmates with terrorism cases. But in a leaked memo dated July 8 and signed on behalf of the Comptroller-General by Laud Affrifah, the Ghana Immigration Service stated that it was likely the escapees would attempt to enter Ghana through both approved and unapproved routes. The service, however, ordered its personnel to intensify patrols to stop and intercept all escapees at the country’s borders. It partly read, “It is believed that the Jihadist group Boko Haram are behind the attack which saw the use of high-end explosives and guns, that freed all 64 Boko Haram linked inmates at the prison and are among the escapees who are still on the run. “Considering current migration trends of Nigerians within the sub-region, it is likely most of the escapees will attempt to enter Ghana through both approved and unapproved routes. “In view of the above, I am directed to inform you to institute stringent measures at all Points of Entry and intensify patrols to deter and intercept all escapees who will attempt to infiltrate the country. “Find attached pictures with names of the escaped Boko Haram suspects.
Please treat as urgent.”
