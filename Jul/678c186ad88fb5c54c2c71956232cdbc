The All Progressives Congress in the North West zone, on Thursday, expressed concern  over the massive Permanent Voters Cards lying uncollected in the offices of Independent National Electoral Commission in the zone. Against this backdrop, the youth wing of APC in the zone, has embarked on sensitisation and  mobilisation of the youths for onward collection of the PVC without further delay. The party’s youth leader in the zone, Abdulhamid Mohammed, while briefing newsmen shortly after youth zonal meeting in Kaduna, said the zone could not afford to lose votes of the youths because they constituted 25 per cent of the voting population in the North-West. He said, “Our commitment as the APC North-West youth wing is to mobilise the youths in the zone to commit themselves to voting during the 2023 general elections. “We are calling on the youths to go and collect their PVCs because a lot of PVCs, from INEC statistics belong to the youths. We know the number of them that have collected and those that have not collected. “We have thought it wise to create awareness to ensure that the youths collect the PVCs because of the importance of youths in the forthcoming elections. “Everybody knows the importance of the youths in an election because they form 75 percent of the voting population across the country and 25 percent in the North west. “Before now youths in the country were used for thuggery, but we are grateful to the APC government for making sure that youths are engaged in political activities without being used as thugs. “We appreciate the APC leaders in the zone for the political importance attached to youth. Each and everyone knows the vital roles youths played during the last general elections which gave victory to APC throughout the country. “Therefore, we will continue to mobilise the youths in the zone towards committing themselves to ensure that APC wins the elections again in 2023.”
