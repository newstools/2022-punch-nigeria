The Peoples Democratic Party in Osun State has said the absence of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the re-election rally of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola held in Osogbo on Tuesday was a sign of his disapproval of any attempt to rig the Saturday governorship election. A statement signed by the PDP caretaker chairman, Akindele Adekunle, obtained in Osogbo, then called on the security agencies to take a cue from that and reject unlawful directive to rig Saturday’s poll. The statement read in part, “Buhari’s absence at the rally was a signal of his disapproval of any attempt to rig the governorship election as directed by the APC National Chairman, Adamu Abdullahi. We call on law enforcement agencies to resist unlawful orders and protect the democratic process. “President Buhari now eyeing his own legacy clearly snubbed the Osogbo rally. It is now left to security chiefs to know that aiding and abetting rigging are not only criminal but also carry heavy repercussions afterwards.” “We particularly condemn Governor Oyetola for his assertion that he would not hand over power even before the election was held. We find the statement as anti-democracy and a declaration of war against the democratic process.” Efforts to get reaction from the media adviser to the Osun APC chairman, Kola Olabisi, were futile as calls to his mobile line did not go through and he had yet to reply to messages sent to him as of the time of filing this report.
