A Plateau State High Court, on Thursday, reserved judgment in a case filed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission against a ex-Plateau State Governor, Jonah Jang, and a former cashier with the state government, Yusuf Pam, over an alleged N6.3bn fraud. Justice Christy Dabup reserved judgment on the four-year-old case, saying the judgment date will be communicated to the parties involved in the suit. The court arrived at the decision after both the prosecution and the defence counsel adopted their written addresses. At the resumed hearing of the case in Jos on Thursday, lead counsel for the EFCC, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN), brought two applications asking the court to grant him leave to appeal an earlier ruling by the court against the anti-graft agency during the trial within trial. However, counsel for the second defendant, Sunday Odey, opposed the applications and urged the court to go ahead with the business of the day since the applications had no bearing with the adoption of their final addresses. After a heated argument between both parties, Jacob conceded to the defence counsel that the business of the day, which was the adoption of written addresses, should go on as planned. In his address, Jang’s lead counsel, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), urged the court to dismiss all the charges against his client and set him free because the prosecution had not proven their case beyond any reasonable doubt. In response, the prosecution counsel urged the court to uphold his case. Counsel for the second defendant, in his address, also urged the court to dismiss prosecution’s case and insisted that his client did nothing wrong to warrant his prosecution. Justice Dabup, thereafter adjourned the case saying “the ruling for this case will be at a date to be communicated later.”
