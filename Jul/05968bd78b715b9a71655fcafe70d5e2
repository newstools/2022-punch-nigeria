Former Kano State Governor, Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, Monday, expressed satisfaction with the choice of Bola Tinubu’s running mate in the 2023 presidential race. The presidential flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, nominated the ex-Borno governor, Kashim Shettima, as his running mate. The 55-year-old banker-turned-politician, who is the senator representing Borno Central District, was described by Kwankwaso as a good man during an interview with Arise News monitored on Sunday by our correspondent. “Shettima was my colleague as a governor during my second term. He’s a gentleman, he’s a good man. I wish him well. “I’m so happy with that combination; my only worry is the platform ( the APC). This platform…I don’t know. “Bola Tinubu is a strategist. I had reasons to sit with him an uncountable number of times from 1992 till date. “I wish I will see him to ask what he’ll do differently from what the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari is doing today. That is my serious concern for him”, he said. Kwankwaso, 65, who is the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, was also a former Defence Minister and former Senator, representing Kano Central Senatorial District from June 2015 to June 2019.
