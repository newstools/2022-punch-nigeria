The governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party in Delta State, Chief Kenneth Gbagi, has picked a woman as his running mate. The nominee, Chief Mrs. Oshilim Rosemary, according to a statement from the party, hails from Ukwuani Local Government Area, one of the sub-groups that make up the Igbo West Anioma group in the state. Party sources explained that by the selection of a female as the running mate, Chief Gbagi had broken records in the state as none of the governors, since the creation of the state, had appointed a woman as running mate.
A party faithful, who sought anonymity, told our correspondent that the selection of a woman as the running mate had made Chief Gbagi one of the most strategic thinkers among the governorship candidates from the four major parties that would be contesting the election in the state. He noted that with the nomination, Delta women would vote massively for a woman in the forthcoming governorship election in the state as they would see her presence in the government house as a boost for women’s recognition in the proposed government to be formed by the SDP. Meanwhile, Chief Gbagi has stated that the ruling Peoples Democratic Party in the state “is presently hospitalised, receiving first aid in the hands of non-specialists who are complicating and opening more cracks in the umbrella that is yet to be amended.” Chief Gbagi, while urging the people of the state to fully support his governorship aspiration for a better state, said that “with the SDP, the light has come to the State.” He also assured people that “with the envisaged SDP victory in the state in the 2023 general election, victory awaits the entire Deltans.”
