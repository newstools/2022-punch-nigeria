The Ogun State Government and the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry have entered into partnership to establish a paper mill production company. The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, visited the state’s Commissioner for Industry, Trade and Investment, Kikelomo Longe, on the collaboration. During a visit to the commissioner, the Chairperson, Printing and Publishing Group, LCCI, Layo Okeowo, said the collaboration would boost the economy of Lagos and Ogun states. Layo added that the partnership would also bring investors into the host state, stressing that the paper mill was a multimillion investment. Okeowo said that LCCI had indicated an interest in investing in the paper mill value chain in the state. She sought the allocation of 20 hectares of land by the government as its equity contribution toward the establishment of a modern and functional paper mill in the state. According to her, the demand for paper and related products in Nigeria has grown to more than three million metric tonnes annually. She added that the installed production capacity had stagnated at 200,000 metric tonnes, thus making importation of raw materials and finished products inevitable. “According to investment analysts, 4.3 million worth of investment machinery can produce 100 metric tonnes of paper per day,” she said.
