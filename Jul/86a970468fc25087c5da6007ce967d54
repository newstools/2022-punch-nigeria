The national leadership of the Inter Party Advisory Council, on Wednesday, pleaded with political parties fielding candidates in the Saturday’s Osun governorship poll not to resort to use of hoodlums to cause violence or inducement of security men during the poll. This was contained in a statement by the IPAC national chairman, Yabagi Sani, obtained in Osogbo. He then urged political parties and their candidates to willingly commit themselves to avoiding actions that could trigger violence or compromise the credibility of the poll. The statement read in part, “The political party leaders and candidates in the election must resist the temptation, out of desperation, to resort to the deployment of thugs or material and financial inducement of security agents and INEC officials to compromise any stage in the voting process. “We are also very stridently appealing to the security agencies and their operatives engaged to provide security during the election to embark on their assignment with maximum professional and ethical standards. “Electorate must resist all attempts to be deceived, intimidated or induced into compromising their fundamental, inalienable right to freely elect the political leaders of their choice.”
