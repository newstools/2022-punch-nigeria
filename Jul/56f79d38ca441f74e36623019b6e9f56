THE Akin Fadeyi Foundation, a non-governmental organisation supported by the MacArthur Foundation, has reignited the hopes of young women in pursuing leadership positions in Nigeria’s political scene. The foundation, which has been vocal in tackling corruption and eradicating social injustice, during an event on Tuesday, hosted media personalities to discuss the topic, “Gender Inclusive Governance.” The Foundation’s founder, Akin Fadeyi, said the purpose of the discourse was to drive the change needed for women to become actively involved in Nigerian politics. In his remarks, the foundation’s Board Chairman, Simon Kolawole, said the Nigerian political space was yet to implement gender balance. Kolawole said, “This conversation is very important. We need to increase the volume of this debate so that those in a position to act will effect changes. “It is sad that other countries are discussing gender equity and parity, while Nigeria is still on gender inclusion, especially in the political scene.” Several journalists and media personalities participated in the parley as part of the initiative to drive women’s inclusion in governance. While speaking, the Coordinator of the African Centre for Media and Information Literacy, Dr. Chido Onumah, said, “We need to have clear-cut roles for women in politics when we talk about restructuring or political reforms in Nigeria.” Also, the Ondo State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Bamidele Ademola-Olateju, said, “In politics and governance, structures are formed against women. To challenge this, women must form a structure to push their agenda. Women who are already in leadership positions must further push for gender-responsive governance. “Women should fight for their place,” she added.
