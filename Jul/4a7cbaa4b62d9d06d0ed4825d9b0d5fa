A public primary school teacher in Ogun State, Mrs. Ibijoke Abiola, has donated and equipped the library at her school of primary assignment, Ansarudeen Primary School 2, Kemta, Ilawe, Abeokuta, to promote and encourage reading habits among the pupils of the school. Speaking in Abeokuta during the donation and the launching of a book titled, “Muse of My Childhood,” Mrs. Abiola said the purity of growing up has always been garnished by fun and the role nature plays in amusing us, saying the book would be of immense benefit to teachers, learners, and researchers in promoting indigenous culture, literacy and appreciate the nature. Abiola explained that her written prowess was derived during the OgunDIgiClass project, adding that the piece of the work reflects the joy children derives from playing with natural elements and their perceived relationship with them. “I am not just handing over dozens of books, but dozens of dreams, dreams that learners can pursue; dreams that can make them more successful, open-minded, stronger, and better people,” she noted. In her address, the special Adviser to the Ogun State governor on Primary and Secondary Education, who also was the Special Guest of Honour at the event, Mrs. Ronke Soyombo, solicited the support of well-meaning Nigerians to continue to support the state government by contributing their quota towards development of the education sector in the state. Appreciating the donor on behalf of other learners in the school, Akintoye Taiwo, a primary 4 pupil, said the generosity would further enhance their learning abilities and help them in pursuit of academic excellence.
