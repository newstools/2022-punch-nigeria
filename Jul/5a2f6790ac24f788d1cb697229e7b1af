A Federal High Court sitting in Osogbo, the Osun State capital, has ordered the Osun Security Network, codenamed Amotekun Corps to sit out Saturday’s governorship election in the state. The court order also mandated the Independent National Electoral Commission not to make use of the Amotekun Corps as part of security details for the election. The court presided over by Justice Ayo Emmanuel while ruling on the suit filed by the Peoples Democratic Party by its lawyer, Hashim Abioye, ordered Amotekun not to serve as either security personnel or volunteer in the guber election. Part of the order reads, “That the 1st defendant (INEC) is hereby restrained from requesting the deployment of the second defendant (AMOTEKUN) as part of the security personnel deployable for the purpose of Osun 2022 governorship election pending the determination of the originating summons filed in the suit. “That the second defendant is hereby restrained from deploying or volunteering her officers, agents, staff ad part of the security personnel deployable for the purpose of Osun 2022 governorship election pending the determination of originating summons filed in the suit. “That the applicant should file an undertaking indemnifying the respondent should this application not be granted in the first place.” The PDP had in its suit before the court sought an “order of interlocutory injunction restraining the 1st defendant from requesting the deployment of the 2nd defendant as part of security deployable for the purpose of Osun 2022 governorship election pending the determination on the originating summons filed in the suit “An order of interlocutory injunction restraining the 2nd defendant from deploying or volunteering her officers, agents, staff, as part of the security personnel deployable for the purpose of Osun 2022 governorship election pending the determination of the originating summons filed in the suit.” The judge, however, adjourned the case to July 20, 2022.
