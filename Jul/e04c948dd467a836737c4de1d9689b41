The governorship candidate of the Boot Party in the July 16 Osun governorship poll, Prince Adesoji Masilo, has said refusal of the incumbent governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, to take care of other political parties in the state, made him to join the governorship race to remove him. Masilo also said if elected, he would assemble prominent indigenes in the state known for being truthful into his cabinet. Speaking with Saturday PUNCH with our correspondent, Masilo said with his popularity in Osun, he would defeat the incumbent governor and others in the race. He said that his major task would be to give approval to actions taken by the eminent personalities that would form the state cabinet. He said, “If elected governor, education committee would be chaired by Professor Olu Aina, heath committee, would be chaired by Professor Isaac Adewole, the former minister of Health, security committee would be led by Lt. Gen. Alani Akinrinade (retd.), and supported by ex-IGP Tafa Balogun. “Then there would be another big committee called ‘Eagle Eye’ that would be chaired by Pa Bisi Akande, ex Osun state governor. Bringing them together would take shine off me and I don’t mind.”
