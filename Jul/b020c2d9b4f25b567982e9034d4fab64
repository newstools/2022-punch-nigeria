The All Progressives Congress governorship candidate in Kaduna State, Senator Uba Sani, has said that the state will give the highest votes to its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, in the 2023 presidential election. Sani, who’s the incumbent lawmaker representing Kaduna Central Senatorial Zone, also debunked rumour making the rounds that there is a rift between the APC’s vice-presidential candidate, Senator Kasim Shettima, and the state Governor, Nasir El-Rufai. The lawmaker, in a statement on Friday, said El-Rufai whom he described as “our leader” will deliver Kaduna for the Tinubu/Shettima ticket in the 2023 presidential elections because “Elrufai reigns supreme” in the state. According to the statement, Sani gave the assurance at the official inauguration of Shettima as the Chairman, Arewa Women for Tinubu, organized by the support group. The governorship candidate while dismissing the rumoured rift between Shettima and El-Rufai as “malicious and borne out of ignorance” of the brotherly relationship between the duo, pledged that the party’s presidential candidate would garner most of its winning votes from the state. “I want to also deliver a goodwill message from my brother, Governor Nasir Ahmed El-Rufai of Kaduna State. “I want to also say here that Governor El-Rufai has total support for our brother, His Excellency, Senator Kashim Shettima; we have worked together, we are brothers and we are friends,” he said. He noted that when the news broke out that Shettima had been selected as Tinubu’s running mate, El-Rufai was the first to try to call and wish him well. Unfortunately, he said, a lot of people, obviously ignorant of the cordiality between El-Rufai and Shettima spread false reports in the media. “I assure you, and stand to be quoted anywhere, anytime that Kaduna State would deliver the highest votes for the Tinubu presidency in 2023,” the lawmaker added.
