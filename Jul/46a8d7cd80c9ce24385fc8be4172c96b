Youths of Amiri, Mgbidi, Otulu and Awo Omamma communities in the Oru East and Oru West Local Government Areas of Imo State, on Tuesday, blocked the Owerri-Onitsha Road in protest against the alleged killing of seven of their kinsmen by the Ebubeagu Security outfit. The victims were retuning from a wedding ceremony at Awo Omamma when the Ebubeagu Security officers allegedly opened fire on them. Many of the youths, who spoke to our correspondent during the protest, asked the state governor, Hope Uzodimma, to bring the killers of their kinsmen to justice. One of them, Kingsley Madu said, “We are calling on the state governor to prevail on security operatives to order an investigation into the killing of our youths and making sure that the suspects are arrested and brought to justice.” Another youth, who simply identified himself as Ikenna, said “Our communities are in turmoil. We are crying and we are demanding for justice. We are saying that enough is enough. We can’t be in our land and be killed every day.” The youths were addressed by soldiers who offered them protection during the protest. The spokesman for the Police in the state, Micheal Abattam, said that the command was investigating the crime.
