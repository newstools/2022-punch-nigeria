Some members of the All Progressives Congress in Ede, Osun state, on Thursday accused members of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party of attacking the secretariat of the party in the town, during which four APC members were injured. A member of APC, identified as Usman Abdullateef, who claimed to have witnessed the incident, told newsmen that some PDP members coming for Oke Gada and going towards the venue of PDP rally held in front of Oba Laoye Grammar School, suddenly stormed APC secretariat for Ede South located in Oke Egan and attacked those found on the premises. Beside four people that were injured, Abdullateef said motorcycles parked in the compound were destroyed while the building was also vandalised. He said, “The PDP is holding a governorship rally in Ede today. Their members trekked from Oke Gada area to the venue of their campaign opposite Oba Laoye Grammar school, Ede. “The APC party secretariat of Ede South is situated along the road near St. Peters Primary School, Ede. While they were passing, some of their members attacked our secretariat. They injured four members of our party and destroyed property in the secretariat including bikes, vehicles among others.” Another member of APC, Teju Olasupo while speaking to our correspondent, said those that were injured were treated in an undisclosed hospital in Ede. But when contacted, spokesperson Senator Ademola Adeleke Campaign Organisation, Rasheed Olawale, dismissed the allegations. He said, “It is a lie. They attacked our members out of envy that Timi of Ede, Oba Munirudeen Lawal, has instructed Ede Indigenes to vote en masse for Senator Ademola Adeleke. “That instruction angered them and they unleashed violence on our members. They were actually the ones that attacked us.”
