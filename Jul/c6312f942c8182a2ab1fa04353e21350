A former acting Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission, Dame Ibim Semenitari, has resigned as a member of the All Progressive Congress. Semenitari had served as Rivers State Commissioner for Information and Communications under Rt. Hon. Rotimi Amaechi as Governor. The journalist and Cable News Network award winner was a frontline member of the campaign train of Vice President Yemi Osibanjo who contested the presidential primary of the APC ahead of the 2023 election. The former NDDC boss resignation from the APC was contained in a letter addressed to her Ward chairman in Ward 5, Okrika local Government Area of the state dated June, 9, 2022. While appreciating the party for the solidarity and opportunity it provided to serve in various capacities both in the state and the country at large, she wished the ruling party well. The letter which was obtained by our correspondent reads, “I write to resign my membership of the APC with effect from today. “I appreciate the friendship, camaraderie and opportunity that this platform has provided me to serve my state, region and country, even as I wish the party well. “Please be assured of my regards always.” When contacted, Dame Semenitari confirmed her resignation to our correspondent in a terse response on Sunday. The latest resignation came barely two days after a former member of the House of Representatives, Dr. Dawari George, took the same decision. Before George, who was a former Commissioner for Energy and Natural Resources in the state tendered his resignation from the party, Hon. Golden Chioma, an ally to Senator Magnus Abe also resigned from the main opposition party in the state. None of the aforementioned political heavyweights in the state had disclosed their next political destination.
