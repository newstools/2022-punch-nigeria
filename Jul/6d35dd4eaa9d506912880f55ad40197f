The Independent National Electoral Commission said it had processed 476 requests of Certified True Copies of documents to aid litigation by aggrieved individuals in court. The decision followed the recent party primaries conducted for nomination of candidates for the 2023 general elections. The commission’s National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said this in a statement issued on Wednesday in Abuja. It partly read, “The commission has continuously responded to requests for the issuance of CTCs of documents mainly arising from the conduct of party congresses, primaries and nomination of candidates. The number of requests processed has now risen to 1,662,987 pages of documents. “Sadly, in spite of the commission’s effort, 147 out of 476 requests processed as at today involving 5,646 pages are yet to be collected by applicants. “The commission appeals to prospective litigants to come forward and collect the certified copies of the documents.” Okoye added that the July 15 deadline set for the submission of the list of governorship and House of Assembly candidates by political parties remained sacrosanct. According to him, the commission had processed 6,995 nomination forms (EC9) uploaded by 16 out of 18 political parties for the constituencies where they intend to sponsor candidates. He however regretted that two political parties, the African Action Congress and New Nigeria Peoples Party were yet to upload a single nomination to the portal. “The commission hereby reminds all political parties that they have three days left to upload their list of candidates to the ICNP. “The deadline is Friday July 15, 2022. The portal will automatically shut down at 6.00pm on that date,” Okoye reiterated.
