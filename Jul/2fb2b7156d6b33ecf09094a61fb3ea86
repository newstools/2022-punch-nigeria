The Christian Association of Nigeria, for the umpteenth time, dissociated itself from the unveiling of the vice-presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Kashim Shettima. According to CAN, those who were presented as church leaders and Bishops were “unknown clerics.” CAN made the clarification in a statement by its General Secretary, Joseph Daramola, in Abuja on Thursday, titled, “Stop impersonating us, CAN tells politicians.” He said, “We are shocked, disappointed and worried about the desperation of some politicians who once claimed Christians do not matter in governance and politics but went to hire some unknown ‘bishops, pastors and priests’ to impersonate the leadership of CAN in their political meeting. “This is totally unacceptable, reprehensible, unprecedented and ungodly. If they are saying Christians have no electoral values, why impersonating them in their meetings? We are throwing their principals and sponsors into the court of conscience. “These actions  of theirs have shown who they are to the public and what they are capable of doing to us all. “We are asking political parties not to ignore religious sensibilities and sensibilities of the people, especially in today’s Nigeria, when Christians are becoming endangered species daily. “Our quest is within the constitutional requirements and ignoring it is like trampling on the Constitution especially the Federal Character Act. “At the fullness of time, we will direct our members nationwide on how to use their Permanent Voters Cards come 2023.”
