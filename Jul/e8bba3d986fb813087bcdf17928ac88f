The lingering crisis over who is the authentic Kano State governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party has yet to subside. The Independent National Electoral Commission had listed Sadiq Wali as the governorship candidate of the party on Friday, rather than Muhammad Abacha, who emerged at the party’s primary election supervised by the electoral body. Following the development, the Kano PDP factional Chairman, Shehu Sagagi, hinted on Friday night that Abacha, who was aggrieved, would challenge INEC’s decision in court. Sadiq is the son of a former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Aminu Wali, while Muhammad is the son of a former Head of State, the late General Sani Abacha. On June 30, 2022, the Kano Resident Electoral Commissioner, Prof Risqua Shehu, said the primary election of the PDP that produced Abacha was the recognised primary of the factional PDP, pointing out that the electoral body observed and monitored the exercise. According to Shehu, the commission monitored the party’s primary, which produced Abacha because with the letter served on the body, the party headquarters, the Shehu Wada Sagagi faction was the side recognised by the law, with respect to a court judgement. Meanwhile, Sagagi claimed that Abacha confirmed to him that he was set to challenge the list released by INEC that omitted his name. ‘’We have contacted INEC in Kano and we were informed that Muhammad Abacha was the name forwarded to the headquarters of the commission, not Sadiq Wali. You see, the electoral body gave the national chairmen of each political party a code to upload the names of candidates of their parties who won their primaries to the commission’s portal,” Sagagi added. It would be recalled that Abacha suffered a similar fate in 2011 when he was allegedly denied the governorship ticket of the Congress for Progressive Change.
