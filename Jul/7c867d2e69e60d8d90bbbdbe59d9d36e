The Chairman, Anambra State Christian Association of Nigeria, Joseph Nweke, has described the outcome of the Osun State governorship election as a manifestation of God’s intervention in Nigerian politics, and reform in the electoral system. Nweke said the way the election went showed that God did not want people to over-empower themselves. The cleric spoke in Onitsha on Tuesday while also commending the lawmakers for embarking on electoral reform, which he said, aimed at restoring parity in the electioneering processes in the country. Nweke, who is also the Archdeacon of Onitsha Inland Archdeaconry, said the winner, Senator Ademola Adeleke, became the first beneficiary of the new electoral system in Nigeria. He said, “When I heard that Adeleke won the election, two things came to my mind. There is what I would call the hand of God in the election. It is not an easy thing to defeat an incumbent in any election. “Osun is a Christian/Muslim state. From what I heard, Osun has over 65% Christian and 35% Muslim and Adeleke is a Christian. “So, for them to survive, they are working towards their faith. However, the religious politics in the country is growing wings. So, to me, God is at work in Nigeria, starting from Osun State. “How can you tell me that a serving governor of a state who has the state’s economy at his disposal, could lose the election in such a devastating manner? There is the hand of God in the process and God is taking us to the next level that we have not yet gotten to.” The cleric also encouraged Nigerians to get their Permanent Voter Cards and get ready to effect the needed change they want in 2023. He added that CAN as a body had not endorsed any candidate but the people should vote for the right persons that could lead the country out of its present situation.
