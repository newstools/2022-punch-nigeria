The Peter Obi Support Network has unveiled plans to hold a summit for the presidential candidate and running mate of the Labour Party. The group said the programme was specifically designed to interact with supporters of the presidential candidates across the 19 Northern states of the country. In a statement on Sunday, the Spokesman of the group, Comrade Sani Altukry, said the summit was not a political campaign, but a converge of volunteers and would-be volunteers and supporters of the ObiDatti project, for necessary interaction and cross-fertilization of ideas. Altukry added that the programme will hold in Kaduna State with members of the public whose ideas align with the concept of a new and working Nigeria. He said the occasion would also afford the support groups an opportunity to have an interface, for the first time, and strategise for better prosecution of the forthcoming general elections. He said, “The summit is not a political campaign of any sort, but a converge of volunteers and would-be volunteers and supporters of the ObiDatti project, for necessary interaction and cross-fertilisation of ideas. “The occasion will also afford the support groups the opportunity to celebrate the birthday of Peter Obi as well as avail an opportunity to have an interface, for the first time, and strategise for better prosecution of the forthcoming general elections. “The event is billed to hold on July 19, at the popular Arewa House, Raba Road, Kaduna, Kaduna State.
