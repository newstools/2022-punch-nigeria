The Kwara State House of Assembly at its plenary on Tuesday pardoned the only Peoples Democratic Party member in the House, Raheem Agboola, who was suspended last year for criticising the state government. Agboola was sent on indefinite suspension in July 2021 when he alleged on a radio programme that the All Progressives Congress’ government led by the governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, did not rehabilitate the road in Ilorin South constituency which he represented in the Assembly. However, Agboola was pardoned by the Assembly after writing a letter of apology to the Assembly in which he tendered unreserved apology for gross misconduct to members and Governor AbdulRazaq for telling lies on the radio programme. The Speaker, Yakubu Danladi-Salihu, who acknowledged and read the letter of apology from Agboola, said he (Agboola) expressed readiness to make amends with all members of the Assembly and work for the progress and development of the state. The Speaker, who said Agboola had exhibited remorse and accepted that he was wrong for making the remarks on the radio programme, said the suspension order on him had been lifted. “Mr. Speaker acknowledged and read a letter of apology from Hon. Jimoh Raheem Agboola (Ilorin South) wherein the Hon. Member expressed readiness to make amends with all Hon. members and work for the progress and development of the state together. “Mr. Speaker appreciated the remorse exhibited by Hon. Agboola and the suspension order on Hon Jimoh Raheem Agboola was thereafter lifted after a unanimous vote of the House,” he said.
