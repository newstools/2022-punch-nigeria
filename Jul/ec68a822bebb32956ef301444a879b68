In a bid to stem the tide of partial or total collapse of buildings under construction in Lagos State, the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Idris Salako, has called on-site supervisors of buildings under construction across the state to pay adequate attention to structural integrity while carrying out their building projects. A statement signed by the Head of Public Affairs, Lagos Building Control Agency, Adetayo Asagba, said Dr Salako made the appeal recently, following a review of construction activities in different parts of the state geared towards bringing to the barest minimum, incidents of building collapse, especially buildings under construction. According to the commissioner, a preliminary investigation into reasons for the collapse of buildings under construction revealed that the propping used during construction was often not properly placed. Speaking further, Dr. Salako emphasised the importance of proper placement of props, especially at the stage of casting in order to avoid errors that could ultimately result in collapse. He urged all site supervisors, owners/developers of construction works and other relevant built industry professionals to always pay proper attention to propping and observe the appropriate timing for casting in order to avoid building collapse.
