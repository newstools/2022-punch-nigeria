National Youth Leader of the African Democratic Congress, Barr. Maurice Ebam, on Thursday, resigned his membership with about 50,000 loyalists. Ebam’s resignation is coming about three weeks after the presidential aspirant of the party, Kingsley Moghalu, dumped the party over alleged poor handling of the primary elections held in Abeokuta. According to a letter which was made available to our correspondent and addressed to the National Chairman of the party, Ebam said the party had been a training ground for him. The letter read, “The ADC DNA is in my system. ADC has been a learning school for me. I did not just serve; I also learnt. It is a platform that has given opportunities to young people who are willing and I was given an opportunity to serve. It is clearly documented and posterity bears witness. “It is with mixed feelings that I resign my membership of ADC. While serving both as a member and youth leader, I sacrificed my time and resources, and even put my career on the hold willingly and selflessly for the cause of nation-building with ADC as the platform. Now it’s time to contribute to nation-building, albeit on another platform.” Ebam promised to provide relevant assistance, revealing that he would leave the party with his foot soldiers. “I have gathered over 50,000 passionate, organic and dedicated grassroot youths that will be moving with me following my consultation with youths from diverse strata, and various youth movements, and we have all unanimously concluded that decamping from ADC is the best option at this time. “This is not a goodbye letter, as I will be available to render assistance to the best of my ability when beckoned on. Please, accept the assurance of my best wishes,” Ebam added.
