The Field Commander, Osun State Amotekun Corps, Amitolu Shittu, on Friday, urged operatives of the corps to comport themselves in a peaceful manner during the governorship election on Saturday. In a statement on Friday, Shittu asked the operatives to go along to their polling units with their “tested and confirmed African Science materials”. “You must conduct yourself in a peaceful manner devoid of any controversy as the law has no respect for violators”. “You are to perform your civic right in mufti. Do not go to any polling unit with any material except your voter’s card. Remember to have with you all your tested and confirmed African Science materials. “All your observations and reports must be sent to #Amotekunosunsituationbase. In case any of you foresees or discovers any looming crisis in your polling unit of observation, you are to relay the information to the Police officer around, the Department of State Service officer and other accredited professional security officers saddled with election monitoring responsibilities,” the statement read. Shittu charged the area commanders and local government commanders of Amotekun in the state to “conduct and organise the men under them very peacefully”.
