The All Progressives Congress National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, on Wednesday, assured Christians that they had nothing to fear with the joint ticket of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and Senator Kashim Shettima for the 2023 presidential election. He said the party’s Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket was “the work and the will of God.” Adamu made the declaration in Daura when he led the party’s National Working Committee on a Sallah visit to the President, Major-General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). He also told journalists that he and his team were in Daura to brief the President on what transpired in Osun State on Tuesday during the APC governorship mega rally campaign. Adamu explained that the party went through a “rigorous practical assignment during the selection process” on the presidential/ vice-presidential ticket. He described Shettima as a bonafide Nigerian who did not need to be either Muslim or Christian before being considered for a position he was qualified for. Adamu appreciated Christians in Nigeria for showing interest in the Muslim-Muslim ticket. He added, “APC is working hard and praying to win the forthcoming 2023 general election. We are also confident to win the Saturday’s Osun governorship election.” Meanwhile, Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State also reacted to Shettima’s emergence as Tinubu’s running mate, describing him (Shettima) as an “intellectual, brilliant and accommodating person with all the qualities to be considered as the Vice President.” Masari said he was in full support of Shettima’s nomination. He said, “What is most important is for a leader to be good, just and fair, irrespective of his faith and wherever he comes from.” The governor also assured Christians that they had nothing to fear, adding “we assure you of good governance come 2023.”
