The Nigeria Labour Congress has said it is not necessary for its leadership to inform the police about its two-day nationwide protest scheduled for July 26 and 27, 2022. The protest is in solidarity with the striking members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities and other unions in the public universities. The union insisted that it was not stipulated in the law that the police must be notified about protests in the country. The PUNCH earlier reported that the congress had in a circular signed by the NLC President, Ayuba Wabba and the General Secretary, Emmanuel Ugboaja, dated July 15, 2022, informed its affiliates about the street rally to pressure the government to accede to ASUU’s demands. The protests would hold in all the state capitals and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The Force Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, had in an interview with The PUNCH, advised the organised labour to notify the police so that the force can deploy security operatives for the rally. “It is always advisable for the police to be informed before a protest. This is to provide security for the protesters and to prevent the protest from being hijacked by hoodlums. All we require is the day they are to have the protest, the routes and the purpose of the protest,” he had said. However, responding to the police’s demand on Monday, the Assistant General-Secretary, NLC, Echezona Asuzu, waved off Adejobi’s statement, stating that the union is not under any legal obligation to tell the police about its rally. “We don’t need to inform them (the police); there is nothing in the law that says we need to inform the police. It is a matter of courtesy,” Asuzu said. When asked if the congress would tell the police about the protest, he said he cannot answer the question.
