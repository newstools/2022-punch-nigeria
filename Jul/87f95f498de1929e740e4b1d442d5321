After missing out on the likes of Raphinha and Lisandro Martinez, Arsenal have got their transfer window back on track by completing the signing of Oleksandr Zinchenko from Manchester City. The Gunners have been keen on the Ukraine international for much of the summer, with Zinchenko able to add both quality and versatility to the Gunners’ squad. Arsenal have paid a reported initial £30 million ($36m) fee to bring Zinchenko to the Emirates Stadium, with a potential £2m ($2.4m) due in add-ons if certain targets are met. The 25-year-old has signed a four-year contract with Arsenal, with that deal set to keep him in north London through to the summer of 2026. Zinchenko has spent much of his time at City providing cover at left-back, with Pep Guardiola having been keen to make the most of his energetic style and ability in possession. Given Kieran Tierney’s track record with injuries, there is a decent chance that Zinchenko will have to fill in at that position over the course of his Arsenal career, but he has been signed primarily as a central midfielder. Playing for Ukraine, Zinchenko acts as a play-making No.8, and it is in this role that Arsenal will look to utilise him most as they look to create more chances for the likes of Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Zinchenko’s fellow new arrival from City, Gabriel Jesus.
