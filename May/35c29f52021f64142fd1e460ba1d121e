The Federal Government has approved N3bn sukuk bond for the rehabilitation of the Jalingo-Numan Road, the Minister of State for Works and Housing, Alhaji Muazu Sambo, has said. Sambo disclosed this on Friday during an inspection of Federal roads under construction within Taraba and Adamawa states. He blamed the delay in the completion of the road on the paucity of funds occasioned by COVID-19, and assured that the N3bn would be released to the contractor handling the project in July. “The funds would go a long way in executing the project, but I must warn the contractor to sit up and work towards completing the project in good time or get sacked.” Representative of the company handling the project, Mr Frank Kohshola, in a remark said only N1.5bn was given to the company after the contract was awarded since 2017, even as he blamed insecurity for the slow pace of the work. Our correspondent reports that the 103.5-kilometre Jalingo-Numan Road was awarded in March 2017 and the project was expected to be completed in July 2019. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
