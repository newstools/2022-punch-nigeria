Former Ogun State governor and Senator representing Ogun Central District, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, on Thursday in Abuja, declared to vie for the All Progressives Congress presidential ticket in the forthcoming primaries from May 30 to June 1, 2022. Amosun declared his intention to run a few minutes past 1:00 pm at the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Centre, Abuja. He said, “Today, I am formally announcing my candidacy for the Presidential ticket of our great party, the All Progressives Congress and the Presidency of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “I do so conscious of the immensity of the tasks that lie ahead in our country and the magnitude of the sacrifices that anybody who wishes to lead our country into the next phase must make. “This is to honour a historic call and duty to lead the next phase of our collective journey to national glory. It is a duty to reenergise our faith in the future of this country even in the face of the threats to our national sovereignty by insurgents and terrorists; a duty to renew hope in our collective destiny even in the light of some doubts expressed and mobilised in some quarters about our shared fate.” In attendance were his wife, Olufunso Amosun, the representative of the First Lady, Aisha Buhari, Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, and lawmakers from both chambers of the national assembly.
