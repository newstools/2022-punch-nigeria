A staunch ally of former Governor Bola Tinubu, Nuhu Ribadu, lost the All Progressives Congress governorship primary in Adamawa State to Senator Aisha Binani. Ribadu, who is the pioneer Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, came second in the primary, polling 288 votes while Binani got 430. The immediate past Governor, Jibrilla Bindo, came third with 103 votes while Abdulrazaq Namdas, a serving member of the House of Representatives came 4th. Binani, who was the only female governorship aspirant, is the first woman to win a governorship ticket in any of the major political parties in Adamawa State. In 2014, Senator Aisha Alhassan aka Mama Taraba, won the governorship ticket of the APC in Taraba State but lost to Governor Darius Ishaku in the main election. Both western nations and rights groups have in recent times been pushing for more women’s participation in politics in Nigeria. Currently, women occupy less than 10 per cent of elective offices in Nigeria. The refusal of the National Assembly to pass bills that would have guaranteed greater women’s participation sparked a series of protests in March. Binani, a graduate of Electrical Engineering at the University of Southampton is currently the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Sustainable Development Goals and is a staunch advocate for women empowerment and gender equality.
