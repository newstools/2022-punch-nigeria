A Kaduna Chief Magistrates’ Court, on Thursday, sentenced a 35-year-old man,  Waziri Gambo, to six months imprisonment for impersonating a court clerk. Gambo, who resides in Kawo, Kaduna State, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and impersonation, and begged for leniency. Magistrate Ibrahim Emmanuel gave the convict an option to pay a fine of N20,000. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Insp. Chidi Leo told the court that the convict, and one other at large, portrayed themselves as court clerk, a representation they knew to be false. He said the convict and his accomplice are in the habit of collecting money from litigants, pretending to be court officials. Leo noted that the offence contravened the provisions of Sections 57 and 261 of the Kaduna State Penal Code. NAN
