The Nigerian Army said troops of the 34 Brigade Obinze killed four suspected members of the Indigenous People of Biafra during a gun duel in Orlu local government area of Imo state. The Army said the suspected IPOB members opened fire on its troops who were on patrol in the area, adding that the troops overpowered them afterward. These were contained in a statement on Monday by the Director of Army Public Relations, Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu. The statement read, “Troops of the 34 Brigade Obinze have neutralised four members of the Indigenous People of Biafra and its armed wing, Eastern Security Network, in a fierce encounter that ensued at Amaifeke and Ihioma in Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State. “The terrorists were taken out today, Monday, May 16, 2022, while shooting sporadically, threatening lives and property of innocent citizens. “The irate dissidents opened fire on sighting the patrol team, who were out to ensure safety and security of lives and property of citizens. “The vigilant troops engaged the criminals and neutralised four of them, while others succumbed to the superior firepower of the troops and escaped from the scene. “Items recovered from the encounter include one pump action gun, 10 live cartridges, one Hilux truck, which was reportedly snatched at gunpoint yesterday by the irredentists, some mobile handsets and charms.” Copyright PUNCH.
