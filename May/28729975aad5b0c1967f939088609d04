Grammy-winning British singer, Ed Sheeran, and his wife, Cherry, have welcomed a baby girl. The singer made the announcement on his Instagram page late Thursday, where he shared a picture of white baby socks. In his announcement, he noted that he and his wife were excited to now have a family of four. The family welcomed their first daughter, Lyra, in August 2020. Announcing their second child, Ed wrote, “We want to let you all know we’ve had another beautiful baby girl. We are both so in love with her, and over the moon to be a family of four.” Ed and Cherry got married in February 2019 in an intimate ceremony with just 40 guests. In August 2020, Ed had announced the birth of their first daughter. Also sharing a picture of baby socks, the new father had announced Lyra’s birth on Instagram saying, “Ello! A quick message from me as I have some personal news that I wanted to share with you. “Last week, with the help of an amazing delivery team, Cherry gave birth to our beautiful and healthy daughter – Lyra Antarctica Seaborn Sheeran. We are completely in love with her. Both mum and baby are doing amazing and we are on cloud nine over here.” With their latest addition, the singer’s family has become a “family of four.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
