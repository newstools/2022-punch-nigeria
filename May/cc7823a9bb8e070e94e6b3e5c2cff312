The mother of slain Ogun hairstylist, Tunrayo Odubanjo, has alleged that her daughter’s boss, Titilayo Balogun is promiscuous and encourages her apprentices to follow in her footsteps. Mrs Odubanjo claimed that Balogun used to hold birthday parties in hotels and pimp her apprentices to men. Countering Mrs Odubanjo’s claim, Balogun denied influencing her apprentices to behave badly, stating that the girls were not well trained in their homes. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
