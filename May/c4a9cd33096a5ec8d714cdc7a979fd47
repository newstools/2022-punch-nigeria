Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen, has hinted that he will be staying at the club despite interests from top European clubs especially teams in the English Premier League. Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Newcastle United have been in the race to sign the Nigeria international but the Italian giants are holding off for at least €100m for the 23-year old, who joined the side from Lille for an African record €81m in 2020. Osimhen has been in superb form this season, scoring 17 goals in 30 appearances in all competitions for Partenopei, the most by any Napoli player. Despite his form, Napoli’s wait for a first Scudetto title since 1990 continues after they once again missed out on a chance of winning, leaving Milan and Inter as forerunners for the championship, after losing ground to the two Milan giants. Speaking ahead of the future, Osimhen hinted he would like to stay at the club beyond the current campaign. “I hope to stay and continue on this road with the manager in the next few years.” Osimhen’s manager Luciano Spaletti’s job has been on the line after their failure to win the title and the Nigeria international has credited the Italian for helping to improve his game. “Spalletti is a top manager and, along with his staff, they really helped me to improve my game,” Osimhen told Radio Kiss Kiss.
