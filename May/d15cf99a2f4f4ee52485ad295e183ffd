The Nasarawa state police command says it has arrested Ibrahim Hassan, a 42-year-old man for kidnapping a herdsman in the Awe Local Government Area of the state, and collected a ransom of N10 million before he was released. Our correspondent gathered that the suspect who is the gang leader of a kidnapping syndicate, abducted the victim, a 23-year-old man whose name was mentioned as Abubakar Babiri at his Ruga while he was grazing his cattle. The Police Public Relations Officer of the command, ASP Ramhan Nansel, disclosed this while speaking to our correspondent in Lafia on Wednesday. He said “The Police received information that one Abubakar Babiri, a 23-year-old herdsman of Jangwa village in Awe LGA of the state was abducted at his Ruga by unknown armed men. He and his family were made to pay the sum of N10 million as ransom before he was released. “Upon receipt of the information, the command’s anti-kidnapping unit was deployed to carry out an extensive investigation into the matter and arrest the perpetrators of the act. “Consequently, while acting on credible intelligence, the gang leader of the kidnapping syndicate, Ibrahim Hassan (AKA Bature), a 42-year-old man was arrested, and upon interrogation, the suspect confessed to the commission of the offence. “He further stated that he took N5 million as his share of the ransom collected and shared the rest to his boys who are presently at large and efforts are being made to arrest them.” While warning criminal elements to leave the state without further delay, the PPRO said the Commissioner of Police, CP Adesina Soyemi, had directed that the case should be thoroughly investigated at the State Criminal Investigation Department in Lafia.
