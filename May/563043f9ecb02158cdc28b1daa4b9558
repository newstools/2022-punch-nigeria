Cross River State Governor, Prof Ben Ayade, has sacked the Muri Munene of the Efut nation and paramount ruler of Calabar South, Itam Hogan Itam. He was said to have allegedly contravened Section 30, Sub-section 3 of the Cross River State Traditional Edict No. 14 of 1978 by attending a meeting of Cross River State Southern Senatorial District Peoples Democratic Party caucus where a governorship candidate, Arthur Jarvis Archibong, was allegedly endorsed. The monarch was also alleged to have also voted at the meeting and signed the attendance register. The meeting was allegedly presided over by a former state governor, Donald Duke. The paramount ruler of Bakassi Local Government Area and Chairman, CRS Traditional Rulers Council, Etinyin Edet, had advised that monarchs should avoid partisan politics. The governor ordered the withdrawal of the monarch’s certificate of recognition in a letter addressed to the paramount ruler dated May 11, 2022 and signed by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Chieftaincy Affairs, Mr Adoga Victor.
