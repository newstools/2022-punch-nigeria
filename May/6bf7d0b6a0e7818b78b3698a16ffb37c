The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council on Monday said it has endorsed the national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, for president in the 2023 general elections. Addressing journalists after its meeting in Enugu, the leader of Council, Miracle Nwosu, said his members were delighted to identify with the APC chieftain as the foremost national political leader in contemporary Nigeria and political dispensation, “who is in the forefront of providing good governance and dividends of democracy in our developing society.” Nwosu stated that having carefully extolled Tinubu’s visionary leadership qualities, forthrightness, and uncommon courage, he would surely lead Nigerian youth and the nation to greater heights and out of economic peril. He said, “It is in the light of this, we call all his party delegates in their party upcoming 2022 APC presidential primaries, especially southeast delegates to vote and ensure His Excellency Asiwaju Bola Tinubu emerges as the presidential flag bearer of APC. “If he becomes President, Igbo nation and her youth will benefit more, which he demonstrated when he was the former Governor of Lagos state. So I urge our Igbo brothers from South East to support his candidature because he has impacted more in the lives of our people who are doing businesses in Lagos State.” Nwosu commended Tinubu for being an exceptional politician and a distinguished leader, who has effected monumental democratic change in the country’s political evolution. “It is our sincere desire that Almighty God will grant him the enabling grace, wisdom, and protection in this strategic endeavour,” he said.
