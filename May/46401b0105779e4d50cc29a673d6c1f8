A presidential aspirant, Mohammed Hayatu-deen, has said Nigeria needs quality and seminal leadership that could provide a safe and secure environment where Nigerians, irrespective of their religion and ethnic persuasion, could flourish and excel. This is as he promised to make Nigeria work for all if given the opportunity to serve at the highest level in the country. Hayatu-deen spoke when he met with leaders and stakeholders of the Peoples Democratic Party in Adamawa State. “The country is in dire need of seminal leadership that can provide the safe, secure and stable environment for a Nigeria that works for us all,” he said. Also speaking, Director-General of the Mohammed Hayatu-deen Campaign Organisation, Senator Isa Galaudu, said the aspirant has the requisite qualities to revive the nation’s dying institutions. According to Galaudu, his effort at turning around FSB International was a testimony of his ability to handle even the most difficult of assignments. “Mohammed Hayatu-deen has the requisite capabilities to revive dying institutions, as he did with FSB International. He is contesting for the highest office because there is a special need for a special breed of leaders at this critical juncture in our history,” Galaudu said. On his part, the chairman of the Adamawa State chapter of the PDP, Abdurahman Bobboi, said the party was happy to have Hayatu-deen and wished him well on his bid for the party’s presidential ticket. “Nigerians need solutions; people who can sacrifice to put the country right. If we do not do right, we will not be forgiven by the next generation. We wish you the very best in your campaign for the party’s ticket,” Bobboi said.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
