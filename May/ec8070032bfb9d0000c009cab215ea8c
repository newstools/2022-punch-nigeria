An unidentified man has died from a fire that erupted after four vehicles collided with a fully-loaded tanker along Otedola Bridge, Lagos. His remains have been handed over to the State Environment Health Monitoring Unit for further processing. The incident occurred early on Friday morning. The unmarked tanker which was en-route Lagos-Ibadan Expressway was loaded with over 45,000 litres of petrol. According to the Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, upon arrival of the agency’s tiger team at the scene, it was observed that multiple accidents involving a tanker with an unknown registration number, conveying about 45,000 litres of petrol and four vehicles, had occurred. “A joint team of Lagos State Fire Service, the agency’s fire team and the police worked to manage the flames and the resultant traffic backlogs using chemical foam. The other affected cars were recovered by the agency’s light-duty equipment. The entire area has been blanketed with a chemical retardant to prevent secondary incidents from the product which spilt into a nearby gully. “Members of the public are to refrain from illegal scooping of product to prevent any additional outbreak and to avoid igniting naked flame or fire. “The operation has been concluded and the carriageway is open for traffic having been supported by the agency’s fire trucks and super metro. A single fatality (adult male) was discovered and the remains have been handed over to SEHMU for further processing,” part of the statement read.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
