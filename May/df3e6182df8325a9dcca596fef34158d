The Governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri, has, on Monday, expressed sadness over the demise of a prominent Ijaw leader and former Minister of Labour and Productivity, Alabo Tonye Graham-Douglas. He commiserated with the family of Graham-Douglas of Abonnema community in the Akuku-Toru Local Government Area of Rivers State. Graham-Douglas, who died a week ago in Abuja at the age of 82, was also at various times the Minister of Social Development, Youth and Sports, Aviation as well as Culture and Tourism. In a condolence message to the family of the deceased, the Bayelsa governor described him as a foremost nationalist and cultural icon. He stated that Graham-Douglas belonged to the pantheon of the Ijaw elite that made the ethnic group proud. Diri noted that the former four-time minister and exceptional politician would be greatly missed for his frankness, forthrightness, and fatherly disposition. He urged the family to take solace in the fact that Graham-Douglas lived a fulfilled and accomplished life that impacted, not only those whose path crossed with his but indeed, the whole of the Ijaw nation and Nigeria.
