Oilserv Limited, the contractor executing the ongoing Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano gas pipeline project, has said that the project is a good target to attract European markets in exploring opportunities for gas exports. The firm said this was the single largest gas project in Nigeria, expected to stimulate gas infrastructural development and industrialisation across the country. According to the News Agency of Nigeria, this was disclosed by the Chairman of Oliserv Limited, Emeka Okwuosa, during an interview on Tuesday in Abuja. Okwuosa noted that the project was aimed at transporting natural gas which would enable the production of Compressed Natural Gas, Liquefied Natural Gas,  among others. Emphasising on how the project would be beneficial to Nigeria as regards to development, he said, “Development cannot happen without energy and our greatest form of energy in terms of availability is gas. “Gas is nothing without transportation, you have to send it to where you need it and that’s what we are doing to boost development in the country. “You can see what is happening in Europe because of Russian gas, everybody is scampering, but we have it.’’ The strategic importance of the AKK gas pipeline project comes to the fore at a time Europe, the single-largest buyer of Russian energy, is weighing the likelihood of gas-supply disruptions as the war with Ukraine continues.
