This represents a 47.3 per cent increase over disbursements in 2020. “The 2021 disbursement includes N2.99bn to 22,120 farmers through the bank’s Smallholder Farmers on-lending product; and N1bn to 4,000 micro-retailers through the Bank’s Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Distributor Finance Programme. Through these interventions, an estimated 950,640 direct and indirect jobs were created in 2021.” Pitan also reaffirmed the bank’s continued efforts towards supporting its stakeholders and achieving its mandate.’ “Our commitment to building a resilient organisation that can respond to the needs of our customers and operating challenges is unwavering. We strongly believe that we can achieve this with the continuous support of all our stakeholders,” he said.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
