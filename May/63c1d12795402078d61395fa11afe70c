A commercial driver, Amodu Agbaje, has been arrested by men of the Lagos State Police Command over alleged possession of substances suspected to be Indian hemp valued at N3m in the Surulere area of the state. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin, said the suspect and two other accomplices were conveying the drug to Mushin when operatives of the Rapid Response Squad, who were on a routine patrol, accosted them at Stadium Bus Stop, Surulere. While the two accomplices fled, the policemen arrested Agbaje. Hundeyin said, “Operatives of the Lagos State Police Command have intercepted 10 bags of an illicit drug suspected to be Indian hemp. “The drug, packed in 10 sacks, was being conveyed in a Lagos colour commercial bus with number plate LND 995 XT from Iddo to a destination in Mushin. “Luck, however, ran out on the suspects when vigilant Rapid Response Squad operatives on a routine patrol stopped the bus around 4am on April 29, 2022, at Stadium Bus Stop, Surulere.” Hundeyin said during interrogation, Agbaje confessed to have been offered N25,000 to convey the drug to the Mushin area of the state. The PPRO said, “While two occupants of the vehicle escaped, the driver, Amodu Agbaje, was apprehended. The arrested driver claimed he was offered N25,000 to convey the drugs with a street value of N3,000,000.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
