The Gombe State Police Command on Tuesday said it has outlawed arbitrary use of siren by unauthorised persons, covering of number plates, refusal of motorists to ensure complete vehicle registration. The state accounts for the increase in the indiscriminate use of covered number plate among commissioners, local government chairmen, and politicians especially when they are in transit. However, covering of number plate contravenes section 10 (4) (h) and 10 (4) (s) of the FRSC (Establishment) Act, 2007 as well as sections 36 and 39 of the National Road Traffic Regulations (NRTR) 2012 of the state. Confirming the decision of the command the Public Relations Officer Mahid Abubakar said such acts would no longer be condoned, adding that it was geared towards ensuring safety. Abubakar said, “The command under the watch of the Commissioner of Police CP Ishola Babaita wishes to inform members of the general public that it has observed with concern the indiscriminate use of covered number plate, unregistered vehicles, revolving lights, and sirens within the State. “The Command thereby warned that anybody found flouting Road Traffic Act and Traffic Laws in the State will be dealt with in accordance with the laws of the land.” Abubakar also called on the residents, to adhere to the rules, stressing that defaulters would be properly sanctioned. “We hereby call on the good people of the state to halt from violating this order as officers and men of the Command in collaboration with other traffic enforcement agencies will be all out to enforce this order by seizing sirens, impounding vehicles with covered number plate and unregistered vehicles and also to arrest violators for prosecution please,” Abubakar said.
