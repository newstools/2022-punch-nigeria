Stakeholders of the Plateau South
All Progressives Congress has endorsed the state governor, Simon Lalong, as their candidate in the constituency’s senatorial seat, ahead of the 2023 elections. The APC stakeholders from the three local government areas of Quan-Pan, Shendam, Mikang, met with Laong on Tuesday in Jos, and asked the governor to accede to the peoples’ demand and stand as the party’s candidate in the next general elections. Chairman of the forum, Joseph Ari, while expressing the position of the meeting, held that the entire stakeholders, including youth and women groups and other members of the party, were well pleased with the sterling performance of the governor in the state. This was contained in a statement made available to The PUNCH on Wednesday. The statement quoted Ari as saying, “Gov Lalong has impacted positively on the lives of our people and we call on all lovers of peace to support him irrespective of party affiliation in order to benefit from his wealth of experience and varied contacts.” The motion was seconded by the Majority Leader of the Plateau State House of Assembly, Naanlong Daniel. Ari, who is the current Director General of the Industrial Training Fund also extended an invitation to all supporters and well wishers of the governor, to grace the formal presentation of the Expression of Interest and Nomination forms to Lalong on Saturday 7th May 2022, in Shendam, headquarters of Plateau South Senatorial Zone.
