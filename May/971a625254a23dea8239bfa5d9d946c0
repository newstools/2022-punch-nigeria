The Lagos State Police Command has arraigned an ex-Nigerian athlete, Gladys Stephen, and her lawyer, Emeka Nwosu, over alleged N10.5m fraud. A travel agent, Osuji Onyedikanne, had accused Stephen of using her company, Golden Knights International Sports Limited, to defraud her after promising to send her clients for a foreign football trial. The allegation was denied by both Nwosu and Stephen. They were, however, arraigned on two counts bordering on fraud and conspiracy before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. The charges read, “That you, Gladys Gift Stephen, Emeka Nwosu Charles, and one other now at large in February 2022 at the Surulere area of Lagos in the Lagos Magisterial District, did conspire among yourselves to commit felony, to wit: obtaining money under false pretences, thereby committing an offence punishable under Section 325 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State of Nigeria, 2015. “That you, Gladys Stephen, Emeka Nwosu Charles, and one other now at large, on the same date, time and place, in the aforesaid magisterial district, did with intent to defraud Osuji Onyedaknne fraudulently obtain from her the sum of N10,500,000 under the pretence that you wanted to use the money to register a sports management company in Spain, knowing same to be false, thereby committing an offence punishable under Section 314 (3) of the Criminal Code Law of Lagos State.” The Magistrate, O. I. Raji, granted the suspects bail in the sum of N2m. The case was adjourned till May 27. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
