Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has said he believes Mohammed Hayatu-deen, one of the presidential aspirants on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, has the knowledge to manage Nigeria’s complexities and turn the country around for better. Speaking when the aspirant and his team visited him at his hilltop mansion in Ota, Ogun State, recently, Obasanjo stated that contrary to some people’s claims, Nigeria was not a difficult country to manage if the right things were done. He added, “I believe you have the knowledge from what you have said and you have the dedication. You told me you have the innovation, but let me add that Nigeria is a complex country and we need to understand the complexity of Nigeria. “Nigeria is not a difficult country to manage but we must all be ready to satisfy our conscience, know that whatever we do we are responsible to God and that the complexity will be addressed. If these are taken care of; the sky is the limit to which we can take Nigeria, and I believe we have no choice but to get there. You have shown that you can make a contribution, be a team leader and reach out both internally and externally.” Hayatu-deen, who is one of the 14 aspirants contesting the party’s primary in Abuja between Saturday and Sunday, said he had undergone tutelage under statesmen like Obasanjo and other Heads of State. He noted that the task of rebuilding Nigeria required the efforts of all Nigerians.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
