The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali-Baba, has given an order for the punishment of one Corporal Isaac Matthew, currently serving in Ebonyi State, who was arrested for gyrating to a confraternity song in a viral video. Isaac was caught on video, dressed in the Nigeria Police Force uniform, singing and dancing while brandishing his rifle as the gyration song played in the background. The Force spokesperson, Muyiwa Adejobi, said in a statement that Matthew acted contrary to the ethics of the Nigeria Police Force. Adejobi said the corporal also violated the provisions of the NPF Social Media Policy, penal laws, and other extant laws regulating the conduct and discipline of all policemen. He said, “The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali-Baba, has directed the Commissioner of Police in charge of Ebonyi State to detail the Command’s OC Provost to hand over the erring officer to the Force Provost Marshall for necessary disciplinary actions. “The act of the officer in question, which is clearly calculated to portray the NPF negatively, is discreditable conduct in line with the provisions of the First Schedule to Regulation 370 of the Police Regulations. His actions equally violated the provisions of the NPF Social Media Policy, penal laws, and other extant laws regulating the conduct and discipline of all police officers.”  Copyright PUNCH.
