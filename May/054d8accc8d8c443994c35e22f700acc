Record-breaking Nigerian dancer, Kafayat Shafau, popularly known as Kaffy, has revealed that she stopped having sex with her husband three years before their divorce. The mother-of-two made this known in an interview with media personality, Chude Jideonwo, published on Saturday. Kaffy had caused a stir on the Internet when she opened up about her divorce in January 2022. In the latest interview, she claimed that her husband cheated on her with her best friend and she started healing when she stopped sleeping with her husband. “Let me tell you when I started healing; when I stopped sleeping with my husband,” she said. Kaffy added, “I was celibate in my marriage for three years before getting a divorce.” According to her, she understood that marriage was an alignment of assignment. “There are different kinds of red flags that we women in love are so blinded by,” the dancer noted. She added, “I was thinking in the beginning that I have found someone else that would make me happy. That’s the most selfish thinking that any human being can have for another human being.” Kaffy also opened up about the domestic violence that prevailed in her parents’ marriage. She noted that her parents used sharp objects like knives and forks when they were fighting. The dancer noted that at a point, she and her siblings had to hide sharp objects in the house to avoid their parents from hurting each other. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
