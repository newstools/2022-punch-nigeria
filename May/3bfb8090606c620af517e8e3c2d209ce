The leaders of the All Progressives Congress in Owo Local Government Area of Ondo State have condemned the attack on the member of the House of Assembly representing Owo Constituency 2, Mr Oluwole Ogunmolasuyi. Ogunmolasuyi was allegedly attacked by some suspected thugs in Owo, the headquarters of Owo Local Government but the lawmaker said he was not at the scene of the attack. He alleged that the attack was sponsored by the members of the opposition party to disrupt a ward meeting he was to attend. The state governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, who held a meeting with the leaders of the party in the constituency on Thursday evening, said the leaders and elders of the party in the community condemned the attack. Akeredolu, who described the attackers as miscreants, warned that such a dastardly act would not be condoned in the local government area and in the state in general henceforth. He said, “As you can see, we have held a meeting of leaders, elders of APC in Owo Local Government Area. We deemed it fit to hold this meeting so that we can explain development to the people in Owo. “We held meeting of the State Working Committee and elders of the party yesterday and we arrived at some conclusions into where the party is going. That decision is what we have come to communicate to Owo leaders and elders. They have given assurances that they will go with the party decision. The APC leaders at the meeting  also declared that Ogunmolasuyi has performed creditably well in his constituency and has delivered beyond expectations.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
