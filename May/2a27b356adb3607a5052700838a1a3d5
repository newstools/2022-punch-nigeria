A group of youths under the aegis of Concerned Abia Peoples Democratic Party has asked the chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in Abia State, Chief Asiforo Okere, to resign following alleged move to make the party unpopular in the state. Speaking through its leader, Comrade O’Brien Iroh, the group said their grievances, which included, but not limited to, the ward 3-man ad hoc delegate election, which was rumoured to be held on Tuesday. The youths demanded to know when the forms for the purported delegate election was sold and why they were kept in the dark regarding the conduct of the delegate election. The leader of the protest queried the chairman and insisted that if it was true that forms were sold, it was never advertised and that the people were not aware, and accused the chairman for not protecting the interest of the party. He wondered why the House of Assembly forms were sold in Abia State whereas delegate forms worth N10,000 would be sold in Abuja, demanding the rationale behind such decision. While responding, the chairman of the party in the state, Asiforo Okere, said the delegate forms were sold in Abuja, and that it was the National Secretariat that sold the forms. The chairman thanked the group for their decorum and peaceful disposition and urged them to close ranks with each other to ensure that PDP retained power in Abia and reclaimed the mandate in Abuja.
