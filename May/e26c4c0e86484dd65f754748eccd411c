The Concerned Parents and Educators Network, led by Yinka Ogunde, has facilitated the construction and furnishing of a house for a teacher living with disability, Audu Jiya. According to Ogunde, the CPEN, which was founded four years ago, embraced Jiya as a member because of his exploits in his community. Jiya is a rural area educator and girl child education advocate in his community, Ekpan-mawo Kataeregi, in the Katcha Local Government Area of Niger State. Speaking to The PUNCH, Jiya said the group recognised his contribution to his community and decided to reward him with a house of his own, built from the ground up. He said, “After my four years of activities in group and my community, the founder of the group Mrs. Yinka Ogunde, came up with a suggestion to build me a personal house, solicited for funds from group members both home and abroad. The house is now truly completed. “I am grateful and appreciate the impact Mrs. Ogunde is making in my life, only God can repay her and the donors, from the depth of my heart. “I am very happy right now because it’s my first property achievement of my life. I will not longer beg for where to sleep.” In a Facebook post on her part, Mrs. Ogunde advised people to do good even if no one was watching. The educationist expressed gratitude to members of the group who put money together to make Jiya’s dream a reality. “Always believe. Great things still happen, always believe that God still works in the affairs of men. I am truly delighted that we have been able to provide this diligent teacher on a wheelchair a house,” she wrote.
