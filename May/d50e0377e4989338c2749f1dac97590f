Suspected gunmen have abducted a farmer in Ukpor, in the Nnewi South Local Government Area of Anambra State. Although the reason behind the abduction of the victim, identified as Chukwujekwu Uzozie, was unknown as of the time of filing this report, it was gathered that he was a special adviser to a former chairman in the local government area. A source said Uzozie’s only son was shot by the attackers. Sunday PUNCH gathered that the gunmen stormed the farmer’s home in Umudiji Umuohama village on Saturday and shot into the air several times before invading his apartment. It was further learnt that he was taken to an unknown destination and his family had yet to be contacted. According to the source, members of the St. Andrew’s Church, Umuoham, where the victim worshiped, organised special prayers for his release and quick recovery of his only son. The state police spokesman, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, confirmed the incident and said a manhunt had been launched to arrest the abductors. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
