The University of Nigeria Nsukka has tasked technology firms and scientists to find solutions to security challenges bedeviling Nigeria as is the case in developed countries. The Nigeria premier university gave the charge during the unveiling of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) laboratory donated to the Electronic Engineering department of the Faculty of Engineering by Byteworks Technology Solutions Ltd, a firm owned by an alumnus of the university. Vice Chancellor of UNN, Prof Charles Igwe, gave the charge when the Management of Byteworks led by Mr Ezeukwu Osuagwu paid him a courtesy call shortly before the unveiling ceremony on Friday. Byteworks Ltd, in a statement signed by Mabel Amoke, and made available to our correspondent on Wednesday, said the vice chancellor was represented by the Deputy Vice Chancellor, Administration, Prof Patrick Okpoko. While he noted that Artificial Intelligence (AI) engineering was a relatively new field that was becoming more and more important in various industries, especially in the industrial and manufacturing contexts, the VC charged the firm and others in the sector to deploy such labs in addressing local problems.
