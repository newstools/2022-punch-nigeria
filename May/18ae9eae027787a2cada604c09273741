Honourable Erhiatake Ibori-Suenu, daughter of former Governor of Delta State, James Ibori, on Tuesday polled 46 votes against her rival, Hon. Ben Igbakpa, who scored only 22 votes in the Peoples Democratic Party run-off primaries election for the Ethiope Federal Constituency of Delta. Hon. Ben Igbakpa, the serving lawmaker representing the constituency, is widely believed to be the favourite candidate of the incumbent Governor of the State, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa. “The contest was between Ibori and Okowa NOT Ben Igbakpa and Erhitake”, Fejiro Oliver, a notable PDP leader in Delta State posted on his Facebook page shortly after the result of the run-off election conducted at Oghara Township Stadium, was announced. He added, “The only candidate Okowa and I were on same page with was Ben Igbakpa. Till this very morning, Okowa’s instruction was for Ben to be voted in by delegates. This I can tell you for free”. Recall that both Hon. Erhiatake Ibori-Suenu and Hon. Ben Igbakpa, had earlier tied by scoring 34 votes respectively when the primaries was initially conducted. In another run-off election held at the Sapele Township Stadium for the Okpe/Sapele/Uvwie Federal Constituency, the former Commissioner for Water Resources, Barr. Evelyn Oboro polled 45 votes against her opponent, Chief Napoleon Gbinije, who scored 36 votes. The duo had initially scored 25 votes each, when the primaries was first conducted. Copyright PUNCH.
