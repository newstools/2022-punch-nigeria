Former President of the Senate and presidential aspirant under the Peoples Democratic Party, Anyim Pius Anyim, has stated that he would choose a woman as his vice president, ahead of the upcoming 2023 elections. Anyim made this known in a meeting with the former members of the National Working Committee of the party, in his Abuja campaign office, on Thursday. In a statement made available to The PUNCH, the former Senate President noted that PDP has always encouraged the participation of women in politics. “I will choose a woman as my vice president if I have my way,” Anyim said. The former NWC of the PDP who met with Anyim for an interactive session in his office was led by Kema Chikwe. Other chieftains in attendance include publicity secretary, Nze Fidelis Ozichukwu; former National Vice chairman, South East; Chief Shuibu Oyedekwun; among others Chikwe noted that the visit was mainly to understand what they will tell other people that makes Anyim unique and what stands him out among other aspirants. Anyim talked about his unique roles both as president of the Senate and Secretary to the Government of the Federation as his distinguishing factors. “I brought peace, I brought love and I brought understanding to the legislature and the nation at large as I stabilised the system,” he said. Anyim promised that the same principles that guided his wisdom in leading the Senate will as well determine his approach to governing the country as its President. Copyright PUNCH.
