Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, on Friday said he was more experienced than other presidential aspirants in the Peoples Democratic Party. Saraki, who spoke in Owerri, Imo State, while addressing the state chapter of the PDP ahead of the May 28/29 presidential primary of the PDP, said he was the right man for the country’s top job. He said that his antecedents as a technocrat and ex-governor of Kwara State and former Senate President had positioned him as the best person to fly the flag of the PDP for the 2023 presidential election. Saraki said, “I am a detribalised Nigerian. As a Senate President, I stood for what was right. My experience puts me high above other aspirants. I have both the executive and legislative experiences to lead Nigeria and the private sector experience too. Restructuring can’t just happen.  You need a president who is courageous to do that. As a Senate President I said that fuel subsidy was a scam. I have the courage to lead Nigeria. “The South-East and North Central have not produced President. If somebody from the South-East emerges I will support the person. Nigeria needs a team player to unite Nigeria. I am a team player.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
