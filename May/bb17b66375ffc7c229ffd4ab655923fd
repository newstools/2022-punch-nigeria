A member of the Anambra State House of Assembly, Dr. Okechukwu Okoye, has been kidnapped. The lawmaker, popularly known as “Okey Di Okey” was kidnapped late Sunday. Okoye is representing the Aguata North constituency, the same community as the governor of the state, Professor Charles Soludo. Details of his kidnap were still sketchy as of the time of filing this report, but it was gathered that the lawmaker was taken away inside his black Sienna car within his constituency. Confirming the incident, the state police spokesman, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, said the lawmaker’s black Siena bus, which he was driving before the incident, had been recovered. Ikenga said the command had launched a manhunt for the kidnappers with the aim of rescuing the lawmaker. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
