A presidential aspirant under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, Sam Ohuabunwa, has insisted that he will not bribe any of the delegates in the forth coming special congress of the party. Ohuabunwa, who spoke to correspondent in Umuahia, the Abia State capital, shortly after an interactive session with the party members in the state, said he joined the presidential race to offer a selfless service to the nation. He pointed out that although money was important to service logistics in the congress, it should not be used to bribe people to solicit their support. The industrialist said, “I will not bribe anybody in this country. I will preach my message and let you and conscience to decide on what to do because I’m not coming to seek anything for myself. “I’m coming to sacrifice myself, my comfort, my resources for the good of my country. So I don’t need to bribe people to do that sacrifice expect I’m looking for something else.” The presidential hopeful maintained that building a new Nigeria is not an uphill task to him, rather it’s the easiest thing to do. Ohuabunwa, who is a pharmacist by profession, expressed hope that Nigerians who are looking for a leader who will turn around their story and experience will vote for him to become the next president. “I believe that Nigerians are becoming wiser. Having gone round the country to talk to people, they are beginning to say we need somebody who has the right ideology, thinking, intelligence, vision competency, character and courage. “That is what I hear Nigerians saying, and money may not play all the roles in the 2023 presidential election,” he insisted.
