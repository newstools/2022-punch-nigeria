The Special Adviser to Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State on Civic Engagement, Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, has charged kinsmen of the governor from Iragbiji to reach out to other communities in the state and canvas votes for him. Oyintiloye spoke while receiving members of the Iragbiji Progressive Union, an umbrella organisation for all indigenes of the community, who paid him a courtesy visit on Monday. According to him, Oyetola’s kinsmen must show commitment to his re-election as he remained the best choice in the July 16, 2022 governorship poll. He said, “Passionately support the re-election of the governor, who is an indigene of Iragbiji like you. Reach out to more people in other communities to canvas for votes. “Mr  Governor belongs to all of us in Osun, but being an indigene of Iragbiji, you must show that aggressive desire for his return to office. He remains our best choice in the July 16 governorship poll.” Speaking earlier, the IPU chairman, Tajudeen Atoyebi, commended the governor for appointing Oyintiloye, as the head of Osun Civic Engagement Office, adding that the government has been reaching out to the residents and getting feedback from them also through the agency.
