American reality TV star, Kourtney Kardashian, had added the last name of her husband, Travis Barker, on her Instagram profile. This is coming a day after the newlywed shared pictures of her wedding on her Instagram page with the caption, “Introducing Mr and Mrs Barker.” Checks by our correspondent showed that the Keeping up with the Kardashian star has added ‘Barker’ to her name on Instagram. The duo had held a lavish wedding ceremony in Italy on Sunday, with family and friends in attendance. This was the couple’s third wedding, following an unofficial ceremony in Las Vegas which was not legally binding because the couple did not have a marriage license at the time. However, the lovebirds made it official on May 15 in a California courthouse. Their latest lavish wedding took place on the secluded terrace of a medieval castle, the Castello Brown fortress in Portofino, Italy. It was reported that the venue, which normally operates as a museum, was sealed off four days before the wedding. While this is Kourtney’s first marriage, she has three children with her ex-boyfriend Scott Disick. This will be Barker’s third marriage after his marriage with Melissa Kennedy ended in 2002, lasting less than a year. He also parted ways with ex Shanna Moakler in 2008 after four years of marriage and two children. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
