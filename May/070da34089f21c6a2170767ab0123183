Two of Napoli’s star players are still considering their future at the club and could leave at the end of the season, according to Sky in Italy. Centre-back Kalidou Koulibably has been regularly linked with Europe’s top clubs, while striker Victor Osmihen has also caught the eye and is reportedly interesting Arsenal. Napoli have not given up hope of retaining the duo and will try and persuade the pair to stay and commit their future to the club. Hibernian forward Chris Mueller will join Major League Soccer side Chicago Fire in the next 24 to 48 hours. The American joined Hibs in January and featured 15 times scoring just once, against Arbroath in the Scottish Cup. The United States international could make his debut against Atlanta United in the MLS on Saturday.
