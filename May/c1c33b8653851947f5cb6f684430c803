Edo State Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu who ran in the VIP categories alongside other dignitaries, expressed delight with the turnout of athletes, officials and the locals. “The race is a World Athletics elite label event and I’m happy it’s back again,” Shaibu stated. “This is the first race in Africa to be granted a label status by World Athletics, which makes it one of the world-class races across the globe. The target now is to get upgraded to a World Athletics elite platinum label. Edo is a pacesetter and the heartbeat of Nigeria and we are determined to always lead in sports.” President, Athletics Federation of Nigeria, Tonobok Okowa, noted that the race, which did not hold in the last two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, returned even better.
