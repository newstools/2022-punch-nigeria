The Chairman, Kabba/Bunu local government, Kogi State, Moses Olorunleke, has ordered all ‘beer parlours’ in Kabba to close shops by 7:00 pm until further notice. The order followed the explosion that rocked a ‘beer parlour’ Sunday night in the ancient town. 11 people, including the owner of the beer parlour, were injured in the explosion, the second in May. The first explosion recorded in Kabba town was on May 11. It reportedly killed three out of 16 victims. On May 29, another explosion was recorded at a beer parlour. It left 11 persons, including the bar operator, injured. The police were yet to unravel the mystery surrounding the two blasts. The Chairman also ordered that commercial motorcyclists must stop plying the roads from 10:00 pm, starting from May 31. “This is to notify all beer parlours in Kabba that they should henceforth close their bars latest by 7:00 p.m. This directive also goes to commercial motorcyclists who must suspend their activities latest by 10:00 p.m.,” stated the LG chairman. “All should bear in mind that whosoever goes against these directives will face the wrath of the law.” “It is a shocking and dangerous development that calls for drastic measures in the interest of the citizens of our local government area and Kogi,” added, Mr Olorunleke.
