The Lagos State Government is set to embark on a week-long demolition of identified distressed buildings in the state as part of efforts to secure lives and property in the state. This was disclosed in a statement on Monday by the state Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr. Idris Salako, while giving updates on government’s building collapse prevention plans. According to him, structures to be demolished during the exercise are those marked as distressed by the Lagos State Building Control Agency. Noting that the exercise will also be carried out in Ebute-Metta East where an occupied building collapsed a week ago with many others vividly showing signs of distress, the commissioner said the exercise became necessary as the rains are here. He said, “The administration of Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu is committed to ensuring the security of lives and property. “This underlies our resolve to act promptly in addressing the spate of building collapse by removing inhabitable structures before they cause more havoc, especially during the rainy season when such buildings are more prone to collapse.” The commissioner reiterated that residents should maintain vigilance of the environment and report any untoward developments through the ministry or the state governments communication channels, particularly the Lagos State Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development Mobile App that is available for download both on Google Play and IoS.
