A mechanic who was abducted along the Abonema/Degema/Emuoha Road in Rivers State last week has regained his freedom. Gunmen had attacked a private saloon car along the Israel Amat Junction and whisked away the occupant of the vehicle, a mechanic. Speaking to journalists in Port Harcourt, the state capital, the victim, who simply identified himself as Adesina, said he was kidnapped on his way to return the car to one of his clients. Adesina disclosed that he paid a ransom before the miscreants released him. “It was on Friday around 8pm that they released me. They tied my hands and eyes for three days; I didn’t see anything. “I didn’t eat anything; even water I didn’t drink. I paid money; after my people came, they now released me,” he stated. He called on the state government to provide security on the East-West Road. The acting spokesperson for the state police command, Grace Iringe-Koko, confirmed the release of the mechanic, saying he had been reunited with his family. “Yes, I can confirm his release. Though no arrest has been made yet, we are on the trail of the kidnappers,” she stated.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
