THE Academic Staff Union of Research Institutions has suspended its strike, which commenced last October over unresolved issues with the Federal Government. The union disclosed this in a letter to the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, signed by its Secretary-General, Theophilus Ndubuaku. According to the letter, the suspension of the strike takes immediate effect. “The Academic Staff Union of Research Institutions hereby writes to inform you of our decision to suspend, with immediate effect, our ongoing strike,” the letter read in part. The letter further stated that the union reviewed the efforts of the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment and other Federal Government agencies to resolve the issues in dispute and noted the progress made so far. Meanwhile, in a bid to reopen the public universities shut due to strikes by various industrial unions, the Federal Government has resumed talks with the Joint Action Committee of the Senior Staff Associations of Nigerian Universities and Non-Academic Staff Union. The conciliation meeting, which commenced around 2pm on Thursday at the labour ministry, was ongoing as of the time of filing this report.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
