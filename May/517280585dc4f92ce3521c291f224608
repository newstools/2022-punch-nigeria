The Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday said 11 countries on the African continent are currently experiencing the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing journalists during a virtual press briefing, the deputy head of the organisation, Ahmed Ogwell, said, “Countries experiencing their fifth wave of COVID-19 are seeing tallies spike higher than previous waves. “Eleven countries on the continent are currently in their fifth wave of infection, while Mauritius is in its sixth wave. Some of the countries are Algeria, Benin, Congo Republic, Egypt, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mauritius, Somalia and Tunisia. “The saving grace is that the number of deaths over a similar period is lower.” He added that South Africa was responsible for the 38 per cent increase in COVID-19 infection numbers on the continent, while in contrast, deaths fell from 59 per cent during the same period. Across Africa, 11.4 million infections and about 252,000 deaths have been recorded since the start of the pandemic. Following a decline in the number of reported cases by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, the Federal Government announced a relaxation of major COVID-19 restrictions in the country. Experts have described the relaxation as dangerous following a spike in the number of cases reported in China and the looming electoral season.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
