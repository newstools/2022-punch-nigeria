A firm, Napmantronix Limited, has pledged its support to the 20-year tourism master plan unveiled by the Lagos State Ministry of Tourism in 2020. The Chairman of the firm, Mr Napoleon Agbelogode, said this in a statement on Thursday. He was quoted to have spoken at the inauguration of the firm’s event centre and lounge in the Ibeju-Lekki area of the state. Agbelogode noted that the firm’s new initiative would put a footprint firmly on the Lagos State tourism sector. He said, “We intended to use our platform to draw attention to the untapped and unexplored enormous entertainment and tourism potential of this part of Lagos to make a loud statement with our entry into the entertainment segment. “The whole idea is to build on this legacy, also partnering with stakeholders in government, the communities, and the print and electronic media to help tell our story.” The Director of Business Development, Pazino Engineering and Construction Company, Mr Kelechi Igwegbe, applauded Napmantronix for unveiling the centre in the Ibeju Lekki, saying it would give new and old residents of the community a new feeling. “These are the things that we are doing here to carve a niche for ourselves in the Ibeju Lekki axis. Napmantronix has done well in the events and lounging sector. We now bring some of our best clients to come and have a feel of what is happening,” he said.
