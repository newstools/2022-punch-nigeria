At least seven farmers were killed in their farmlands in Faru village, Maradun Local Government Area of Zamfara State in the early hours of Saturday. An indigene of the area, Garba Abdullahi told The PUNCH that the victims were in their farmlands for this year’s farming season when they were attacked and killed by the bandits. Abdullahi stated that one of his relations, Sani Akwala, was among the farmers killed by the bandits. “My elder brother, Sani Akwala was among those who were mercilessly killed by these heartless bandits.” Abdullahi said the bandits had been terrorising the village since the beginning of this year’s rainy-season farming. He said the bandits vowed that no farming activities would take place within the area in this year’s farming season. “The bandits have been going round the farmlands in order to ensure compliance with their directive,” Abdullahi said. He lamented that it would be difficult for the farmers to farm in this year’s farming season, calling on the appropriate authorities to urgently do something. He expressed the fear that unless something was done on time, the people of the village would have no option but to migrate to other places. “We are planning to flee the village due to the growing insecurity challenges because we understand that from all indications, the bandits will not allow us to farm this year.” Efforts to get comments from the spokesperson for Zamfara State Police Command, SP Mohammed Shehu, failed as he could not be reached on phone.
