Nigeria international Alex Iwobi has described the just concluded 2021/22 season as the most challenging of his career, adding he was in a happy mood after helping English Premier League side, Everton, survive the relegation, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. It was a tough season for the Toffees having to fight hard to survive the drop on match-day 27 of the season after beating Crystal Palace 3-2 at the Goodison Park to confirm their safety. With their place in the topflight already guaranteed, Iwobi returned to the Emirates Stadium with Everton in the season’s finale of the Premier League fixture against Arsenal and it was not the best of homecomings for the Nigerian as he suffered a heavy 5-1 defeat. Despite an underwhelming start to the season, Iwobi was able to turn his form around and became one of Everton’s best players towards the end of the season starting all of their last 12 matches. Reacting to the end of the season, the 26-year-old said he was delighted to have seen the season come to an end. “The most mentally challenging season of my career so far is over and I’m proud to have come out of the other side stronger, sharper and hungrier than ever!” Iwobi wrote on Twitter. Iwobi has three goals and three assists in 31 appearances for Everton this season. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
