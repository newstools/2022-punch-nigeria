The National Leader of All Progressive Congress and former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, on Tuesday said he would not retire from politics until he becomes Nigeria’s president. Addressing delegates and party members in Makurdi, Benue State capital, Tinubu said though the future belongs to the youth, and his generation will soon leave the stage, he will only retire after becoming president. He said, “To you, the youths of Benue be determined and get you PVCs, revalidate it, I am with you, Akume is with you, and others (leaders) who are not here are with you to guarantee your posterity, hope, a united and prosperous Nigeria. “We are of age, we can retire soon but I am not going to retire until I become president.” The national leader of APC said that if given the mandate, he would turn around the fortune of the country where corruption would be tackled on all fronts, ensure the peaceful coexistence of Nigerians. “I will govern with all my strength, we will work with you to reverse the trend of corruption, there are elements of division but our commitment to Nigeria is for peaceful coexistence to build up and demonstrate unity and live together in peace and harmony. “Am not strange to you, I have been here for over 30 years, working with several people, at a time I was to be the Senate President but I made a sacrifice for him (Iyorchia Ayu) but he is in another party now,” he said.
