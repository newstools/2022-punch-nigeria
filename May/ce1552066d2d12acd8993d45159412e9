According to Italian newspaper, La Gazzetta Dello, Napoli have set a deadline date of July 8 for clubs interested in Victor Osimhen to come forward with their bids or forget about signing the Nigeria international. Osimhen, who won the Italian Serie A Most Valuable Player for U-23 footballers, has attracted the attention of many clubs and is one of the most sought-after players in Europe after a fine season in Italy. The Nigeria international scored 18 goals and registered six assists for Napoli in all competitions despite missing a chunk of the season with injury. English Premier League clubs Manchester United, Arsenal, and Newcastle are desperate to sign the 23-year-old striker but Napoli’s valuation of €110m has been a stumbling block in the purchase of the Nigerian. However, according to MondoNapoli quoting La Gazzetta Dello, the Partenopeans, who will be competing in the UEFA Champions League next season, want to get the deals for the striker sorted out as soon as possible and have stated that offers beyond the stipulated date would be turned down. “Today’s edition of La Gazzetta Dello Sport focuses on Naples, in particular on its possible market negotiations,” the website wrote. “According to the newspaper, it seems that the blue club has established the deadline by which to receive offers for the sale of Victor Osimhen: July 8, the start of the summer retreat.”  Contact: theeditor@punchng.com Copyright PUNCH.
