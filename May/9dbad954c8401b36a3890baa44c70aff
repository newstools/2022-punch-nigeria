Men of the Nigerian Army have allegedly stormed the scene where students were protesting in Akure, Ondo State on Tuesday. The students had gone out for a second-day protest in the state over the lingering strike action of the Academic Staff Union of Universities. Videos obtained by our correspondent had shown soldiers marching in their numbers with their guns, alongside a van being driven after them. Sporadic gunshots were heard as they moved while some of the students ran in panic. The students of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba, in Akure, had, alongside, counterparts from neighboring states, barricaded major highways, including the Benin-Ore Express road while they protested. Sources told our correspondent that as of yesterday, the police and soldiers came to the protest scene, but today, they had come with violence as they started to disperse the students and disrupt other things. “What happened in Lekki is happening again in Ondo!” One of the protesters had screamed in another video which showed that the instruments of the protests being used by the students had been scattered. “They’re killing us,” another person said. The PUNCH reported that last week, in Ibadan, men of the Nigerian army had also attempted to run over protesting students around the University of Ibadan. This was condemned in a statement by the ASUU, Lagos zone. For over a week, students had protested across Nigeria over the ASUU strike, calling on the Federal Government to accede to the demands of the striking lecturers. The PUNCH reports that the ASUU strike, which began on February 14, has entered 92 days. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
