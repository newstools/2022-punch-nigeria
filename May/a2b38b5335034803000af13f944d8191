A former Minister of Information and Culture under the late Sani Abacha regime, Chief Ikeobasi Mokelu, narrowly beat the deadline for the submission of the All Progressives Congress presidential expression of interest and nomination forms. A statement from Mokelu’s campaign office on Saturday said the forms were submitted at about 9pm on Friday at the APC national headquarters in Abuja. Speaking after submitting the forms, a former South-East APC Zonal Organising Secretary, Timothy Amah, who reportedly led friends, associates, businessmen, artisans, market men, women and students to submit the forms, expressed happiness that they were able to beat the deadline, “considering that the forms were obtained on the last approved date because the money used in purchasing the forms was contributed by all the people who followed him to do the submission.’’ Amah was quoted as stating that Mokelu had the experience and capacity to win the general election for the APC if he got the ticket. “This is not about how deep one’s pocket is but the capacity, character and the understanding of what leadership entails, especially at this period of our nationhood that requires creation of wealth and not to share money. “When you engage him, you will appreciate the fact that Chief Mokelu is a very intelligent man, very matured and experienced.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
