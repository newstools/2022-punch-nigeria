A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress and presidential aspirant, Bola Tinubu, has emphasised the pivotal role farmers play in providing food security for the country. According to a statement by the Tinubu Media Office, this was during his visit to Gombe State where he met with Governor
Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya, APC Chairman in the state, Nitte Amangal, and party delegates on Tuesday. Speaking during the meeting, Tinubu commended farmers for their hard toil and labour under often challenging conditions. This is as he promised to build on the current administration’s progress made in the sector if elected president. Also speaking, Governor Yahaya described Tinubu as a leader with the uncommon talent to identify talents that can aid the development of the country. “Asiwaju is a prominent politician, a politician par excellence, a leader of men and a talent hunter,” he said. On his part, the state APC Chairman pledged the support of the delegates to the presidential hopeful whom he said should consider Gombe a second home. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
