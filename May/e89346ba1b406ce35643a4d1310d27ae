A High Court sitting at the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, on Tuesday, issued a warrant of arrest against a dismissed teacher, Igoche Adah, over his failure to appear to face charges of alleged sexual abuse. Justice Akeem Fashola issued the warrant following the absence of the defendant for the second time to take his plea in the criminal charges brought against him by the FCT Commissioner of Police, Sunday Babaji. When the matter was called, it was discovered that the accused person was not in court and had no legal representation. Counsel for the police, John Ijagbemi, informed the judge that the accused person and his surety were served hearing notices and that they promised to be in court. The lawyer expressed disgust that the accused person chose to disrespect the court for the second time by ignoring the court’s invitation. Ijagbemi subsequently pleaded with Justice Fashola to issue a warrant of arrest against the accused person to enable the police to pick him up and bring him before the court. Delivering a brief ruling, the judge agreed that the defendant was exhibiting disrespect to the court and that such attitude must be curbed. Justice Fashola ordered that he should be detained and brought before the court to show cause why judgment in the criminal charges should not be granted against him. The judge fixed June 23 for the police to bring him before the court. Ijagbemi, in an interview with judiciary correspondents after the proceedings, said he was compelled to make the application because of Adah’s persistent refusal to honour invitations of the court.
