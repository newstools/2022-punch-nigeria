The Chairman of Keffi Local Government Area, in Nasarawa State, Muhammed Shehu, has been reportedly released by his abductors. The police authorities had said that Shehu and his aide regained their freedom in the early hours of Sunday, following the efforts of the combined team of security personnel. The PUNCH had reported on Saturday that Shehu was abducted alongside his driver by the gunmen on Friday night, while his police escort was killed. A source who pleaded anonymity had told our correspondent that the chairman, on Friday night, was travelling with his driver and police orderly but the gunmen mounted roadblocks along the Keffi-Akwanga road and shot sporadically in the air which forced them to stop their vehicle before they were kidnapped. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Rahman Nansel, confirmed the release to newsmen. He noted that Shehu and his aide were released unhurt, adding that the police operatives had arrested three suspects in connection with the incident. It was gathered that the suspects were on their way to collect ransom and were assisting the authorities in the ongoing investigation into the abduction. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
