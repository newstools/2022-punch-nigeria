Abidemi Jeremiah Shittu, and the Bishop of Owerri, Rt. Rev. Dennis Mark, from their abductors. The Command’s Police Public Relations Officer, Geoffrey Ogbonna, confirmed the development on Monday night, adding that though the victims have been released, no arrests have been made. “If there is any (arrest), it is not to my knowledge. All I know is that they have regained their freedom,” Ogbonna said. He also stated that he was not aware if any ransom was paid, adding that “it is when we see them that we can now ask those questions”. His Eminence, Samuel Kanu Uche was kidnapped along Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway, in Umunneochi Local Government Mark, and the Prelate’s Chaplain by unidentified gunmen on Sunday. They were reportedly on their way from a programme in Umunneochi when the incident happened.
