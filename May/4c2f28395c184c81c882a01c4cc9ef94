Former England international of Nigerian descent, John Fashanu, has backed Alex Iwobi to help English Premier League side, Everton, survive relegation, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Iwobi started the season on a poor note and was heavily criticised by the club’s fans for his underwhelming displays. The Nigerian has however been in the best form of his career since April and is one of the reasons the Toffees have revived their hopes of staying in the topflight for at least another season. Iwobi has become a key player and one of Lampard’s most trusted players and has started all of Everton’s last nine matches playing in different positions. His fine assist for Vitalii Mykolenko against Leicester City set the tone for the 2-1 win over the Foxes at the King Power Stadium last weekend to move them to 16th on the league table. With just three games to the end of the season, the former Wimbledon star has backed Iwobi to continue with his impressive form and see to the safety of Everton. “Iwobi is one of the players who have really excelled in recent months and is doing very good,” Fashanu told PUNCH Sports Extra. “For footballers, things can go right or wrong but we are all hoping that he can help Everton stay at the top. “Iwobi has been in fine form lately and has played in different positions. I’m sure he can continue with that form and help Everton stay in the Premier League.” Everton face Brentford in their next league game at home on Sunday. A win will boost their chances of surviving the drop. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
