The Lekki Estates Residents and Stakeholders Association has promised to support the family of an official of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority official, Jamiu Issa, who was recently knocked down and killed by a traffic offender on the Lekki Expressway in Lagos. The Secretary General of LESRA, Mr Gbemi Adelekan, led the delegation on a condolence visit to the family of the deceased, according to a statement on Friday. Adenekan assured Issa’s widow and three children that members of the association would not abandon the family. He stressed that LERSA had resolved to provide the family with financial and material support to cushion the effect of the unfortunate development. “Our thoughts and sympathy are with the entire family at this grieving period. While we pray for his soul to continue to rest in perfect peace, we want to assure the family of our unwavering support at this difficult time. “We shall assist the family with material and financial aid to help get by the sudden death of the head of their family,” Adenekan said.
