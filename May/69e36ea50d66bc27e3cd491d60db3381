Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, was on Wednesday, joined by his Kwara State counterpart, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, at a ceremony organised to kickstart the construction of the 76.67Km Ogbomoso-Fapote-Iseyin Road, where he stated that the project is of economic importance to both Oyo and Kwara States. The project connects Ogbomoso, which is less than 30 minutes from Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, to Iseyin, a city in Oke Ogun zone of Oyo State, which also shares a boundary with Kwara. A statement by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr Taiwo Adisa, quoted AbdulRazaq as saying that the road would impact the economy of Oyo State and also be of benefit to Kwara State. He said travellers from Northern Nigeria, including Kwara, will have an easier access to Oyo and even Ogun states. He commended Makinde for creating huge economic values along the axis, saying that the project, like many other road infrastructure projects undertaken by Governor Makinde, were for posterity. He said,  “I congratulate Your Excellency for this important road project. This road seeks to connect Ogbomoso to Iseyin and that will bring comfort to and reduce travel time for people who want to travel further South to Abeokuta.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
