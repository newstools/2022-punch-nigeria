The General Overseer of Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has described malaria as more deadly than the dreaded COVID-19. He quoted media reports as saying that not less than 200,000 persons reportedly died as a result of Malaria in Nigeria in 2021, adding that despite the disruption caused by COVID-19, the causality figure was less than 2,000. Adeboye said this on Sunday in the opening of his monthly telecast monitored by our correspondent. He said, “I read in the newspaper that 200,000 people died from Malaria in Nigeria last year. “For coronavirus, the casualty figure is less than 2,000. Which one is more deadly? Is it ‘Coro’ or Malaria?” He lamented the increase of persons who took delight in staying away from the church citing coronavirus as an excuse, saying that he had prophesied that it would subside and not go away. “Any young person staying away from church is disobeying God, anyone older than me is old and anyone younger than me is young. I am still young. If you want to wear a facemask, fine. “God told me Coronavirus will subside but it will not go away. Safety is of the lord, stop fearing the devil,” the pastor said.
