The Executive Chairman of Keffi Local Government Area of Nasarawa State, Muhammad Shehu, has been reportedly abducted alongside his driver by yet to be identified gunmen. A source who pleaded anonymity told our correspondent that the chairman, on Friday night, was travelling with his driver and police orderly but the gunmen mounted roadblocks along the Keffi-Akwanga road and shot sporadically in the air which forced them to stop their vehicle before they were kidnapped. The source further said that in a bid to put the situation under control, the police orderly, made efforts to repel the attack but unfortunately lost his life in the process. “We received information that the Executive Chairman was coming from a programme organised by the Keffi Old Boys Association at the Government College, Keffi when his vehicle was attacked. “His police orderly made efforts to handle the situation but he was shot dead by the gunmen before they were able to take the chairman and his driver away,” the source said. Confirming the attack, the Commissioner of Police in the state, CP Adesina Soyemi, said police operatives had taken over the location of the attack in order to rescue the victims and arrest the kidnappers. “Police operatives are now in the area where they were kidnapped. We have taken over the environment and I can assure you that they would soon be rescued and the perpetrators of the act would not escape the wrath of the law,” CP Soyemi said. Copyright PUNCH.
