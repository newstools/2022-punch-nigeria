The Nigerian Army, on Monday, dismissed claims that some Nigerian villages were attacked by the militants of Ambazonia, a separatist group in South-West Cameroon. The Nigerian Army said the militants attacked some communities on Sunday but the attack did not happen on Nigerian territory. According to a statement by the Director, Army Public Relations, Brig-Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, four victims who ran to the Nigerian territory were saved. The statement read, “The Nigerian Army has been notified of a statement insinuating that Nigerian villages were attacked by Cameroonian separatists on 29 May 2022. “Contrary to the misinformation, own troops deployed at Danare received information on Sunday morning about the said attack. The troops immediately mobilised to the Bashu community, which was allegedly under attack. “On their arrival, it was revealed that Bashu was not under attack and no external incursion was recorded; rather the separatists attacked Obonyi 2 and Njasha, both of which are communities located in the Republic of Cameroon. Four victims of the attack, who crossed over to Nigerian territory were later rescued by our troops and operatives of Nigerian Immigration Services. The attack was therefore not within Nigerian territory as claimed.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
