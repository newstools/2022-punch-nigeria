A landlady, Ebun Salaudeen, has accused her tenant, Toyin Opabi, of depriving her of access to her property on Caroline-Odu Street, in the Ejigbo area of Lagos State. Salaudeen, while addressing an Ebute Meta Magistrate’s Court on Monday through an interpreter, said Opabi rented a mini-flat apartment from her, adding that they later started having issues. The landlady said she visited the property for a routine check and discovered that her tenant had packed out and locked the property. She noted that efforts to reach Opabi proved abortive. Salaudeen said she had been having issues with her tenant since 2020, adding that the relationship worsened after the first lockdown induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. She said, “I went for my routine check sometime in February and found a padlock at the door of the house. When I looked through the window, I saw that she (Opabi) had packed out. “All efforts to reach out to her to come and open up the apartment have proved abortive which is why the case was brought to the magistrate’s court in Ebute Meta. I want the court to help me get my apartment back.” The Magistrate, Folarin Williams, adjourned the case till May 16, 2022, for further hearing. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
