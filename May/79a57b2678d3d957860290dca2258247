THE Association of Nigerian Development Finance Institutions says it has concluded plans to leverage its yearly conference to exchange ideas on development finance as part of efforts to explore opportunities in innovative financing for sustainable development. It said in a statement that its second annual general assembly/conference in Abuja this week would serve as an opportunity to discuss the theme, ‘Innovative financing for sustainable growth and development’. The Chairman of the association and Managing Director, Bank of Industry, Olukayode Pitan, stated that the event would also feature a panel discussion on ‘mobilising sustainable development finance’. It stated that the keynote speaker is the Managing Director of Uganda Development Bank Limited, Mrs Patricia Ojangole, while other top executives of the banking and financial institutions including the Central Bank of Nigeria would grace the occasion. Pitan said the conference was expected to bring together stakeholders that are enthusiastic about sharing ideas that would benefit not just the DFIs, but the economy of Nigeria as a whole. He added that ANDFI remained committed to creating a forum for DFIs in Nigeria to discuss and exchange ideas on issues of common interest, and provide a platform for members to cooperate in areas of investment, finance and capacity building.
