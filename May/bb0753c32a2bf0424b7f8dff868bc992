A Christian cleric, identified as Venerable Olu Obanla, has reportedly been kidnapped along Ifon-Okeluse Road in the Ose Local Government Area of Ondo State on Saturday. It was gathered that the victims were travelling along the road when the hoodlums accosted and dragged them into the bush to an unknown destination. A source said shortly after the abduction, the bandits contacted the family and demanded a sum of N10 million for the release of the victims but the family were unable to get the money as they could only gather N1million which was refused by the abductors. The source said, “Venerable Olu Obanla and his son were kidnapped yesterday (Saturday) on their way to Okeluse in Ondo State. “The kidnappers have contacted the family and ransom of N10 million was  being demanded by the kidnappers but the family had raised N1million but the kidnappers rejected it.” When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Funmilayo Odunlami, confirmed the incident and said efforts were ongoing by the detectives of the command to rescue the victims. The PPRO said, “Yes, it happened and the anti-kidnapping section is working to  ensure the victims are released unhurt.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
