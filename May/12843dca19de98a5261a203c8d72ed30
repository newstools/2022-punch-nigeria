Security risk management organisation, Halogen Group, says it has been voted ‘Nigeria’s Most Valuable Contract Security Company.’ A statement by the firm said the recognition was given to Halogen by the UK-based organisers of the annual security performance awards at the just concluded Securex Expo 2022, in Lagos. According to the statement, OSPAs, a globally recognised honour, was an independent award scheme rewarding outstanding performance in the security sector in the UK, the United States of America, Nigeria, Europe, and other parts of the world. The award scheme recognises and rewards companies, people, products, and services that have made significant contributions to the Nigerian security sector and demonstrated exceptional industry talent and innovation in different categories. Halogen’s award, the fifth consecutive win in the series, came after a top jury comprising seasoned private security experts judged the company the nation’s most outstanding in the keenly contested annual exercise. The Group Managing Director, Halogen Group, Mr Wale Olaoye, described the award as a reflection of the company’s unending culture of excellence, and its focused investment in research, innovative technology, and capacity building. Halogen Group, which was incorporated in Nigeria three decades ago as Halogen Security Company Limited, is West Africa’s leading risk advisory and integrated security solutions group.
