The All Progressives Congress has suspended the youth leader and ward chairman in Gwaram Local Government Area, who were said to have allegedly disobeyed the party’s directives. This was made known by the APC Chairman in Gwaram, Ayuba Nasarawa who stated it after a meeting with the party’s executives. The suspended persons were the APC youth leader, Gambo Umar Bango, of Gwaram Local Government Area, and the APC chairman of Dingaya ward, Salisu Garba. It was gathered that the party had set up a committee to investigate the alleged misconduct and violation of the party’s guidelines. Nasarawa said that the executives would remain suspended until the committee gave reports. He added that the party would not tolerate any act of indiscipline and disloyalty to the party leadership. The Jigawa State House of Assembly had also earlier suspended the Chairman, Mubarak Achilafiya, of Yankwashi Local Government Area indefinitely over alleged disloyalty to the state chairman of the party. He was however ordered reinstated after some hours by the governor of the state, Muhammad Abubakar. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
