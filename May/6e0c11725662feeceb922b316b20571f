Rivers Angels captain, Deborah Abiodun, had nothing but criticisms for the level of officiating after the Nigeria Women’s Football League champions drew their second match in the ongoing NWFL Super Six Wednesday in Benin City. In a match that promised so much, the goalless draw at full time sees Angels earn just one point from their first two games at the tournament, after losing their opening clash against Bayelsa Queens 2-1 Tuesday. Angels had two goals disallowed during the match. The first was not awarded after the referee insisted the ball did not cross the goal line, while the second was ruled out for offside. Abiodun appealed to the NWFL leadership as well as the Nigeria Football Federation to look into the game to ensure better officiating during the post-match interview. “I feel so bad, with all due respect, I’ll say I’m disappointed in the officiating of the game, because my team and myself, we came all out, we deserved to win,” she said. “I’ll like the federation to take a look at the clip. We had about two chances, two glaring chances, one was called off as offside, and the other was not recorded, after it had crossed the goal line.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
