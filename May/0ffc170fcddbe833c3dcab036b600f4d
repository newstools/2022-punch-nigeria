Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, would, on Thursday, May 12, pay compensation to victims of police brutality in the state. A Justice Akinwale Oladimeji-led panel had looked into cases of assault, illegal arrests, killings, brutality, and other forms of rights abuse by the officers and men of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the Nigerian Police in the state. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Ismail Omipidan, obtained in Osogbo on Tuesday, said the compensations would be paid based on the recommendations of the #EndSARS panel set up by the governor. Oyetola, according to the statement, then assured that his administration had resolved to rid the state of all forms of injustice against the vulnerable. He also called on citizens to hold external and internal institutions and other citizens accountable in ways that public conducts and behaviours conform to the ethos of ‘Omoluabi’. The statement recalled that Oyetola, in his message to Osun youths during the first anniversary of #EndSARS, promised to pay the compensations as recommended by the panel, even after submitting the report to the Presidency as directed.
