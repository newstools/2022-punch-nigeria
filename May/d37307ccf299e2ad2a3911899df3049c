Senate spokesperson, Ajibola Basiru, has been appointed the Director General of the All Progressives Congress campaign committee for the Osun 2022 governorship poll. Inaugurating the committee at the APC state secretariat in Osogbo on Thursday, the chairman of the party, Gboyega Famoodun, said the campaign council would also have chairmen for all the nine federal constituencies. He also called on the committee members to expose anyone working to sabotage the reelection of the governor, Adegboyega Oyetola. Famoodun said, “There are nine federal constituencies campaign committees headed by different chairmen, answerable to the state campaign committee and the council. “If anyone is not working for the party or sabotaging any committee’s effort, he should be reported to the party secretariat. “And if anyone ought to be part of it, the decision should be communicated to the state campaign committee for necessary action.” In his remarks Basiru said the task before the committee may be difficult, but added that the assignment has been made easy by Oyetola, who he said started the preparation for the election from the first day of assuming office as governor.
