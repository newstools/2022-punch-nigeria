Some assailants, on Monday, invaded the premises of the Anambra Broadcasting Service, Awada, Onitsha. The hoodlums, who could not enter the main building due to the superior firepower of the security men on the ground, reportedly burnt some vehicles parked on the premises. Although no life was lost, the gunmen were said to have brutalised some staff members of the station. The acting Managing Director of the ABS, Mr Gabriel Okpalaeze, said the police were handling the matter. He said, “Yes, we were attacked, but we don’t know the people behind it until security agencies unravel them. Some vehicles were burnt, but we are not in a position to know whether it is a case of arson or not.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, said no life was lost in the incident. Ikenga said the suspected arsonists could not enter the studio, but burnt two operational vehicles belonging to the station. He said, “Following a distress call today, May 30, around 4.30am of a case of arson at the Anambra State Broadcasting Station, Idemili North, a police patrol team responded swiftly. The hoodlums were prevented from causing damage to the structure.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
