An Abeokuta Magistrates’ Court on Thursday remanded a 30-year-old man, Ajibola Akindele, in the Oba Custodial Centre for allegedly raping a 21-year-old woman. The Magistrate, Mrs Olajumoke Somefun, who did not take the defendant’s plea, ordered that the case file be sent to the Directorate of Public Prosecutions for advice. Somefun adjourned the case until July 13 for mention. Earlier, the police prosecutor, ASP Olakunle Shonibare, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on April 16 at The Redeemed Evangelism Ministry at Ita-Oshin, Abeokuta. Shonibare alleged that the defendant, who came to decorate a hall that was contracted out, forcefully had carnal knowledge of the woman on the church premises. “The woman was asked to go and open the door for the defendant to enter the hall,” the prosecutor added. He said the woman reported the case to the police and the defendant was arrested. Shonibare said the offence contravened sections 358 and 359 of the Criminal Law of Ogun State, 2006.
