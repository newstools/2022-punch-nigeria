Nigeria international Zaidu Sanusi was in action on Sunday as Porto won the Taca de Portugal after a 3-1 victory over Tondela at the Estadio Nacional. The left-back played the entire 90 minutes and put on a fine display to claim his second title in Portugal this season, having guided them to the Portuguese league title a fortnight ago. Sanusi scored the dramatic late winner that sealed a 30th Portuguese league title for Porto as they beat Benfica 1-0. The Dragons, as Porto are fondly called, were in for another celebration Sunday, following their win in the final of the Portuguese Cup. Porto were favourites going into the tie, and they showed their dominance from the start. It took them just 22 minutes to get in front through a goal from Mehdi Taremi. The league champions added their second through Vitinha after a brilliant assist from Pepe. Taremi then failed to double his lead after missing from the penalty spot in the 66th minute, before Tondela pulled a goal back in the 72nd minute through Neto Borges. Taremi made up for his penalty miss and restored Porto’s two-goal lead as the giants responded instantly to cement a 3-1 victory. The victory ensured Porto claimed their second Cup title in three years. And for Sanusi, it is his second title of the season after securing the Portugal Liga two weeks ago.  Copyright PUNCH.
