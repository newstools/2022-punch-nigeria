The first Abia female governorship candidate from the Youth Party, Chief Oluchi Ogwo, has emerged with a strong conviction that only a female governor will deliver the state from bad governance. Speaking after she was formally handed over her nomination and expression of interest forms at the state headquarters of the party in Umuahia, on Wednesday, Ogwo said, “the battle has started as I am the first woman to become a party candidate in Abia.” Assuring that “by this time next year, a woman would become the governor of Abia State”, she maintained “The state is still as it was because a woman has not ruled it.” She noted that men had done a bad job in the state and now a chance for a woman to prove her worth. She added, “I will go, I will do it. It is time for men to stand down for a woman like me and should work with me to move the state forward.” “Abia is tired of men. A chance must be given for a woman to rule Abia State. There is a lot I can do for the state and there is no change that will come to Abia without a woman ruling the state”, she said, urging others who couldn’t make it to round their kind to better the state.
