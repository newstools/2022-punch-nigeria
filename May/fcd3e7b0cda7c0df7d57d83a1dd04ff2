Following the security challenges affecting Zamfara State, the state government has suspended the Nigerian Union of Journalists State Council’s 2022 delegates conference scheduled to hold next Thursday. This was contained in a statement signed by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Information, Sani Nasaawa, and made available to newsmen in Gusau, the state capital. The state’s union election had earlier been scheduled to hold on May 14, 2022 but rescheduled to May 12, 2022 by the national headquarters of the NUJ. The statement read, “The readjusted date and time is not favourable due to the security situation of the state and beyond. “The Information Ministry is making consultations with the security agencies in the state for appropriate date and time for the conduct of the election.” The statement was also copied to the National President of the Union, the Zamfara Commissioner of Police, the Director State Security Services, and the Commandant Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps Zamfara State. Reacting to the development, Secretary of the Credentials Screening Committee, Dahiru Mafara, said the committee would notify all relevant stakeholders as directed by the national secretariat of the union on the new development. Recall that 63 people were killed by bandits in Bakura and Maradun Local Government Areas of the state over the weekend. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
