The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, on Sunday, said like Ebola Virus Disease, COVID-19 has subsided but it won’t totally disappear. He spoke at the National Headquarters of the church in the Ebute Metta area of Lagos State while delivering a sermon titled, ‘Supernatural Elevation’. The octogenarian preacher, who said he just came back from a ministration in Europe, observed that residents have shunned the use of face masks. He, therefore, said Christians in Nigeria still absent from physical worship at churches are acting in defiant disobedience to God. He said, “You are disobeying direct instruction from God that says you must not abandon the gathering of the brethren.” Adeboye said his prophecy in 2020 that only those whose time had come would die had come to pass. “Coronavirus will subside but it will not go away. Ebola came but subsided. Coronavirus, some of us don’t even want to hear about it anymore,” he emphasised. He urged believers to resume physical worship but advised them not to be careless and not to shun preventive protocols like wearing of face masks, physical distancing, and high hygiene practices.
