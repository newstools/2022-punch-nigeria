The All Progressives Congress governorship candidate in Ekiti State, Biodun Oyebanji, on Monday, assured residents of the state that they would not regret if they allowed continuity in government in the state for the first time. The Director-General of the Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji Campaign Organisation, Cyril Fasuyi, appealed to the people of the state, particularly the APC members, to join hands and work for the victory of the governorship candidate, Oyebanji, popularly known as BAO, so that he could continue with the developmental strides which the Governor Kayode Fayemi administration had begun. Fasuyi, who on Saturday emerged as the APC senatorial candidate for the Ekiti South District, said the victory came his way in view of his closeness to the grassroot. He said, “I won because I am extremely close to the grassroot. The delegates who voted in the primaries are all grassroot people. But for now, my focus, as the DG of Oyebanji’s campaign, is how to make him emerge as governor in the June 18 election. That is what I am working on now. The campaign boss, who said activities for his senatorial election would begin after the APC candidate’s victory, said, “My appeal to the people is that we should work together to produce Oyebanji. Let this continuity agenda work for the first time in Ekiti. Let this continuity agenda work for him, let us start with Oyebanji. Ekiti State will not regret it.” Copyright PUNCH.
