A two-storey building has reportedly collapsed in the Ago Palace Way area of Lagos State. The building, which collapsed at about 3am on Saturday, is located on Chris Igadi Street, opposite Kilimanjaro, off Ago Palace Way. This is coming five days after a three-storey building collapsed on Ibadan Street, Ebute Metta, killing 10 people in the process. The Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, Dr Femi Oke-Osanyintolu, said the agency responded to the incident at 3am on Saturday. “On arrival, information gathered from the residents revealed that the building gave signs several hours before the building collapsed. “Fortunately, nobody was trapped as all the occupants evacuated the area when the signs began two hours before the collapse. “A headcount of occupants was carried out to ensure no occupant was missing and the remains of the building were cordoned off.” Copyright PUNCH.
