American reality TV star, Kourtney Kardashian, has legally married her drummer boyfriend, Travis Barker. The couple tied the knot at the downtown courthouse in Santa Barbara, California, on Sunday, Daily Mail reported. This comes a few weeks after the couple had a private wedding ceremony in a Las Vegas chapel. TMZ reported that the couple walked into the chapel around 1:30am on April 4, 2022, and presented their marriage licence to the chapel owner who also served as witness. The couple did not allow the venue to take pictures as they employed a personal photographer and security. They exchanged vows with a few of their loved ones and their security present including her maternal grandmother, Mary Jo ‘MJ’ Campbell and Barker’s father, Randy. Neither Kourtney’s famous sisters nor her kids were spotted at the wedding or the celebration after. While this is Kourtney’s first marriage, she has three children with her ex-boyfriend Scott Disick. This will be Barker’s third marriage after his marriage with Melissa Kennedy ended in 2002, lasting less than a year. He also parted ways with ex Shanna Moakler in 2008 after four years of marriage and two children. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
