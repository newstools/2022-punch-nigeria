The Peoples Redemption Party in Adamawa State has said the party would be fielding a governorship candidate to contest the 2023 gubernatorial elections in the state for the first time. State chairman of the PRP in Adamawa, Ya’uba Duhu, disclosed, this in Yola during the declaration of Lieutenant commodore Ibrahim Baba-Inna (retd.), a governorship aspirant under the banner of the party. According to Duhu, the PRP had yet to field any governorship candidate in Adamawa State for the governorship poll. He said, “Baba-Inna is the first in the history of Adamawa that is seeking to contest the governorship. We are happy that a dynamic youth, is declaring to contest gubernatorial elections under the PRP for the first time despite the party having been in existence since the first republic. He has also been the motivation for other youths, seeking participation in the 2023 elections in the state for all elective positions from the grassroots.” Baba-inna described himself as a bridge between the old and the new generation. “Being a bridge between the old and the new, I can bring in a lot for the youths because I have been involved in the ICT space as an entrepreneur and the development sector as a social worker. So I have the edge above other contestants,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
