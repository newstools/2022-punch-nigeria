The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency has urged residents to desist from sharing unverified information. This is as the agency described as false the report (not The PUNCH) of a fire incident at Balogun Market, in the Lagos Island area of the state on Monday. A video and some pictures had circulated on the social media depicting traders in panic mode while trying to save their goods and also put out the fire at a market. Reacting, LASEMA, in a statement, said the pictures were from a previous incident and not something that happened on Monday. Publicity Secretary, LASEMA, Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, made this known in a statement titled, ‘False alarm: Fire outbreak at Balogun Market, Lagos Island.’ The statement read in part, “The attention of the agency has been drawn to various messages circulating across social media alleging the above incident is ongoing. “First responders have combed the above-mentioned area and found no evidence of any fire outbreak presently. “Furthermore, the agency can confirm that the pictures being circulated are of a previous incident. “We urge the good people of Lagos State to desist from sharing unverified information as this is a waste of resources and a diversion of effort and rescue personnel from genuine emergencies.”  Copyright PUNCH.
