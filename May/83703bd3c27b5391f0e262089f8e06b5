The deputy governor of Sokoto State and one of the governorship aspirants, Muhammad Dan’Iya, has stepped down from the contest. The chairman of the electoral committee, in his remarks shortly before the commencement of the primary on Wednesday, disclosed that the deputy governor, alongside the chairman of the party in the state, stepped down. Others, according to the chairman, included the former deputy governor of the state, Barrister Mukhtari Shagari, as well as the son of the former governor of the state, Sagir Bafarawa. The sudden withdrawal, however, had left only the immediate past Secretary to the State Governor, Sa’idu Ubamdoma, as the sole gubernatorial aspirant for the Peoples Democratic Party in Sokoto. Meanwhile, the former deputy governor of the state, Mukhtari Shagari, has quit the Peoples Democratic Party. Shagari, who is also a former Minister of Water Resources, announced this on his social media handle. He, however, said he would make his decision on his next political move known to the general public in due course. The election was still ongoing as of the time of filing this report.
