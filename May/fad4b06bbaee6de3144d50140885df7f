A fertilizer company, OCP Africa, is partnering Syngenta Foundation with a view to achieving sustainable agriculture. OCP Africa plans to groom growers and agro entrepreneurs to deploy greenhouse technologies to boost food security, exports and economic growth. According to a statement by OCP Africa, the initiative was pertinent due to the growing population which had fuelled demand for higher quality products, food safety, stable supply and sustainable production. The Head, Business Development and Digital Projects, OCP Africa, Akin Akinwande, noted that to address these challenges, institutions must join forces to develop a modern greenhouse vegetable production sector. Speaking during a Horticulture Training of Trainers( ToT) Master Class held in Abuja for greenhouse managers, field agents and lead farmers,  Akinwande said consistency and quality of supply were becoming vitally important. He reiterated that much still needed to be done to improve the quality of the cultivation as demand for fresh produce increased. He said modern greenhouse vegetable production could provide an innovative solution to meet the fast-growing demand for high quality, safe and sustainable produced vegetables, which were available all-year round.
