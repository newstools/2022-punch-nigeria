There was outrage in the sleepy community of Ikot Andem, in the Ukanafun Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, after a youth leader, Mr Ufot Job, was killed by hoodlums on Monday. PUNCH Metro gathered that his motorcycle, which was given to him as an empowerment tool by a member of the state House of Assembly, was also taken away by the hoodlums. Our correspondent learnt that the assailants ambushed the deceased on a path linking Ekparakwa Road and Ikot Udo Ossiom village. A resident, Akaniyene Inyang, said, “The late Job was riding on his motorcycle from his village, Ikot Andem, when he was ambushed by suspected cultists, who opened fire on him and fled with his motorcycle, leaving him in a pool of blood. “It was too late for him to be saved because when neighbours arrived at the scene following the alarm raised by witnesses, he had lost a lot of blood from the gunshot wounds.” A youth leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the incident had been reported to the police. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Odiko Macdon, when contacted on the phone, said he was attending a workshop. He requested that a text message be sent to his phone. Macdon, however, did not respond to our correspondent’s text message and did not pick up subsequent calls made to his phone as of the time of filing this report.  Copyright PUNCH.
