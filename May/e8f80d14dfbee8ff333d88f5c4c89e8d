THE Edo State Primary Health Care Development Agency has rescheduled the second round of oral polio vaccination for children between ages 0-59 months. By this new development, the exercise earlier slated for May 7 would now hold between May 14 and May 17, 2022. A statement from the Health Education Officer of the ESPHCDA, Mrs Irene Uabor, made available to the News Agency of Nigeria in Benin on Wednesday, confirmed the postponement. It said, “This is to inform the general public that the second round of oral polio vaccination for children between the age group of 0-59 months, that is, less than five years of age, earlier scheduled for May 7, will now hold between May 14 and May 17.” The health official noted that the exercise would be conducted in all the 18 Local Government Areas of the State. She said health personnel in the state would be positioned  at designated points such as churches, mosques and markets to administer the oral polio vaccines. She also noted that the rising cases of polio virus across the state had necessitated the vaccination campaign. The health official, therefore, sensitised parents and guardians to the development, urging them to comply with the prescribed health guidelines that would be issued by the health personnel to carry out the immunisation exercise.
