Super Eagles duo Cyriel Dessers and Alex Iwobi have taken to social media to react to Nigeria’s 2-1 loss to Mexico in an international friendly game at the iconic AT&T Stadium in Dallas on Sunday, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Santiago Gimenez opened the scoring in the 12th minute for the South Americans before in-form Dessers, who made his return to the national team since 2020, headed past Mexican goalkeeper Rodolfo Cota in the 54th minute to put both sides on level terms. While in search of a winner, the three-time African champions conceded an own goal in the 56th minute, as captain William Troost-Ekong put the ball into his own net as he attempted to clear the ball from a fine cross into the box. Despite the defeat, elated Dessers took to Twitter to celebrate his first goal for the Eagles while Iwobi remained positive looking ahead to their clash against Ecuador. “Mexico v Nigeria, couldn’t be more proud to score my 1st international goal,” the Feyenoord striker wrote. Iwobi added, “A lot of positives to take after today’s friendly… We Go Again!” The Eagles will on Thursday face Ecuador at the Red Bull Arena in Harrison in their international friendly.
