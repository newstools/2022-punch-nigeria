The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria has sought the support and intervention of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in curbing oil theft and pipeline vandalism in the Niger Delta. This request was made on Monday, May 16, 2022 in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, by the Chairman of IPMAN, Hon. Bello Binna, who paid a courtesy visit to the Port Harcourt’s Zonal Commander of the anti-graft agency, ACE Nwanneka Nwokike. During the meeting, Binna said the petroleum marketers trusted the EFCC to help proffer solutions to oil theft. He said, “We seek the support and intervention of the EFCC, because the Commission is the only agency trusted to give solutions on issues of pipeline vandalism and oil theft in the Niger Delta region. Responding to IPMAN’s request, Nwokike said the EFCC was working towards ending the menace of oil bunkering. He said, “The EFCC is working tirelessly to put an end to the menace of illegal oil bunkering in the Niger Delta region. I assure you that the EFCC has the desire to reduce, if not bring to an end, the menace of illegal oil bunkering.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
