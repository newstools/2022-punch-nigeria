The All Progressives Congress for the umpteenth time has revised the timetable and schedule of activities for the governorship, State House of Assembly, Senate, and House of Representatives primary elections. The development came a day after the National Working Committee postponed the screening of the presidential aspirants. The revised timetable was announced by the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Felix Morka, on Monday night on Wednesday at the APC Secretariat in Abuja. Morka stated that the recently cleared 145 governorship and State House of Assembly aspirants would test their popularity at the primaries that would be determined by state and local government delegates respectively on Thursday, May 26. On Friday, May 27, the 340 senatorial aspirants who recently got a clean bill of health at the party screening would undergo another litmus test to win the votes of their local government delegates. The last primary, which involved the House of Representatives aspirants would be determined by local government delegates on Saturday, May 28. On the special convention for the Presidential Primary, Morka disclosed that “It will be held as scheduled on Sunday, May 29 – Monday,  May 30, 2022.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
