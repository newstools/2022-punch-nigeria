The National Universities Commission has given full accreditation to four courses run by Trinity University, Yaba, Lagos. A statement by the institution said in a letter addressed to the Vice-Chancellor, Trinity University, Prof. Charles  Ayo, NUC listed the accredited four programmes including B. Sc. Microbiology; B. Sc. Computer Science; and B. Sc. Information Technology in the Faculty of Basic, Medical and Applied Sciences. It added that the NUC also accredited Mass Communication in the Faculty of Arts, Management, and Social Sciences. “Full accreditation was given to the four courses by the NUC following the accreditation exercise that was carried out in December 2021 by a team of academics and professors from various universities across the country. They were sent by NUC to assess the quality of teaching, research, and work going on in the institution,” it read. While commenting on the success of the accreditation,  Ayo, said, “The fact that we got this done is a validation of the good work that we are doing as an institution. It is not an easy task for a university that is barely three years old to record such a feat.” Meanwhile, the statement added that the president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria, Mrs. Comfort Eyitayo, pledged the support of the Institute to Trinity University.
