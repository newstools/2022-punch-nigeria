Senator representing Imo West and All Progressives Congress presidential aspirant, Rochas Okorocha, has asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to respect the rule of law and withdraw all charges against him. The EFCC had on Tuesday broke into his room to arrest him after several hours of laying siege to his residence in Abuja. The anti-graft agency, justifying its action, explained that it arrested Okorocha because the former Imo State governor jumped the administrative bail granted to him. But the lawmaker said the EFCC should respect the December 6, 2021 judgment of Justice Dalyop Pam in Port Harcourt, restraining the commission from investigating and arresting him. Speaking through his lead counsel, Steve Asimobi of Olanipekun & Co law firm, at a press briefing on Friday in Abuja, Okorocha said though the agency made attempt to reverse the judgment, it failed, stressing that the EFCC should comply with the court order. “The judgment has restrained them from investigating and arresting him. The court has restrained EFCC from even instituting actions in court against him, preferring any charges against him and now they have one coming up on Monday with 17 counts. “To our surprise, instead of going on appeal against the judgment by Justice Dalong, they went back to Justice Stephen Dalong, asking him to reverse himself and all the orders he had given. “I am glad to tell you that this afternoon,  that the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt refused to reverse itself.” The counsel said with the latest ruling, Okoro’s arraignment scheduled for Monday had already failed.
