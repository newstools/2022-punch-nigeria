A former Big Brother Naija (Shine Ya Eye) housemate, Nini Singh, simply known as Nini, has advised women in toxic relationships to leave. In an interview with Saturday Beats, she said, “A lot of people, irrespective of gender and age, are in toxic relationships and find it difficult leaving. I think they stay in such situations due to the thought of starting afresh and meeting someone new. However, my advice to them is that, there is always (a) better (option) than toxicity. Life has got amazing things waiting for you at the other side. You just have to leave. Nothing good has ever come out of toxic relationships.” Nini also stated that she saw nothing wrong in married people participating in Big Brother Naija. She said, “I think there is no big deal in it. Married people are people too.” The graduate of Economics from the University of Abuja also stated that she never saw the gift of N1.5m cash gift by her fans coming. She said, “I never saw it coming. It is still so surreal to me that there are people who love me to the point of gathering such a huge amount (of money) for me. I wish I could see every one of them and tell them how amazing and loved that makes me feel, and how much I love every single one of them”. Asked about the qualities she desires in a man, Nini said, “I never really think so much about the kind of man I want. I am more into the connection and friendship we are able to create. I have come to realise that setting bars can be unrealistic most times.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
