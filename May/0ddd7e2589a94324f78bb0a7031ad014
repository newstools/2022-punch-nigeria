The Lagos State Police Command has arrested a 28-year-old traffic robber, Emeka Igwe, also known as Odogwu. The police spokesman in the state, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, who confirmed the arrest on Saturday, said three pistols were recovered from Igwe. Hundeyin said the suspect and his accomplices, who were members of the `Aro-Baga’ cult group, robbed Lagos residents of their valuables in traffic congestions. “Following relentless follow-up investigation, Igwe, the leader of the gang, previously at large, has been arrested,’’ the News Agency of Nigeria quoted him as saying. Hundeyin had issued a statement on April 7 indicating that Igwe escaped while three of his accomplices were arrested. He had stated that Igwe’s accomplices were arrested following a tip-off from Lagosians to officers on routine patrol in Ladipo and Oshodi areas. He, however, tweeted on Saturday that Igwe, the fleeing gang leader, was eventually nabbed and three locally-made pistols recovered from him. Hundeyin added that the Commissioner of Police, Mr Abiodun Alabi, had directed that the suspect and exhibits be transferred to a special squad for further investigation and prosecution.
