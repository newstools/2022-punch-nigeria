The Emir of Zazzau, Mallam Ahmed Nuhu Bamalli, has suspended four district heads for allegedly using local thugs shortly after the traditional Eid-el- Fitr celebration in the ancient city of Zaria, Kaduna State. A statement from the Zauzzau Emirate Council and signed by its Media and Publicity Officer, Abdullahi Aliyu Kwarbai, in Kaduna on Tuesday, said the suspended district head violated the article three emirate rules and regulations governing durbar horse riding. The suspension of the district heads, the statement said, was with immediate effect, adding that the monarchs violated the rules despite repeated warnings. Among the suspended district heads are the Uban Garin Zazzau and District Head of Soba, Alhaji Bashir Shehu Idris, and the Sarkin Dajin Zazzau and District Head of Kubau, Alhaji Shehu Umar Aliyu. Others include; the Wakilin Birnin Zazzau, Alhaji Suleiman Ibrahim Dabo, a member of the Kaduna State House of Assembly, representing Zaria constituency, as well as the Garkuwan Kudun Zazzau, Alhaji Muhammad Sani Uwais, who is also the Bursar, Federal College of Education, Zaria. “The rule directs all title-holders against the use of local thugs, known as ‘Yan tauri’, brandishing local weapons during any occasion. “And the four district heads have violated this rule during the traditional Sallah durbar, despite a series of warnings.” Copyright PUNCH.
