SEPLAT Energy Plc has approved a final dividend of $0.10 per share to shareholders. This was disclosed at the company’s 9th Annual General Meeting held in Lagos. The financial year report showed an increase in profit before tax of 197.8 per cent to N34.7billion, from N10.6billion year-on-year. The company also generated cash from its operations to the tune of N74.4 billion, from N1.7billion year-on-year, rising by 197.8 per cent. It also grew its revenue by 58.6 per cent to N100.6 billion, from N57.9 billion year-on-year, as its gross profit soared to N48.8 billion from N20.1 billion year-on-year, rising by 122.3 per cent. Speaking to the shareholders, former Chairman of SEPLAT Energy, Dr. Bryan (ABC) Orjiako, said the company’s operational and financial performance in 2021 reflected the challenges of the business in Nigeria. “Our average working interest production was 47,693 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) including 29,091 boepd of liquids and 107.9 MMscfd of gas (18,602 boepd).” According to him, SEPLAT’s robust operational performance, despite the operational challenges, meant that SEPLAT was able to meet its dividend commitment, “and with the Board having approved a Q4 dividend of $0.025 per share, we once again returned $0.10 per share to our shareholders for the 2021.” He pointed out that since it raised $535million at its initial public offering in May 2014, the company had returned over $400million to shareholders in the form of dividends. “The performance of our oil business was impacted by two lengthy shut-ins at one of the third-party operated export routes that we rely upon. This underscores the need for alternative export routes to mitigate this risk. “We drilled five oil wells and three gas wells during the year. The oil wells have a combined gross potential of 17.5 kbopd and the gas wells have a combined gross rate of 130 MMscfd of gas and 5.2 kbopd of condensate. I am particularly proud of our strong safety record which saw us reach 24million hours without any Lost Time Injury (LTI) from our operating assets in 2021,” he said.  Copyright PUNCH.
