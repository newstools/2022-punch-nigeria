He noted that the song, titled Stand Strong, talks about the other part of his world “where everyday is a battle.” Davido wrote, “This one is special to me. It’s different. The conception has been different. The mindset has been different. The making has been different. “I know you love it when I make you dance, but now I want to make you feel. This one’s for everyone out there holding it up. “I know what I’ve experienced the past 10 years, and a lot of you have been through it all with me. But… have you really? “For the first time, I want to bring you into the other part of my world. The part where every day is a battle but I have no option but to STAND STRONG. I present to you, the first single off my next album.” He shared a snippet of the song which featured American band, The Samples. Watch video below:  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
