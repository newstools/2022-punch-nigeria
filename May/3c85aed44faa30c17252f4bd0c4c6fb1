After waiting for over nine hours, the Imo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, on Wednesday, postponed its House of Representatives and state House of Assembly primaries. This came after an earlier date for the primaries was postponed due to the internal crisis between the Secretary of the party, Samuel Anyanwu, and a former governor of the state, Emeka Ihedioha. On Wednesday, thousands of party faithful who gathered at the Kanu Nwankwo Stadium in Owerri, waited for hours only to be informed that the election won’t hold. The development made the party faithful to protest. The immediate past national officer of the party that represented the state at the National Working Committee, Henry Ekpe, told journalists that the exercise was postponed because of insecurity. Ekpe said that the primaries would not take place on Thursday at the same venue. He said, “The exercise will no longer take place today. It will take place tomorrow (Thursday). It is not going to be difficult tomorrow because the accreditations had been done already. Today’s postponement is because of inadequate security.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
