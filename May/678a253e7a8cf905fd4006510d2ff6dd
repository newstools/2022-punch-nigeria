A political activist and former member of the House of Representatives, Dr Usman Bugaje, on Friday picked holes in the leadership recruitment process in political parties which, he said, had put Nigeria on a dangerous trajectory. According to him, Nigeria had been going through unprecedented adversity, misery and frustration, which have literally exasperated life and put citizens on the edge. He said Nigeria had not been working but still remained one of the most dangerous places in the world. Bugaje, a critic of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (etd.), stated these in Abuja after picking forms to contest the 2023 presidency on the platform of the Peoples Redemption Party. He said, “Simply put Nigeria is not working, but worse still it has become one of the most dangerous places on the globe. Meanwhile its peers are all well ahead catching up with the first world. This is clearly the culmination of the two decades of bad governance.” Bugaje, former Special Adviser to ex-Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, said the PRP was built on the premise to uplift the poor and downtrodden.
