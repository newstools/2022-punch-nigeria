A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, Bode George, on Saturday, said the party decided to shun the zoning agreement for its presidency ticket for peace and unity of the party. The elder statesman disclosed this in an interview with journalists at the venue of the PDP special convention in Abuja. The PUNCH reports that despite the clamour and agitation for the 2023 presidency to be zoned to the south, the PDP had thrown the ticket open. “I want to state that the party has never been in this situation and that is why I said it is an experimentation and there was a caveat because everybody thought that the zoning and rotation principle has been removed from the constitution, no. “We said for the unity and peace of the party, let everybody go and try their luck. That’s why we are in this situation. I don’t pray that it will be a matter of North and South, because that will be divisive.” So far, following the withdrawal of a former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi and businessman, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, the following will be contesting the presidential ticket under the PDP. They are former Vice President, Abubakar Atiku; two former Senate Presidents, Bukola Saraki and Anyim Pius Anyim; Governors Aminu Tambuwal (Sokoto); Nyesom Wike (Rivers); Bala Mohammed (Bauchi); Emmanuel Udom (Akwa Ibom); former governor of Ekiti State, Ayo Fayose; Sam Ohunabunwa, and Dele Momodu.
