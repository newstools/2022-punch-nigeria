Embattled Peoples Democratic Party governorship aspirant in Rivers State, Farah Dagogo, on Monday took a not guilty plea after he was arraigned before a High Court in Port Harcourt. Dagogo had pleaded not guilty to the two-count charges of cultism and conspiracy. But the court presided over by Justice Chiwendu Nworgu, remanded Dagogo, a federal lawmaker, to the Port Harcourt Correctional Centre after listening to arguments from the defence and prosecution teams. That was the second time Dagogo, who represents the Degema-Bonny Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, has been remanded in the correctional centre. Justice Nworgu, however, ordered that Dagogo be taken back to the Rivers State University Teaching Hospital to continue his treatment. He adjourned to May 20, 2022, to rule on the motion and counter-motion moved by the legal teams involved in the matter. Speaking to our correspondent, one of Dagogo’s lawyers, Babafemi Adegbite, expressed delight that his client took a plea during the arraignment. “Today, his plea was finally taken. But there are some legal issues that arose, which the court will rule on by Friday. We hope to take his bail application by Friday,” Adegbite stated. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
