Nantes winger Moses Simon has been beaten to the RFI Marc Vivien-Foe Award for the Best African Player in Ligue 1 by Ivory Coast and RC Lens captain, Seko Fofana, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The winger failed in his quest to become the third Nigerian to win the award after Vincent Enyeama and Victor Osimhen won the it in 2014 and 2020 respectively. Simon had an impressive 2021/22 season for the The Canaries, claiming the first major silverware of his career with Nantes’ in their 1-0 triumph over Nice at Stade de France, to end the club’s 22-year wait for the prestigious Coupe de France. It was one of the Nigerian’s best seasons, where he had a hand in 14 league goals (six goals and eight assists) – three more than his previous career best. Despite his outstanding campaign, FRANCE 24 and radio station RFI awarded the 2022 Marc-Vivien Foé Prize to Fofana. The Ivorian helped Lens to a seventh-place finish, two seasons after they came from the second division, and scored eight goals in 35 games this season. The 27-year-old beat a group of other African top performers in the league, including Gael Kakuta, Wahbi Khazri, Achraf Hakimi and others. Fofana was chosen from a group of 12 players voted for by 100 sports journalists whose beats are African and French football. No African country has won the award more than Ivoirians (four) and Moroccans (three) in over a decade. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
