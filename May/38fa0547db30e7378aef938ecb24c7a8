The Chairman of Osun State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress, Gboyega Famodun, has condemned the attack on members of the Correspondents’ Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists by some suspected political thugs on Monday. Famodun, in a statement on Tuesday, commiserated with the journalists and some members who were attacked when the party’s governorship campaign train visited Gbongan, Aiyedaade Local Government. The chairman described the attack as “wicked, uncivilised, crude, callous, shocking, inhuman and against the tenets of democracy.” “I cannot fathom the reason for the attack,” he said, adding that the nefarious act was carried out by some elements who were afraid of defeat in the forthcoming election. “I commiserate with the chapel over the attack of four of their members by suspected political thugs shortly after the governor and his entourage left the campaign venue at Gbongan on Monday,” he said. Famodun stated that no amount of provocation, through physical and verbal attacks, would prevent the Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, from coasting to victory in his re-election bid on July 16, 2022. The News Agency of Nigeria learnt that the Chapel’s bus, with journalists on it, was attacked by suspected political thugs while leaving the venue of the governorship campaign in Gbongan. The attackers, who were armed with cutlasses, cudgels, axes, stones and other weapons, also attacked the APC members’ vehicles, leaving many injured. The injured newsmen were, however, taken to a private hospital at the Ogo-Oluwa Area of Osogbo for treatment after they returned to the state capital. NAN
