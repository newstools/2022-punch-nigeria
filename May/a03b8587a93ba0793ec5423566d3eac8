The Independent National Electoral Commission, is making progress in its efforts to stamp out rigging, the Resident Electoral Commissioner in Osun, Prof. Abdulganiy Raji, has said. Prof Raji spoke on Wednesday in Osogbo at a Pre-election Survey Methodology Workshop organised for field agents by The Electoral Institute towards the Osun 2022 governorship election. He, however, said in spite of the previous achievements, the Commission still has a whole lot to deal with to ensure that electoral processes were free of malpractices. He then urged participants at the workshop to engage in critical discussion which would bring about policies and strategies to curb the menace. He said, “It is my pleasure to remind you that the Commission has made tremendous progress in drastic reduction of some election and electoral malpractices such as rigging, overstuffing of ballot boxes, over bloating ballot register, special treatment of voters and election officials, distortion or doctoring of results, disappearance or destruction of ballot box and so on. “All these are things of the past as a result of research, in-depth discussions and innovations that emanated from this kind of events as organized by the Commission at various levels.” Copyright PUNCH.
