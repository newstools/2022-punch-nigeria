Former Brazil and Barcelona defender Juliano Belletti has assessed the possibility of African teams mounting a serious challenge at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Belletti is in Kenya accompanying the Fifa World Cup trophy and believes the continent has the potential to be global competitors but adds that this will take time. “To be honest, it’s not an easy thing, but Africa has potential,” Belletti told Standard Sports. “One day it will be possible. “I think the African teams can be something different in the next World Cup and the others because they are getting better after every competition. “That’s the reason I’m here with the trophy to tell Kenya and the rest of the continent that there is hope in this game.” Morocco, Tunisia, Cameroon, Senegal, and Ghana carry Africa’s hopes and dreams in the next World Cup finals at the end of the year.
