Oil magnate, Tein Jack-Rich, on Friday, declared his intention to run for President on the platform of the All Progressives Congress. This came moments after Jack-Rich submitted his N100m Presidential forms to the APC. He also appointed a former Governor of Bauchi State, Isa Yuguda, as the chairman of his campaign organisation. At 47, Jack-Rich is one of the youngest aspirants in the APC after Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello and Nicholas Felix. The aspirant, while addressing supporters in Abuja, narrated his life story of how he lived as a street boy in Port Harcourt after losing both parents at a tender age. He later founded Belemaoil Producing Limited, the first indigenous oil Exploration and Production Company in Nigeria to emerge from an oil-producing community in the heart of Niger Delta. The father of two noted that he studied Petroleum Production Technology in Panola College Cartage, United States; Business Administration at the University of Wales, and Business Management at Usam University, with several Fellowship and doctorate awards within and outside Nigeria. He said he hopes to focus on youth and women empowerment, infrastructure and job creation if elected as President of Nigeria. “The global economy is about $83tn and the continent of Africa is just three per cent of the global value chain.. That’s about $2.5tn…it is struggling with the economy of California which has a GDP of $3.6tn. “California is about the size of Lagos and Ogun states in South-West Nigeria and Nigeria is just 19.8 per cent of Africa’s GDP. That is worrisome,” he said. Jack-Rich said Nigeria has a lot to do and needs the right leadership to pull Africa out of poverty. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
