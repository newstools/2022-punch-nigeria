Some gunmen have shot two young men, including a barber, along Laboard Road by Commercial Avenue, Sapele Local Government Area of Delta State. Sunday PUNCH gathered that the incident occurred on Friday as the rampaging gunmen suddenly opened fire on the victims. Consequently, the ensuing pandemonium left passersby in the neighbourhood running for safety.  It was, however, gathered that one of the victims died from bullet wounds sustained from the shooting in the early hours of Saturday. He was said to have been administered with six pints of blood to restore the haemorrhage suffered as a result of the gunshot injuries. Details of the incident were sketchy as of the time of filing this report as our correspondent could not ascertain if the incident was a cult-related attack or not. Contacted, the state police spokesperson, Bright Edafe, said no death was recorded in the incident. He stated, “He didn’t die; he was shot in the leg. The police took him to the hospital and he’s responding to treatment.’’ Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
