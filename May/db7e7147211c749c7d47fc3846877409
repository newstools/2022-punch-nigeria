Some Gombe residents on Sunday said Nigeria required a leader like Hamza Al-Mustapha to end myriads of challenges the country is faced with. Al-Mustapha was the Chief Security Officer to the late General Sani Abacha. Speaking on behalf of the group, Nasiru Maigoro said issues would be tackled with discipline, confidence, integrity, humility, creativity, honesty and love if  Al-Mustapha becomes president. Maigoro made this disclosure at a meeting organised by Ibrahim Emir; National Chairman  Hamza Almustapha Media Awareness Halma 2023, where the group urged Al-Mustapha to pick the nomination form. He said, “Currently we are faced with some difficult challenges as a nation which calls for prompt, drastic and strategic measures to overcome them. Hardly will you wake up with the news headlines of killings, kidnappings or bombings in our country. Our highways are no longer safe. The safety of our children schooling almost everywhere is in jeopardy coupled with persistent industrial unrest by the Academic Staff Union, prices of commodities are in the exponential hike.” While urging Al-Mustapha to try his shot to Aso Rock as president, Maigoro added, “Thus; we must as a matter of priority bring someone whom we are confident that he possesses the required qualities of a good leader that is discipline, confidence, empathy, honesty, love for his people, culture and heritage and above all the fear of his creator. “We found that Major Hamza Al-Mustapha has possessed them, hence we seem it necessary to call him, appeal to him to pick a nomination form in a party that would allow him to be its flag bearer to contest for the seat of the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria come 2023.” Copyright PUNCH.
