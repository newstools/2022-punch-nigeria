Premier League clash at Goodison Park, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Iwobi played a crucial role as the Toffees defeated the UEFA Champions League holders 1-0 to boost their hopes of avoiding relegation this season. The Super Eagles midfielder was heavily criticised by the club’s fans for his underwhelming displays in the past and often blamed for some of Everton’s defeats. However, the 25-year-old has rediscovered his form since Frank Lampard took charge of the team following the sacking of Rafa Benitez. Under the Chelsea legend, Iwobi has become a key player and one of Lampard’s most trusted players and has started all of Everton’s last seven matches playing in different positions. Against The Blues on Sunday, Iwobi played at right-back and he was excellent with his performance, drawing praises from fans. Kyle Jones, who has often been a critic of the Nigerian, was quick to praise him for his fantastic display. “Credit where credits due lad, happy to admit I was wrong,” he wrote on Twitter. “You’ve been immense recently and a great shift from you and the lads today…. Now keep it going for 5 more games.” Scott Bayley added, “In fairness mate, I’ve been a critic of you in the past but in the last two months you’ve been excellent. Today (Sunday), you were superb again. Well done mate.” “Well done Alex lad that’s all we ask of our player. Pride, passion and fight, you guy’s did it to a man today. Let’s keep going now,” Alan Wynne wrote on Twitter. A Toffee fan with the username craigwalsh28 apologised to Iwobi for past remarks about the utility player. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
