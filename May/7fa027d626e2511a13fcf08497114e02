A policeman who identified with a cult group in a viral video has been arrested. According to a statement by Force Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, the cop whose name the police withheld, was attached to the Ebonyi State Police Command when he was apprehended. Adejobi’s statement was titled, ‘Cultic activity: IGP condemns act, as officer in viral video identified, arrested’. The statement read, “The Inspector-General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, has condemned the unruly conduct of the Police officer caught in a viral video, singing, dancing, and brandishing a rifle in praise of a particular confraternity (cult). “The officer has been identified as Corporal Matthew Isaac, attached to the Ebonyi State Police Command. “The act of the officer in question, which is clearly calculated to portray the NPF negatively, is a discreditable conduct in line with the provisions of the First Schedule to Regulation 370 of the Police Regulations. “His actions equally violated the provisions of the NPF Social Media Policy (SMP), penal laws, and other extant laws regulating the conduct and discipline of all Police officers.” The FPRO added that the IGP has directed the Commissioner of Police in charge of Ebonyi State to detail the Command’s officer in charge of provost to “hand over the erring officer to the Force Provost Marshall for necessary disciplinary actions”. “The IGP further warned officers to ensure total compliance with the laws guiding the Force as any breach would be severely sanctioned,” the statement concluded.
