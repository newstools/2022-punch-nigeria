Accreditation of the National delegates for the presidential primary election of the  Peoples Democratic Party is underway. The presidential primary is being held at the MKO Abiola International Stadium, Abuja.  The PUNCH reports that no fewer than 811 of delegates from the 774 local government areas across the country would decide the fate of the aspirants jostling to be the flagbearer of the party. Our correspondent observed that the accreditation is being done by geopolitical zones. Our correspondent also observed that a book containing the names and the local government areas of delegates are with party officials at the accreditation centre. The officials in turn cross-check and give  tags carrying the the names of the delegates.  Some of the tags sighted by our correspondent also had barcodes. Also, our correspondent noticed heavy presence of security agents at the venue of the accreditation. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
