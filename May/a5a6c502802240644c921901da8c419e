Governor Udom Gabriel Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State and presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party has asked the Federal Government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities to end the ongoing strike action and reopen universities in the country. He made the call in a statement by the spokesperson for his Presidential Council, Mr Bola Bolawole. Emmanuel stated that it was time for the FG and ASUU to take action and end the strike,  saying failure to quickly do so could be calamitous for generations of Nigerian youths, their parents, and the nation. “Enough is now enough! All the key players or gladiators should understand that what is going on is self-immolation. We all must stop cutting our noses to spite our faces. Saving the university system from imminent collapse is a task that must be done. It is the duty of every one of us; not the government alone; and not ASUU alone. Everyone must stand up to be counted. “I have added my voice! Add yours! Heeding this clarion call is the first step in the right direction.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
