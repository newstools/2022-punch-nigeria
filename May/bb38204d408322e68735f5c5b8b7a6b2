Paris Saint-Germain confirmed Friday that Argentine winger Angel Di Maria will leave the club after seven years with the French champions. The 34-year-old, who joined from Manchester United and also played for Real Madrid, will play his final match for PSG in Saturday’s season finale against Metz. “He will be remembered by supporters as a player with an irreproachable state of mind, who has shown an unfailing commitment to defend our colours,” said club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi. In 294 matches, Di Maria scored 91 goals. He is expected to move to Juventus in Italy next season. AFP
