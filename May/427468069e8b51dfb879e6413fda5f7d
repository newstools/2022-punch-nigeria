The PUNCH had reported that South-West APC presidential aspirants and leaders met on Friday in Lagos State over the 2023 presidency. He said, “I feel so fulfilled and elated about the roles played by our elderstatesmen Chief Bisi Akande and Chief Olusegun Osoba for their reconciliatory moves and desires to restore peace in South West APC, especially among our big wigs and pillars who are jostling for the presidential ticket. I found it extremely laudable. “Honestly, the perceived unhealthy rivalry which has now become social media sensation worries me a lot and has always been my headache each time I think of what becomes of Yorubaland if we fail as a generation to unite for the purpose of our overall interest under this federation and the entity called Nigeria. I can’t but appreciate the giant strides of Chief Bisi Akande and baba Osoba towards an amicable resolution to form a common objective as the 2023 election draws nearer.”
