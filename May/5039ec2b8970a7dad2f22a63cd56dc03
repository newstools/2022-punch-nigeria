The people of Anioma in the Delta North Senatorial District have thrown their weight behind the billionaire lawyer, Ned Nwoko, who had indicated interest to contest for the constituency’s senatorial seat in the forthcoming general elections. The Senior Special Assistant to the Delta State Governor on Financial Matters, Mr Mark Awanyai, said Nwoko was generally accepted based on his pedigree. Nwoko, a former member of the House of Representatives, is aspiring to the Red Chamber of the National Assembly on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party. Awanyai, who made the call in Asaba on Saturday as the PDP was preparing for its primaries, said Nwoko had contributed to the development of the Anioma people. He said, “We need a voice in the Senate. Therefore, our people cannot afford to get it wrong this time round by electing someone who cannot give us quality representation. “If you look at the achievement of some persons who have represented us in the past, there is just little or nothing to show for it. Therefore, we should identify with our best for now by throwing our weight behind his aspiration. “His determination to end gas flaring if he gets to the National Assembly, for example, is instructive. If actualised, that singular act will create jobs for our teeming youths as companies will be there to harness the benefit that lies in ending gas flaring. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
