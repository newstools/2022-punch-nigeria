Enugu Rangers coach, Abdu Maikaba, has hailed the character of his players after their 3-1 comeback win over Heartland in the Oriental derby on Saturday in their Nigeria Professional Football League matchday 27 fixture at the Awka Stadium. Monday Yakubu gave Heartland the lead in the 13th minute but Rangers equalized in the 22nd minute through Ossy Martins while Shedrack Asiegbu ensured that they went into the half time break with a lead putting the hosts in front in the 40th minute. However, Eso Archibong put the game beyond the visitors with a 90th minute goal. The result sees Rangers leapfrog Remo Stars to third on the log after 27 league games. Speaking after the entertaining encounter, Maikaba, hailed his ward for not crumbling after conceding an early goal in the first half. “I’m very happy about the result. Winning a game at this stage of the league anywhere and I’m sure this win will change our position on the log,” Maikaba said after the game. “Sometimes it is part of football coming from behind. When you make mistakes and correct them early then you’re fine. “I’m happy my boys were not destabilised, they were calm even after conceding the goal they kept playing and kept creating chances. We lost some chances and we were able to score some and at the end we won 3-1.” In the other matchday 27 game played on Saturday, Abia Warriors beat Remo Stars 2-0 with goals from Yakub Hammed in the 61st minute and Valentine Odoh in the 80th minute.
