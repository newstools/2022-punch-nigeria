The Anambra State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party’s screening committee has cleared its candidate in the November 6 governorship election, Mr Valentine Ozigbo, for the party’s primaries ahead of the senatorial election in 2023. Ozigbo is contesting the Anambra South Senatorial District seat in the National Assembly. This was contained in the report of the five-man screening committee.. The report, which was signed by Mr Udeh Okoye and other members of the committee, indicated that Mrs Uche Ekwunife and Stella Oduah, who are both sitting Senators, were also cleared. Other members of the screening committee are Mr Eddy Izondu, Dr Angela Mba, Dr Innocent Nwankwo and Alhaji Rukayat Ibrahim. Others who were cleared are Chief Chris Ubah, Ezebiakwa Peace, Tony Nwoye, John Emeka and Obinna Uzoh. Mr Chuma Nzeribe is the only aspirant that was disqualified out of the nine candidates screened. The committee said Nzeribe, a former senator, was disqualified on the grounds of being declared wanted by an existing court order and denial that he had not been tried by any court of law. It said Nzeribe misled the party by not declaring his status in the eyes of the law and as a man who jumped bail and was declared wanted.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
