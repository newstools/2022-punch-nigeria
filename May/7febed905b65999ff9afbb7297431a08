Globally-recognised Nigerian singer, Ayo Balogun, popularly known as Wizkid has announced the completion of his upcoming album, More Love, Less Ego. The Essence crooner made the announcement on his Instagram story late Sunday, as he also appreciated the contributors in the album. Wizkid told his fans that he made the album with lots of love for them. “(I) finished my album days ago! See you soon!! Love you all for real #MLLE,” he wrote. The Grammy-winning singer added, “Special thanks to everyone that helped me put this together. Y’all got a special place in my heart. #MLLE. “I made this one with a lot of love. Opoju!! (It’s plenty) #MLLE.” Hinting on a special show for the album, Wizkid added, “#MLLE LA Special show.” Wizkid had in October 2021 revealed the title of his next album and its release date. Fondly referred to as Big Wiz, the multiple award-winning singer assured his fans that he would not let them wait for so long before releasing the new album. The grammy award winner while celebrating the first anniversary of his previous album, Made In Lagos, took to his verified Instagram page stating that the next album, More Love, Less Ego, would be released on the last day of his tour. Ever since his last album, Made In Lagos, was released in 2020, it has been breaking records internationally. For instance, on October 11, 2021, Wizkid’s smash hit single, ‘Essence’ hit a new peak of No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
