The Peoples Democratic Party’s presidential aspirant and Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, has described the inauguration of the Baro Port in Niger State by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), as dubious. He said this while speaking with the PDP delegates in Niger after meeting their counterparts in Kogi and Gombe states. Tambuwal said, “What President Muhammadu Buhari did to Niger State when he came for the inauguration of the Baro Port that is not in existence is dubious. “Today as I am talking to you, is there anything like Baro Port working? The APC government, led by Buhari, did Niger State 419, they lied because they wanted to get votes.” “Niger is home to the 3 major electricity source but the state barley enjoys steady power supply. This will not happen under my watch. If we fix power, industries will spring up, jobs will be created and automatically, that takes care of one of the root cause of insecurity in Niger and Nigeria.” In his response, the Niger State PDP Chairman, Tanko Beji, said the delegates will not consider any presidential aspirant who did not visit the state to consult with them. He said, “Anyone who visits us has shown that he respects us. It is disrespectful to assume the people would give their votes without consulting with them. “We have agreed that any presidential aspirant who will not visit Niger State will not be considered to get any of our votes. Because you have come here today, we will consider you based on what you have told us. We believe that you will keep your words.” Beji stated that “Nigeria needs rescue and needs an energetic president who will be able to unite every tribe and religion”, adding that “Tambuwal is the one who can achieve this”.
