The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), as of Saturday evening, had yet to sign the Electoral Amendment Act. Confirming this to our correspondent on Saturday after his return from Abu Dhabi, the Emirati Capital, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, debunked earlier reports making the rounds that the Act had been signed by the President. Earlier on Saturday, several online platforms published unconfirmed reports that Buhari had signed the amendment bill, which was transmitted to him by the Senate last week’s Friday. However, Shehu, said he has no knowledge of the signing, saying, “It is news to me too”. Also debunking the report was Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters, House of Representatives, Umar El-Yakub, said the reports are untrue. El-Yakub said, “He couldn’t have signed it yesterday because he was out of the country and he couldn’t have signed already because he’s just entering the country. “I also cannot tell you that he will still not sign it or will not sign it. He’s the President. But if it will be signed later, we will all know.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
