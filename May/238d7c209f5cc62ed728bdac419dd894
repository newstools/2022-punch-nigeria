D’Tigers coach, Mike Brown, has joined Sacramento Kings from fellow NBA side, the Golden States Warriors, where he served as associate head coach to Steve Kerr since 2016. Brown on Tuesday coached the Warriors to a 104-98 win over the Memphis Grizzlies after Kerr missed the game due to COVID-19, helping his side take a 3-1 lead in the semi-finals of the Western Conference play-offs. At Sacramento, Brown will team up with D’Tigers power forward, Chimezie Metu, who established himself as a key player this season, after signing a multi-year contract with the NBA side in April 2021. Brown, who was NBA Coach of The Year in 2009 while managing the Cleveland Cavaliers, has been saddled with the responsibility of reviving the Kings, who finished 12th out of 15 teams in the Eastern Conference during the 2021/22 season, losing 52 games with 30 wins in the regular season. He will also be hoping to help them qualify for the play-offs next season, a feat they last achieved in 2006 under Hall of Fame coach Rick Adelman. Brown’s Sacramento move may come as a huge blow for D’Tigers, who he led to the 2020 Olympics last year in Japan. The coaching positions of D’Tigers and D’Tigress have been uncertain due to the crisis-torn Nigeria Basketball Federation, with the Musa Kida-led faction stating recently that they were working on either announcing new coaches for the men and women’s national teams or retaining the current coaches. Aside from Brown taking up a new role, D’Tigress coach, Otis Hughley, was also recently appointed as head coach of the University of Alabama A&M Bulldogs men’s basketball team. Copyright PUNCH.
