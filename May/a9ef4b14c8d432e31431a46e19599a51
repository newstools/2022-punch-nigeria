Gospel artiste, Jonathan Ibekwe, aka Mr Bigger, has urged the Nigerian government to prioritise the education of children to enable them to fulfill their destiny. He made the statement during a press conference in respect of the launching of his forthcoming album, ‘Umuaka,’ meaning Children, on May 27, 2022. Speaking during the conference, Mr Bigger said he was obeying a divine call to be the voice of children, adding that children’s welfare should be given adequate attention. He said, “If only adults can imbibe and exhibit the sterling qualities of children, the world would be a sweet and blissful place to live in. Children’s welfare should be given the much-needed attention as they are heavenly gifts. “There is a need for the society to positively reassess its commitment to the welfare, education, and progress of its children. But there is decadence in our society. We run an irresponsible system that fails to recognise the destiny of children. “Leaders should sit up because if children’s education is destroyed or tampered with, the future and destiny of the child will be affected.” He noted that he hoped and desired to partner with UNICEF and UNESCO to champion the cause of children and to drive the need for a better environment for children.
