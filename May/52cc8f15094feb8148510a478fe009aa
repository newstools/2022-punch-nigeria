The senator representing Plateau South in the National Assembly, Prof Nora Daduut, has announced that she won’t seek re-election in the forthcoming 2023 poll. At a press conference in Jos on Friday, Daduut, a first-term lawmaker who was elected to the Senate in December 2020 on the platform of the APC after the death of the former occupant, said she would vacate the seat at the end of her tenure to enable others to contribute their quotas to the development of the constituency and the state. The senator said, “I want to use this opportunity to clear the air on some ongoing rumours and unverified reports carried by some online and electronic media alleging that I am seeking re-election and have been denied the opportunity by some major political actors in the state and that I was attacked and threatened to back down from the race for the senatorial seat. “I, Senator (Prof) Nora Ladi Daduut, want to emphatically stress that I have never contemplated seeking re-election at any point in time, nor endeavored to procure a nomination and interest form for the Plateau South Senatorial District race. Secondly, I have never informed anyone that my life was threatened because of the senatorial seat I currently occupy.” Daduut denied having any rift with Governor Simon Lalong, saying, “His Excellency Governor Simon Lalong has been very supportive and I do appreciate all his support thus far. No rift whatsoever exists between me Senator Dame Nora Ladi Daduut, the Senator representing Plateau South, and the state governor. “Any rumour that I have been threatened by Governor Lalong is baseless, false, and mere blackmail, which should be disregarded.”  Copyright PUNCH.
