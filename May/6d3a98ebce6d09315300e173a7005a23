The Resident Electoral Commission Delta State, Mr Monday Tom, has appealed the Deltans to return the stolen Biometric Voter Accreditation System machine to the Commission. Tom made the appeal on Wednesday during a one-day media/civil society organisations roundtable on the Electoral Act, 2022 ahead of 2023 general election. He said, “I want to beg Deltans to return the five Biometric Voter Accreditation System machine stolen during Isoko constituency election. “Please return the machine, you can’t use it. It is invalid for you. The machine is very expensive.” He urged political parties to conduct their primaries in line with the Electoral Act to make work easy for the Commission. Copyright PUNCH.
