A founding member of the Peoples Democratic Party in Sokoto State, Mukhtari Shehu Shagari, has announced his exit from the party. Shagari, a governoship aspirant in the state, who was a former Minister for Water Resources in Sokoto State and ex-Deputy Governor, announced his withrawal shortly after a stakeholders’ meeting. The meeting chaired by the governor produced former Secretary to the State Government as the PDP’s governorship candidate in the forthcoming election. Shagari in a press statement personally signed by himself accused the Sokoto Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, of deceit. He said, “I wish to bring to your notice that I, Mukhtari Shehu Shagari has from today ceased to be a member of the Peoples Democratic Party. “This hard decision is as a result of the series of betrayals that I have suffered in the hands of a Party that deceitfully claims to be a bastion of democracy but has instead become a party of the highest bidder without considering my labor, commitment, sacrifice, investments and service to the Party since 1998. “Apart from my numerous sacrifices and service to the Party, the so-called Peoples Democratic Party has no reward system.” Copyright PUNCH.
