Oluwo of Iwo, Oba AdewaleAkanbi, has lamented division among politicians in the fold of the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party in the South-West region. Oba Akanbi then tasked Vice President Prof Yemi Osinbajo, ex Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, and former Osun State governor, Chief Bisi Akande, to unite all contending political forces in Yorubaland ahead of the 2023 general election. In a statement by the Press Secretary to the monarch, Alli Ibraheem, on Sunday, the royal father also declared that surviving generation may not forgive today’s political leaders in the region if they fail to improve the political fortune of Yorubaland before the general elections. The statement read in part, “I called on the South West APC and PDP, the national leader of APC Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the pioneer acting chairman of the APC, Chief Bisi Akande, Vice President Osinbajo, all Southwest Governors and ministers, ex and serving, to suppress their ego and sustain the political strength of Yorubaland. “Yoruba should present a formidable and intimidating candidate whose credit and merit cut across the nation. The handwriting on the wall is clear. We should bury our egos to move mountains. Missing the golden opportunity will be a collective failure. I’m hopeful the ball has not crossed the bar. “We need an urgent Yoruba political Meeting. Only this, I think can prevent us from dancing naked in the marketplace and coming home barefooted. I appeal to all the stakeholders involved to prevent the rain of doom on the political fortune of Yorubaland by putting our house in order. It is not too late. But tomorrow maybe.” Copyright PUNCH.
