He pointed out that he would be focused on the transformation of the economy of the state with the creation of jobs for Abia people through private sector-driven initiatives. Ogah said, “Nigeria is blessed with many natural resources that if we harness them less emphasis will be placed in the oil sector and our country will not play a second fiddle in the world. “I will bring my experience in the private and public sector to bring valuable changes in lives of Abia people. “My administration will be anchored on faith in God and social transformation in governance which will transform the economic, agricultural, educational, security and health sector of the state. “I want to reinvent the dreams of our founding fathers of Abia where the rule of law shall thrive and we will reintroduce the agricultural revolution of the former Eastern region that made the economy of that region one of the fastest growing economy in world.
