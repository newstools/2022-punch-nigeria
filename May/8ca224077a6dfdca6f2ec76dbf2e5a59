The Ogun State government has said that seven communities in Agbara/Igbesa, Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government Area of Ogun State have received a resettlement scheme survey plan that covers 36 hectares of land to pave the way for community expansion. According to a statement signed by  Ogun State Property & Investment Corporation, OPIC, Press Officer, Olabisi Adegbite, the benefitting communities were: Iperin, Idoluba, Idoluboti, Titito, Adedigba, Idashe, and Iludofin. He said the scheme would allow the affected communities to resettle within OPIC Estate in Agbara/ Igbesa. Speaking at the handover of the plan to the benefiting communities in Abeokuta, the Special Adviser and Managing Director, OPIC, Arc. Abiodun Fari-Arole, said the move would prevent further encroachment by land grabbers known as ‘Omo Onile’ on state government land and preserve its assets. Fari- Arole stated that it would also generate more revenue into government coffers through land ratification, land use, neighborhood service charges, building plan approval, and perfection of title documents, among others, by intending buyers in the settlement, enjoining members of the communities to ensure peaceful coexistence with one another. In his remarks, Olodan of Odan Abuja Sule, Oba Tesilimi Ayinla, said the people of the area would continue to support Prince Dapo Abiodun’s led administration, promising that they would be in unity. Speaking on behalf of representatives of the benefiting communities, the Chairman Expansion Committee, Hon.
