Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, has endorsed the Senator representing Kaduna Central, Uba Sani, as his successor in 2023. The PUNCH reliably gathered that the lawmaker will pick the incumbent Deputy Governor, Dr Hadiza Balarabe, as his running mate for the 2023 governorship election. The Deputy Governor was said to be the preferred candidate of the governor but he was prevailed upon by some powerful forces. With this development, the former Chief of Staff and Commissioner of Budget and Planning in the state, Mohammed Sani-Dattijo, has lost out in the contest to govern the state in 2023. Dattijo’s message to his supporters said he accepted the latest development coming from the governor as the will of God. The former commissioner said, “At a meeting on Wednesday, the governor directed that we rally round Senator Uba Sani for the governorship seat. He said that I should pick up the Senatorial form for Kaduna Central. “While this outcome is not what we have planned or hoped for, we have accepted it as Allah’s will who provides to whom he wishes, when he wishes. Therefore, we have entrusted our future to Him and prayed that the state and nation will have the best of leaders in 2023.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
