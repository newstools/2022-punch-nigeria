A banker and former governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress in Abia State, Chief Alex Otti, has formerly joined Labour Party. Otti, who announced his withdrawal from the APC governorship primaries on Tuesday, declared for LP in his campaign office in Umuahia, the State capital, on Friday. He joined LP with a factional chairman of the APC in the state, Chief Acho Obioma. Also, the lawmaker representing Isiala Ngwa North State constituency in the Abia State House of Assembly, Chief Ginger Onwusibe, dumped the Peoples Democratic Party for Labour Party. Otti said he joined the Labour Party to continue his fight to liberate Abia from bad governance and lack of development. “I have come to work for you, Abians. The days of non-payment of salaries would be over and I promise to tackle insecurity and unemployment. “I cry each time I see Aba. I will fix Aba. Umuahia is a glorified village, no development. Enough is enough,” he said. In a remark, the ex-factional leader of the APC in the state told Otti’s supporters that he was in the same boat with him In the same vein, Onwusibe lamented that despite his contributions to the PDP and his lofty achievements in Isiala Ngwa North, he was treated like a stranger. He urged his supporters and all lovers of good governance to use their PVCs to avenge the injustice done to him. He said, “My understanding of the political terrain of Ngwa block and other parts of Abia and the competency of Dr Alex Otti would make Labour Party take over Abia State in 2023.”  Copyright PUNCH.
