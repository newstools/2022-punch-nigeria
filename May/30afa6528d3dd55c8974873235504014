The infighting between the immediate governor of Imo State, Emeka Ihedioha, and the National Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, Samuel Anyanwu, has compelled the Imo State chapter of the PDP to suspend its state House of Assembly and House of Representatives primaries indefinitely. While Ihedioha is publicly supporting the presidential ambition of the Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, Anyanwu is said to be supporting his longtime friend and political benefactor, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State. The clash of interest led to the Independent National Electoral Commission invalidating the three-man ad-hoc delegates congress and one-man statutory national delegates election held in the state after it was allegedly marred by crisis. The PDP, in a statement on Saturday by its Organising Secretary in the state, Law Biaduo, announcement that the planned primaries would no longer hold. “A new date and further directives regarding these elections shall be communicated to all concerned as soon as possible. All members of our great party are advised to remain calm,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
