The Medical Director of Alimosho General Hospital, Igando, Dr Ayodapo Soyinka, has enjoined all members of staff of the hospital to imbibe a positive attitude as part of efforts to enhance service delivery. Soyinka made the call, according to a statement on Sunday, during the commencement of the facility’s attitude week, a three-day programme held in Lagos. He said, “This programme was designed to expose workers to the inherent benefit of having a positive attitude to work and interactions with others. “We want all the staff members to embrace positive attitude because it enhances improved service delivery.” In his lecture, the Chief Executive Officer of Nederland International, Prof Lere Baale, advised staff members to ensure that they exhibit good behaviour because the hospital is a place of succour. “The hospital is a place of succour and as such, it is imperative for healthcare workers to understand that life is more influenced by individual attitudes. As a staff member, you should exhibit good behaviour at all times even when it seems your positive disposition is not acknowledged because a positive-minded person will surely be rewarded and the display of the right attitude will conquer everything.” Copyright PUNCH.
