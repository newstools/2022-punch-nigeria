Nollywood actress, Iretiola Doyle, has knocked filmmaker, Niyi Akinmolayan, for criticising influencers who have delved into acting. The Chief Daddy director had earlier berated “influencer actors”, as he called them, for not going the extra mile to perform their movie roles. He noted that such actors demand challenging roles but do not show up for rehearsals when the time comes. The Anthill Studios founder tweeted, “‘I want challenging role’.’I want challenging role’. Can you train for 3 weeks for free. No!! “Can refuse other jobs for 2 months to be in character without being paid? No. So you see, my dear actor and critics who want challenging roles, challenging roles need challenging money. “Ordinary table read, you will not show up, talk less of rehearsals. But you want challenging roles. Influencer actor lol” Responding to the tweet, Doyle blamed producers for going after influencers rather than actors with talent and zeal. She said, “Perhaps if casting is based on talent and the hunger to succeed as opposed to social media numbers and who is willing to push YOUR film aggressively (at no added cost), producers wouldn’t have this particular problem.” Copyright PUNCH.
