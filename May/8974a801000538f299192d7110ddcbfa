Former England player of Nigerian descent, John Fashanu, has questioned Unai Emery’s decision to start Samuel Chukwueze from the bench, following Villarreal’s 5-2 aggregate loss to Liverpool in the semi-final of the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday. The Reds overcame a spirited Yellow Submarines’ performance to book their spot in the Champions League final with a 3-2 away win, netting three second-half goals after seeing their first-leg lead wiped out in Spain. The Nigeria international has been the Yellow Submarines’ shining star in recent weeks and his decisive late goal against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena helped Villarreal secure a shock 2-1 aggregate victory that sent the Germans crashing out of the competition in the quarter-finals. Despite his stellar performance in recent weeks, Chukuweze was left on the bench until he was brought on in the 70th minute for Gerard Moreno, who struggled with a thigh injury for the most part of the game. Speaking with PUNCH Sports Extra, Fashanu told Emery that he was wrong to have benched the Nigerian. “I think it was a big mistake by the coach, we must all learn that in football, when a team loses, there has to be somebody to be held accountable.
