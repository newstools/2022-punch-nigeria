The Kano State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps has accused some petroleum marketers of illegally diverting Premium Motor Spirit meant to be sold at the approved N165 per litre. This was contained in a statement by the command’s Public Relations Officer, Ibrahim Abdullahi, which was issued in Kano on Sunday. Abdullahi stated, “The attitude of these ingrate marketers is illegal and amounts to economic sabotage. This will never be condoned nor tolerated. “Based on this, the state command of the NSCDC has since spread its intelligence network and if anybody is caught in this illegality he/she shall be made to face the full wrath of the law.” “Conversely, the corps wishes to show appreciation to the right-thinking marketers for their cooperation, understanding and the sales of the petroleum products to the buyers at the right price. “The attitude of these patriotic marketers is worthy of emulation and, therefore, highly commendable.”  Copyright PUNCH.
