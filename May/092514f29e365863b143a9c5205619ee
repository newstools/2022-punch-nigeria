The National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party has cancelled all primaries in Ebonyi State. The National Publicity Secretary of the party, Debo Ologunagba, announced the development in a statement on Sunday afternoon. He said the PDP NWC took the decision after “very extensive consultations, deliberations and review of all issues” surrounding the primaries in the South-East state. Some of the issues raised by aspirants include electoral fraud. The statement titled, ‘PDP Cancels Primaries in Ebonyi State’ partly read, “To this effect, all State House of Assembly, National Assembly and Governorship primaries of our Party in Ebonyi State are hereby cancelled. “The NWC will announce new dates for the affected Party exercises in the State. “The PDP charges all aspirants, critical stakeholders, leaders and members of our great Party in Ebonyi State to remain calm, united and focused as the PDP takes firm steps to rescue our nation from the misrule of the rudderless, corrupt and incompetent All Progressives Congress.” The PDP presently has governors in 13 states while the APC controls the rest with the exception of Anambra State which is ruled by the All Progressives Grand Alliance. Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, had dumped the PDP for the APC in December 2020 over a superiority contest with Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike. The PDP announced Wike’s contender and former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar as its 2023 presidential candidate on Sunday after a primary in Abuja. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
