Family members of a 70-year-old woman, Mrs Victoria Ojimi, are in distress after her sudden disappearance from Abiodun Street, in the Okearo area of Ondo State, where she lived with her daughter and grandchildren. The victim, a retired teacher said to be suffering from dementia, was said to have left her house around 7pm on Saturday, April 30. Her son, Mr Temitope Oluwadeyi, said efforts to find her had been abortive. Oluwadeyi noted that the family reported the incident to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Okearo Police Division and the ‘B’ division, Okearo. The woman’s first daughter, Mrs Gbonjuola Ojo, who lived with her, said, “Grandma, I and the children were at my brother’s house. When there was a power outage, we moved to her house and then I went to the kitchen to cook. “While I was cooking, she said she wanted to go to her late father’s house, where she used to live and sold goods. I told her not to leave the house because I was cooking and she agreed. “And then, I decided to check what I was cooking. But when I returned, I could not find her.” Another daughter, Mrs Bukola Jerry, said, “Our family checked everywhere in search of her, but we couldn’t find her. We also reported the matter at radio stations, all to no avail.” The Ondo State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Funmilayo Omisanya, confirmed the incident, adding that investigations were ongoing. She noted that Mrs Ojo had been invited to make a formal report. Omisanya said, “The victim has not been found yet. The DPO has sent the case to his boss. Mrs Ojo has been invited to the police station to come with a report on Wednesday, May 4, 2022, thereafter she will be notified of subsequent updates.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
