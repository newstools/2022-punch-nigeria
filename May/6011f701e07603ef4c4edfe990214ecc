Genk manager, Bernd Storck, has backed striker Paul Onuachu to return to his best when they face Sporting Charleroi on Friday (today) in the Belgian league UEFA Europa Conference League play-offs. Genk has been involved in two Conference League play-offs, earning a 1-0 win over Gent and a 4-2 victory over Mechelen. Despite being in the starting line-up for both encounters, the Nigeria international has fired blanks, but his manager is hoping he will bounce back ahead of the fixture against Charleroi. “We know what’s wrong, it is also logical that there are sometimes bad days. But we want to quickly bring him back to his best level,” Storck said. Onuachu is also looking to make a scoring impact in the encounter having spoken to his teammates about the tactics. “We are making progress as a team, everyone is more aware of what their specific tasks entail,” Onuachu said ahead of the game. “I will indeed have to make certain choices. I’ve already talked about that with some players.” The game will be a tough one for Charleroi who have lost both of their Conference League play-offs games so far, most recently the 3-1 at home to Gent last Saturday. Despite failing to match the performance he put out in the 2020/21 campaign, Onuachu has found the back of the net 21 times in 31 games in all competitions.  All rights reserved.
