In his keynote speech, Awe noted that there were various platforms through which small businesses could penetrate international markets. The former chairman of NACCIMA Export Group added that if Nigeria diversified  her economy, it would favour small businesses in export. He said, “Basically, the trade fair is one of the platforms that SMEs can use to showcase their goods, and it is very instrumental to the development as marketing strategy for SMEs because of the attractions and the varieties of products that come with trade fairs.
