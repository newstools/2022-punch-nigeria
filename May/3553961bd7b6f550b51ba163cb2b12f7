The Chairman, Oye Local Government Area of Ekiti State, Mr. Sunday Ajimoko, has advised students of the area against indulging in crimes, following the prolonged strike action of the Academic Staff Union of Universities. Ajimoko gave the advice in an interview with newsmen in Oye-Ekiti on Thursday. He said it was regrettable that the ongoing strike had kept all the students at home with most of them idle and bored. He warned the students, especially indigenes of Oye-Ekiti to stay away from social vices such as kidnapping, drug abuse, stealing, cyber fraud, and rape, which could jeopardise their future. The chairman said that ignorance was not an excuse in the court of law, adding that the best step a student could take during the strike was to acquire skills such as tailoring, hairdressing, cake baking, and barbing. “As a parent and concerned stakeholder in education, I want to advise and equally warn our students to stay away from crimes during this prolonged strike by ASUU. “I am aware that most of them are idle, bored and they miss their various universities but being idle can be very dangerous. “I want to advise every student to embrace skill acquisition programmes such as tailoring, hairdressing, cake baking, and barbing to enable them to get busy during this period,” he said. According to him, acquiring skills will help the students to be properly engaged till ASUU decides to call off the strike. Ajimoko warned that any student caught indulging in crime would be arrested and prosecuted without considering the reason for his or her actions. NAN
