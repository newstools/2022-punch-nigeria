The Governor of Ebonyi State and presidential hopeful on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, David Umahi, has said he cannot share money like other aspirants in the race for the 2023 presidency. Speaking to The PUNCH, Umahi, however, stated that he is more qualified than others in the race to lead the country due to his experience and the fear he has for God. Urging Nigerians to rise above money politics, the governor reminded citizens that if the country sinks, it will affect everyone. He said, “Our country has moved to a very unfortunate stage where we believe that money answers all things. I know of somebody who used to say that what money cannot do, more money can do that. “We are talking about who can do this job, we are not talking about how much money you have because when you say how much money you have, from which company did you make such money? And so, we are in a critical stage of our nation and we should be very much interested in talking about those who can do the job. “I thought that the nation should be able to see and x-ray the leaders, past and present, and talk on essentials, the intellectual capacities to do the job, the capacities, the strength, and the calling to do the job.” The governor, who advised others aspiring to be President to rely on their achievements in previous positions instead of dishing out promises, said, “I stand out to do this job but if you are considering the volume of money, I shouldn’t even contest in the first place because I don’t have the kind of money many of them have, I have done the job in Ebonyi, I have not stolen money, I have not saved money but I have a name and I have legacies.” Copyright PUNCH.
