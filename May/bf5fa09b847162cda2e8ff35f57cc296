A presidential aspirant on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party and Governor of Bauchi State, Bala Mohammed, on Friday visited Benue State and consulted with national delegates. On his arrival, he paid a courtesy visit to Governor Samuel Ortom where he promised to be a bridge builder between the North and the South. While decrying the hopeless situation in the country, Mohammed promised to reposition the country, adding that he could be trusted with presidency of Nigeria. He said,”We come to pay our courtesy and respect, to meet leaders and to tell them we are stepping out not because of our size but because of the country. “We know the sensibilities and the feelings of other sections of the country who have given us reason, spirit of self-determination and self-actualisation. We know the feelings in the South as well in the North and we need a bridge builder like me, who has done it before to rescue the country on the brinks. “I think that I’m properly mentored to understand the country and to really work as a team player, as a leader to rescue this country. I’m not the best, the best may be you or others but I have stepped out and I need your support.” Fielding questions from journalists on restructuring, the presidential aspirant said, “Majority of our people live at the sub-nationals and local government levels. We must come up with a template, that’s part of the restructuring; you cannot surrender safety and security to a clueless administration at the centre; you cannot allow exclusion and nepotism to drive disillusionment and to cause misconception up to the extent of threatening our collective heritage as Nigerians.”  Copyright PUNCH.
