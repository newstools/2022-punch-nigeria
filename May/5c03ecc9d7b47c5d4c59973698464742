A Peoples Democratic Party member aspiring to represent Ikorodu Constituency 1 in the Lagos State House of Assembly, Rotimi Olatunbosun, has promised to boost education and healthcare of his constituents if elected. The aspirant, according to a statement on Sunday, made the promise during the declaration of his intention to contest at an event in Ikorodu. Olatunbosun also noted that he had organised vocational programmes for youths in the area in order to be gainfully employed and financially empowered. He said, “In our manifesto, we have programmes for education. We have noticed over the years that our young ones are leaving schools without any concrete plans by the government for them in the labour market. Similarly, there are some children, who want to go to school, but do not have finance or support to do so. We can do something for these set of children and I am delighted to inform you that we have programmes for all of such situations. “We also have a strategically structured health programme for the less privileged in the society. The programme is a sort of free Health Maintenance Organisations for people in the constituency to take care of minor health challenges such as malaria, high blood pressure  and even common feverish condition.” Copyright PUNCH.
