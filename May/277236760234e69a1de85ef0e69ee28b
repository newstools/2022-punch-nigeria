Commercial activities at the popular Transcorp Hilton were paralysed on Monday following the arrival of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, at the party’s presidential screening. The frontline presidential aspirant stormed the venue of the APC screening with about a hundred of his supporters. The chaos that followed his presence at the reception gave many guests and officials tough times. The shout of ‘Nigeria’s next president’ rented the hall as security officials struggled to contain the crowd. The real drama, however, began when the restless supporters and praise singers held the former Lagos State governor hostage in the lift for almost 10 minutes. It took the timely intervention of policemen to prevent the crowd from forcing their way into the lift. Tinubu arrived at the venue around 6p.m on Monday evening. Apart from Tinubu, other aspirants on the list of those to be screened include; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmed Lawan and former ministers Rotimi Amaechi, Ogbonnaya Onu, Godswill Akpabio, and Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba. Serving governors who are also listed for the screening are Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti), Yahaya Bello (Kogi), Dave Umahi (Ebonyi), Ben Ayade (Cross River) and Badaru Abubakar (Jigawa). Copyright PUNCH.
