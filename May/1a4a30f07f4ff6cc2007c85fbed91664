A suspected robber was on Saturday beaten to death by an angry mob in the Charanchi Local Government Area of Katsina State. The deceased, along with four other members of the gang, had reportedly robbed a 52-year-old man, Alhaji Usman Abdulmumini, of his Honda car, valued at N2.6m. Sources revealed that the hoodlums descended on Abdulmumini while he was supervising his farm in the nearby Kankia Local Government Area of the state. It was learnt that the police received a distress call after the car was snatched. The state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Gambo Isah, who confirmed the incident, said on sighting the police team, the robbers attempted to reverse the car and speed off. An angry mob was reported to have caught up with the robbers and descended on them, leading to the death of one of the assailants. Isah said, “On Saturday, around 12 noon, a distress call was received that armed robbers numbering about five in a motor vehicle attacked one Alhaji Usman Abdulmumini, 52, while supervising work at his farm and snatched his Honda, valued at N2,600,000. “On receipt of the report, the DPO, Charanchi, led a team of policemen and blocked the Katsina-Kano highway at Charanchi town. Consequently, the team successfully intercepted the stolen motor vehicle driven by one of the robbers, who tried to beat the police checkpoint and reversed, but was subsequently intercepted by some community members and beaten to death. “In the course of searching the motor vehicle, one Makarov pistol with five rounds of 0.8mm ammunition was recovered in his possession. “The command is making efforts with a view to arresting other members of the syndicate that escaped in the other vehicle.”  Copyright PUNCH.
