Singer, Iledare Oluwajuwonlo, aka Jaywon, says he decided to feature rave-of-the moment artiste, Portable, on his song, Zelle, because the latter asked him to. In an interview with Sunday Scoop, he said, “I featured Portable because he asked me to. He jokingly told me not to release my album without him on it.  I told him that if he could be available as soon as possible, I would put him on it. That was how we made the remix of ‘Zelle’. Though I had already picked a date for the release of the original song, I went ahead to put out the remix.” Asked what inspired the song, the singer said, “The song was inspired by an experience I had in the United States of America. I was trying to give a friend some money and he said, ‘But you have my number? Zelle the money’. Apparently, Zelle is a quick money transfer app popularly used over there. I did not even know a lot of Nigerians were familiar with it, to the extent that some were saying I was now into cybercrime.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
