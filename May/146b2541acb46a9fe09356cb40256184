A former Pro-Chancellor Council University of Calabar, Senator Nkechi Nwaogu, has withdrawn from the All Progressives Congress senatorial primary conducted on Saturday. In a letter addressed to the national chairman of the APC, Abdullahi Adamu, through her Ward Chairman in Isiala Ngwa South, Abia State, Nwaogu stated she decided to withdraw from the race owing to the undemocratic manner the three-man delegates primaries in the state was conducted. She said the undemocratic process has given undue advantage to a few individuals, to the detriment of the majority of the party members who had wanted to contest the primary. The letter partly read, “The undemocratic process in choosing delegates for the primaries, brewed confusion that led to the party having two gubernatorial candidates from two different governorship primaries. “While chief Ikechi Emenike emerged through an indirect primary election, the former Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development, Uche Ogah emerged through a direct primary. “Following the anomalies in the party I have withdrawn my participation in the Senatorial primary election. I will still remain an active member of our party APC and ready to serve the party in any capacity”. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
