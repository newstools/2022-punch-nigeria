The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Monday, commiserated with families of those who died, sustained injuries, and were affected in the building collapse at Ebute Metta area of Lagos State, with search and rescue still ongoing at the site. He also lamented the “embarrassing” frequency of building collapse in the country. This comes after a three-storey building collapsed on Sunday night at 32, Ibadan Street, Ebute Metta, Lagos. Buhari’s condolence message is contained in a statement signed on Monday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina. The statement is titled ‘President Buhari condoles with victims of Lagos building collapse’. According to Adesina, “The President, who is pained by this tragic incident, salutes the courage and determination of the first responders, national and sub-national emergency agencies in Lagos State, and compassionate Nigerians, whose immediate action in the aftermath of the collapse of the three-storey building led to the rescue of several persons, including many children. “Regrettably, the President notes that the frequency of building collapses in the country has become increasingly embarrassing, urging the relevant state authorities to work closely with professional bodies to put a halt to these unfortunate but preventable incidents.” He, therefore, wished those injured a speedy recovery and prayed for divine assistance in the ongoing search and rescue operations.
