The former Anambra State Governor gave the warning on Sunday via his verified Twitter handle. According to the 60-year-old politician, it has been brought to his attention that some of his reporters were attacking other aspirants and candidates. While thanking his supporters for being on his side, he begged them to “imbibe the spirit of sportsmanship” and avoid name-calling his competitors.
