Following allegations of bribe-for-votes between aspirants of the All Progressives Congress and party delegates in different states, APC National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, on Wednesday has said there was no evidence to substantiate the claim. Adamu, who debunked the claim in an interview with Voice of America Hausa service, noted that he got feelers that the reverse was the case. According to him, there is no law in the country stopping presidential aspirants from taking their electioneering campaign to delegates across the country. The APC national chairman stated that he discovered the delegates who have been hawking their conscience to the highest bidders. “For now, there is no law against aspirants taking campaign to delegates. I don’t have evidence that aspirants are sharing money to delegates. For me it’s the delegates that are selling their conscience which is not proper. “Our delegates should know that anybody sharing money to them can’t be the right candidate of the party. He doesn’t mean well for the country. I don’t have solution for the problem,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
