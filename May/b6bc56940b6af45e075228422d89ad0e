The race for Nigeria international, Victor Osimhen, has taken another dimension after Italian champions AC Milan joined in the battle to sign the striker, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Osimhen has been linked with Manchester United and Newcastle United in the past few weeks and recent reports suggest that Arsenal have also tabled a significant bid for the 23-year-old. Osimhen missed a chunk of last season through injuries and other health-related issues but managed to score 14 goals with six assists in what was his second season with the Italian outfit. The Nigerian’s performance has now caught the eye of Milan’s director Paolo Maldini, who is targeting the striker as a possible replacement for the ageing Zlatan Ibrahimovic. “The Rossoneri have entered the race for the number nine of Napoli, identified as a great reinforcement for next season,” an Italian publication, AreaNapoli, wrote. “Milan, freshly won the Scudetto, are thinking of Victor Osimhen for next season. The director Paolo Maldini has targeted the number nine of Napoli.” Osimhen was recently named the Best Young Player of the 2021/22 Serie A season, beating the likes of Juventus’ Dusan Vlahovic, Leao of AC Milan and Sassuolo’s duo Gianluca Scamacca and Giacomo Raspadori to the prestigious award despite scoring fewer goals.
