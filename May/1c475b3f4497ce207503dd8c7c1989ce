The Peoples Democratic Party, on Saturday in Abuja, has called for the immediate arrest and investigation of the Governor of the Central Bank, Dr Godwin Emefiele, for violating public service rules by way of his alleged involvement in the race for the 2023 presidency in the All Progressives Congress. The PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, made the call on Saturday during a press conference at the party’s National Secretariat at Wadata Plaza. This is coming barely 24 hours after a group consisting of farmers and businesspersons purchased the N100m presidential nomination and expression of interest forms for the CBN Chief. According to Ologunagba, “Our party received intelligence that the CBN governor is being promoted by the presidency. The CBN Act 2007 section 9 says the Governor and Deputy Governor shall devote the entirety of their time to the bank and shall not engage in part-time employment whether with remuneration or not. “The CBN is a critical organ of the state and with this development, the CBN governor can no longer continue to operate in his current capacity. “Emefiele has become a present danger to the nation’s financial sector as his presence in the race will deter investors and diminish the confidence of foreign investors in the Nigerian economy. “We, therefore, demand the immediate arrest and investigation of Mr Emefiele for alleged financial malfeasance and use of state resources to fund his ambition.” The PUNCH had earlier reported that the CBN governor, in a tweet, denied his involvement in the presidential race, saying he was yet to decide.
