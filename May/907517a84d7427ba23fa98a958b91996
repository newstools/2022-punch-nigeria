The Monday sit-at-home has once again paralysed activities in some parts of Anambra as banks, schools, markets, motor parks, and fuel stations were shut. Several roads across major cities such as Onitsha, Nnewi, Oba, Obosi, Ekwulobia and some parts of Awka were empty as vehicles deserted the roads. The Monday sit-at-home declared by the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, which the group said had said on several occasions that it has cancelled today coincided with May 30, which is always being celebrated as “Biafra Day” across the globe. Also, it was gathered that gunmen late on Sunday killed an unidentified policeman at Ogidi, Idemili North Local Government Area of the state and dispossessed him of his rifle. In a viral video circulating online, the policeman was seen lying in a pool of his blood while a group of people gathered around the corpse. As of the time of filing this report, the police spokesperson, Ikenga Tochukwu, could not be reached as he did not take his call nor respond to a text message sent to his phone line. Copyright PUNCH.
