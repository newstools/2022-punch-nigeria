ARCHITECTS, under the aegis of the Lagos State Chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Architects, have called for a public-private partnership in order to have a state that is sustainable. Chairman of the chapter, David Majekodunmi, made the call on Wednesday during his opening remarks at the 13th edition of the Lagos Architects Forum. Majekodunmi noted that Lagos remained one of the most famous cities in the world, and there must be a degree of intentionality to the planning of the state to avoid losing its strategic relevance. He said, “The theme for this year’s event is ‘The City of Lagos: What is Lagos?’ Lagos should be one of the most famous cities in the world, which can be referred to as ‘the Big City of Africa’. This vibrant city is known for its uniqueness as an economic hub, flashy cultural lifestyle, high-flying business hob, and it is a city that has long captivated people from all over the world.” He noted that Lagos was the first capital of Nigeria, where Abubakar Tafawa Balewa took the oath of office to become the country’s first prime minister. He called on allied industry players, private and public sectors to actively engage in discussions and ideas that would ensure a sustainable Lagos State. “Our emphasis is on the future of Lagos City through collaboration, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Through topical discussions, debates and interactions, stakeholders and key players will have ample opportunities to share ideas and critical insights into review and proffer solutions on how to effectively midwife a liveable and sustainable Lagos State and by extension Federal Republic of Nigeria.”  Copyright PUNCH.
