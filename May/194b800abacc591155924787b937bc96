One person was feared killed when suspected members of a cult group clashed in the Diobu axis of Mile One in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. It was gathered that the clash involved the D12 and BS members of the Degbam cult group. A source who spoke on condition of anonymity said he heard gunshots while walking on Akwuzu Street, in Mile One, and quickly fled. “Suddenly people started running in different directions. Then I heard gunshots. I think they shot someone. The man the suspected cultists shot ran some distance and later fell down. The people that shot him entered their vehicle and zoomed off,” he added. A member of a vigilance group, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told City Round that the suspected cultists were armed with dangerous weapons. He described the attack as a reprisal, noting that the suspected cultists went in search of a rival group believed to be responsible for the killing of one of their members. It was, however, learnt that some policemen from the divisional police headquarters in Diobu went to the scene and reportedly evacuated the corpse of the slain suspected cultist. Acting spokesperson of the state police command, Grace Iringe-Koko, confirmed the incident, saying investigation was on to apprehend the suspects. She said, “Yes, we are aware of the incident. We are still investigating to apprehend the suspect and make them face justice.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
