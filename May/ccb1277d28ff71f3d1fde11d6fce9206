The All Progressives Congress, South-East, has announced the shifting of its gubernatorial and House of Representatives primary election exercise to May 25 over a sit-at-home order. This was said to be due to the “need to protect delegates who would be trooping out in their numbers to elect candidates in the five South-East states.” In a statement put out by its National Vice-Chairman, Dr. Ijeomah Arodiogbu, the reasons given cited the fact that the earlier slated date of May 26, 2022, had been declared as sit-at-home day and it had, thus, become imperative for the zone to consider first the safety of the party’s teeming supporters. The statement went on to fix May 25 as the new date while apologising for any inconvenience such a shift may have had on party members and aspirants. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
