Technology company, Globacom, has urged girls in secondary schools to take up careers in the Information and Communications Technology sector. This, the company said, would enable them to tap into the huge opportunities in the sector in Nigeria and across the globe. According to a statement made available to journalists on Tuesday, the firm made the call at the 2022 Girls in ICT Day held in Lagos. It said the students should prioritise the study of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to equip themselves for the opportunities in ICT. International Girls in ICT Day is an initiative of the International Telecommunications Union. The theme of this year’s event is “Access and Safety” and it seeks to draw attention to the need for girls and young women to thrive in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths)  by using access to safe and reliable internet and digital tools. Globacom’s representative at the event and Senior Manager, Human Resources Management, Mrs. Jumoke Aduwo, in a presentation on the topic, “Globacom as an equal opportunity employer and a key driver in the ICT industry in Nigeria,” stated that STEM subjects were necessary for anyone wishing to make a career in ICT. She argued that having more women in the field would place Nigeria on par with trends in the developed world. She also called on the students selected from different secondary schools in Lagos and Ogun states to imbibe the virtues of diligence, integrity, and other acceptable best practices that will empower them to occupy their rightful places in Nigeria and abroad.
