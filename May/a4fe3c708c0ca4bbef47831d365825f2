A former Vice President and presidential aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, has accused the ruling All Progressives Congress of causing disunity among the diverse elements of the country. Atiku, who described the alleged disunity of the country as unprecedented, promised to unite Nigerians if he is elected as the president of the country. The former vice president stated this while speaking with the PDP delegates from Ondo State in Akure, the state capital on Sunday evening. According to Atiku, the whole country had been messed up in all sectors by the current adminstration and needed a person who is experienced and nationally acceptable to turn around the bad state of the nation. He said, ” The APC government has caused disunity I have never seen in my life in this country. If I’m elected I will reunite every part of the country .” If elected, the PDP presidential aspirant enumerated five areas where he would work on to include, unity, insecurity, economy, education, and restructuring. “I believe in a small Federal Government, the power should be devolved to the states. “We must vote for a person with national acceptability and experience. Atiku Abubakar is a household name in this country, we deserve the best for this country,” Atiku said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
