Nigerian crossdresser and entertainer, Denrele Edun, on Wednesday revealed that he didn’t like actress Ini Edo the first time he saw her. He said this on his Instagram page while wishing the actress a belated 40th birthday. Edo turned 40 on April 23 but in a lengthy post late Wednesday, Denrele talked about his friendship with the actress. The show host wrote, “The first time I saw you, I actually didn’t like you. But now I’ve come to understand you. ‘I dey your corner,’ Ini told me at the opening of her lounge. “And that’s INI for you; blunt, truthful, and politely sarcastic with those all-pervading Eyeballs of hers that see everything (even if she pretends to be unaware). “My WCW (Women Crush Wednesday) for life! Welcome to the fourth floor #iniedo . It suits you well. “Better late than never; A happy 40th to the dangerously deliciously sexy Iniobong Edo Ekim.” Sharing one of their experiences at a show, Denrele said, ” I recall dragging her sometime in 2009 to the Soundcity studios in Lekki for her ‘Star Host’ episode. “That day was an electrifying excitement in the office! The entire production, post production, management, admin and Media team gathered in the Studio to watch her. ALL MALE at that! “I was worried that she might get uncomfortable and postpone the recording. She didn’t mind, actually. “She told me, ‘They want a show right? I’ll give it to them!’. We laughed hard after that.” He then described the actress as “bold, brazen, unstoppable, and a fireball of seething ENERGY!” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
