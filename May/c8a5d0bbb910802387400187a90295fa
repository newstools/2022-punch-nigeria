Juventus won women’s Serie A for the fifth season in a row on Saturday, completing a record run of league crowds with a match to spare in the current campaign. The Turin giants clinched the title thanks to a 3-1 win over Sassuolo which maintained their five-point lead over Roma, who can no longer catch their rivals. Goals from Barbara Bonansea, Cristiana Girelli and Lisa Boattin made sure that former Arsenal coach Joe Montemurro would win the Italian title in his first season at the helm. The run of five straight titles is one better than the prevous record established between 2010 and 2013 by Sassari Torres, who hold the highest number of league titles of any club in women’s football with seven. Juventus have been the dominant team in women’s Serie A since being formed in 2017 and this year reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League, where they were eliminated by seven-time European champions Lyon. They can complete a domestic double with a win over Roma in the Italian Cup final on May 22. They previously won the trophy in 2019. alu/td/bsp © 1994-2022 Agence France-Presse
