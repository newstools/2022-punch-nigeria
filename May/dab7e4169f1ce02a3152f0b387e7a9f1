The Federal Government has said it is collaborating with the World Health Organisation and the United States Centre for Disease Control concerning getting Nigerians to access the global stockpile of monkeypox vaccination to curb the outbreak of the disease. The Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, who spoke to journalists during the flag-off of ‘COVID-19 vaccination at Community Pharmacies’ on Tuesday in Abuja, said, “The government is emphasising on strict observation of public health safety measures to limit the spread of monkeypox disease across the country. “We are also engaging the World Health Organisation and the United States Centre for Disease Control to see how Nigeria can also access the global stockpile of monkeypox vaccination. “The agency is working with the USCDC to make sure that all of the strategies to limit the spread of monkeypox were put in place. While soliciting the support of the media to help sensitise Nigerians on ways to avoid being infected, he said, “We appreciate the media, and we urge the gentlemen of the press to help inform citizens of the need to stay safe. “Until the vaccines are available, the government is emphasising the use of basic measures to limit the spread of monkeypox disease.” Copyright PUNCH.
