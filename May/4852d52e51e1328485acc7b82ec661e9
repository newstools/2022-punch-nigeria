The Nigerian Army on Monday dismissed claims that some Nigerian villages were attacked by the militants of Ambazonia, a separatist group in South-West Cameroon. The Army, who confirmed that the militants attacked some communities on Sunday, said the attack did not happen on Nigerian territory. According to a statement by the Director, Army Public Relations, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, four victims who ran into the Nigerian territory were saved. The statement read in part, “The Nigerian Army has been notified of a statement insinuating that Nigerian villages were attacked by Cameroonian separatists on May 29, 2022. “Contrary to the misinformation, our troops deployed at Danare received information on Sunday morning about the said attack. The troops immediately mobilised to the Bashu community, which was allegedly under attack. “Upon their arrival, it was revealed that Bashu was not under attack and no external incursion was recorded; rather the separatists attacked Obonyi 2 and Njasha, both of which are communities located in the Republic of Cameroon. Four victims of the attack, who crossed over into the Nigerian territory were later rescued by troops and operatives of Nigerian Immigration Services. The attack was therefore, not within the Nigerian territory as claimed.”  Contact: theeditor@punchng.com Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
