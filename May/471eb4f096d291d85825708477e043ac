An aspirant for the Imo West Senatorial District on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Charles Ahize, has said he will end the insecurity in the Orlu Zone if he picks the ticket of the party. Ahize, who addressed journalists ahead of the APC senatorial primary in the state today (Saturday), said he had the capacity to bring those troubling the area to a roundtable. The businessman turned politician said his candidacy would bring peace in the troubled area. He called on the party to ensure that there was a level playing ground for all the aspirants. Ahize said, “My candidacy will bring absolute peace to Orlu. I am a man of the people and I have the ability to lobby. I will bring the bad boys to a roundtable and plead with them to give peace a chance if I emerge as the candidate. Our people have suffered enough. “Orlu needs a compassionate person as the next senator; someone who understands the needs and challenges of our people. I call on the APC to give us the aspirants a level playing ground. “ He said he was going to the Senate to advocate for equal rights and justice for the people of the South-East region. “I am going to the Senate to advocate equal rights and justice for Ndigbo; to ask for at least another state for the South-East, which should be carved out from the Orlu senatorial district,” he added.
