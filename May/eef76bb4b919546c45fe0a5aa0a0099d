Nollywood actress and show host, Nancy Isime, has said that the trauma she had as a child made her grow up to become a people pleaser. She made this known in a recent interview with fellow actress, Lilian Afegbai. Speaking about her childhood, The Blood Sisters star noted that she didn’t get the attention she required as a child. So when Isime grew, she started wanting people to like her. However, the 30-year-old said that she had gotten to a point in her life when she no longer forced herself on anybody. She said, “I don’t force myself on anybody. I used to be a people pleaser but that came from childhood trauma. “It came from childhood trauma where you’ll be looking for attention as a child and you didn’t get it. “When you get older, you start waning people to like you. So even if it’s breaking you, even if you know that this person does not like you and has said sh*t about you, you think maybe they can change that minds.” She further revealed that self love helped her to stop becoming a people pleaser. “But learning to love myself and being intuitive helped me to heal from being a people pleaser,” the star actress said.
