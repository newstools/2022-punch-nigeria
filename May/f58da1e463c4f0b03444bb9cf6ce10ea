Some suspected cultists on Tuesday engaged men of the Ogun State Police Command in Abeokuta during a supremacy battle between two rival cults. Seven suspected members of the cults, Eiye and Aiye, were reportedly arrested after the clash with the police. The state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Abimbola Oyeyemi, in a statement on Tuesday, said the suspects were arrested while engaging in a supremacy battle in the Ijaye area of Abeokuta. He noted that the suspects — Kazeem Ogundairo, aka NEPA; Nasiru Idris, aka Aloma; Ayo Joshua, aka Terry G; Damilare Shogbamu, aka Dhray; Bisiriyu Owoyele; Taiwo Olaitan  and Labulo Jamiu, aka Jboy — were arrested following a distress call received from residents of the Ijaye area that the cultists were running riot in the community. He said, “Upon the distress call, the Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, directed a special squad led by ACP Bolanle Muritala to move to the scene and bring the situation under control. “On sighting the policemen, some of the hoodlums ran in different directions, while some engaged the policemen with weapons. “At the end of the encounter, the squad succeeded in arresting six of the hoodlums, while others escaped.”  Copyright PUNCH.
