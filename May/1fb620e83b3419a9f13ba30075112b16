A budding singer, songwriter and rapper, Shon Nerat, simply known as Shon, says he always want to stand out on account of his unique style of music. Born in Kano State, he currently resides in his hometown of Jos, the capital of Plateau State. According to him, he grew up with his grandmother and that was when his love for music started. “She always complained that I was disturbing the entire neighborhood with my music, which she used to call ‘noise’”. The entertainer stated that he started writing songs at the age of 11, and recorded his first song titled, My Lord, in 2017 with his best friend and producer, Jace Kim. Speaking on his musical influences, Shon said, “Growing up, I was inspired by genres such as trap, rap, RnB and a little spice of afrobeat. The artistes I admire are Khalid, 6lack, Alpha P and Rema. My music cannot be classified under a particular genre though I describe my sound as ‘afro-electro vibe’. “I always love to stand out from the crowd with my music, and that is why I experiment with various sounds to create something unique for my fans and lovers of good music.” The singer, who is currently a student of the Plateau State Polytechnic, also maintained that he had a lot in stock for his fans and other music lovers.
