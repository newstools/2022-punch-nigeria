A Rivers State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt has adjourned the criminal case against the Peoples Democratic Party governorship aspirant, Farah Dagogo, till May 25, 2022. Though no reason was given for the adjournment, Justice Chiwendu Nworgu was expected to deliver ruling on the motion argued in the last sitting by the lawyers in the matter. Dagogo was brought to court in a wheelchair by operatives of the Port Harcourt Correctional Centre. Dagogo, who is a serving member of the House of Representatives representing Degema-Bonny Federal Constituency, is facing two counts of cultism, conspiracy and possession of firearms. Recall that the governorship hopeful was arrested at the South-South PDP zonal secretariat in Port Harcourt when he showed up for screening by the zone’s governorship screening committee headed by Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri. Governor Nyesom Wike had declared Dagogo wanted on the grounds that he allegedly hired suspected cultism to disrupt screening of atate House of Assembly aspirants at the party’s state secretariat on Aba Road, Port Harcourt. The federal lawmaker, through his media aide, Ibrahim Lawal, had since denied the allegations, saying he was not at the secretariat during the protest.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
