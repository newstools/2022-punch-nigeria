Temi, an actress, model and daughter of billionaire businessman, Femi Otedola, has opened up on the reasons she accepted the marriage proposal of her singer lover, Oluwatosin Ajibade, aka Mr Eazi. Recall that on April 10, 2022, Otedola posted a video of the proposal, which took place in London. In a recent interview the actress had with Beat FM, she stated that she feels a sense of peace when with Mr Eazi. She said, “It is not something about him. It is just a feeling; a sense of peace I can’t feel with anyone else. It is a feeling like one has found one’s best friend and soulmate. I don’t know how to describe it. It is just like home.” Describing her engagement ring as ‘rocky’, Temi stated that before she starts planning her wedding, she wants to enjoy being engaged. She added, “I feel like before one starts planning for the wedding, one can just enjoy being engaged. That’s great. I miss my fiancé but it’s all good.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
