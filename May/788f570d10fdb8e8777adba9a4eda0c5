An Ondo State Magistrate’s Court sitting in Akure, the state capital, has ordered the remand of a woman, Omowale Olorunfemi, for allegedly killing her neighbour, Agatha Julius. The defendant was arrested by the police for allegedly killing the deceased after stabbing her during a fight on February 14, 2022, at Okeluse, in the Ose Local Government Area of the state. She was arraigned on two counts of murder. The prosecutor, Suleiman Abdulateef, told the court that the offence contravened sections 316 and 319 of the Criminal Code, Cap. 37, Vol. 1 Laws of Ondo State of Nigeria, 2006. He also prayed the court to remand the defendant in a custodial centre pending legal advice from the Directorate of Public Prosecutions. Counsel for the defendant, G.O. Bernard, did not oppose the remand application. The presiding magistrate, Mr Tope Aladejana, in his ruling, remanded the defendant pending advice from the DPP and adjourned the case till May 30, 2022. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
