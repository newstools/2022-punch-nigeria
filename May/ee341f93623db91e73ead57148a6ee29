He said, “I am the only aspirant that has eight years of experience in an executive arm of government, who has been in the private sector, and who has been the chairman of the National Assembly. “There is no other person with that kind of experience. Whether you are talking about executive experience, whether you are talking about restructuring which includes constitutional review and amendment, for somebody who has headed the parliament, or whether you are talking about uniting Nigerians, you know a national assembly is a place where you are first among equals. You must have the capacity to bring people together. “You will understand how business works so that people in business can invest.
