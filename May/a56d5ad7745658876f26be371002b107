The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board on Saturday released results of the just concluded 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination. The examination body, which also outlined the process to check the results, made this known in a statement signed by JAMB’s Head, Public Affairs and Protocol, Dr Fabian Benjamin, on Saturday in Abuja. It said, “To check the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination result, all a candidate needs to do is to simply send UTMERESULT to 55019 using the same phone number that he/she had used for registration and the result would be returned as a text message. “This is the only process of checking the 2022 UTME results for now as the board has not uploaded it on its website for obvious reasons. “In addition, candidates are forewarned that they would, as usual, receive all kinds of messages from desperate fraudsters on how to check their results different from the aforementioned one. Hence, the board urges all candidates to ignore all such messages on how to check their 2022 UTME results as they are all products of deceit aimed at misleading them. “The board, in line with its desire to adhere to the ease of doing business protocol of the government, has emplaced this user-friendly and simplified process of checking UTME results.” Copyright PUNCH.
