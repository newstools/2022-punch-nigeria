Cross River State Governor, Prof Ben Ayade, has directed his aides seeking elective offices to quit not later than Thursday (today). The governor has also directed permanent secretaries to assess all political appointees as he plans a minor cabinet reshuffle. He gave the order on Wednesday in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Christian Ita. The statement read, “The governor directed that any political appointee presently serving in his government but desires to seek elective position in the forthcoming 2023 elections is at liberty to do so. “He, however, added that such appointees should turn in their resignation on or before 12 noon, May 5, 2022; and such letters should be submitted to the Office of the Secretary to the State Government. Meanwhile, Ita disclosed that Ayade is set to reshuffle his cabinet. The statement read in part, “Governor Ben Ayade is set to carry out a major cabinet reshuffle in a bid to ensure that the administration indeed finishes strong as it enters the last lap of its lifespan.” Copyright PUNCH.
