The Indigenous People of Biafra has warned Apostle Johnson Suleman over what it described as “unprovoked verbal attack and ranting” against the group. The group said it was puzzling that a man of God would abandon his calling and resort to attacking them without any cause. In a statement on Tuesday, the group’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, cautioned Suleman and his likes to restrain from any comments on the IPOB or Igbo nation as that would not be tolerated anymore. The group said, “When have unguarded utterances against IPOB and the Igbo nation become part of Suleman’s calling? “We don’t intend to join issues with Suleman and his likes such as Tunde Bakare, but our message to them is very unambiguous: They should steer clear from any matter concerning the IPOB or the great Igbo race. Let them concentrate on their apostolic calling and restrain from unguarded utterances or vituperations on subjects beyond them. “We warn Apostle Suleman and his likes to restrain from any comments on the IPOB or Igbo nation as that will not be tolerated anymore. We don’t want to have issues with any man of God, and men of God should know their limits. “Men of God in the Bible days were never known for controversies.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
