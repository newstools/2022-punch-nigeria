A human rights lawyer, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), on Thursday, condemned as barbaric, the killing of Deborah Yakubu, a 200-level Home Economics student of Shehu Shagari College of Education in Sokoto, North-West Nigeria. The senior advocate, therefore, urged the Nigerian Bar Association, Section on Public Interest and Development Law, to cancel its forthcoming 2022 Annual Conference slated for May 22 to 26 in the North-West. According to Adegboruwa, in a statement, lawyers should not be seen dancing on the “grave” of the deceased student in Sokoto. Adegboruwa’s statement was titled, ‘The murder of Deborah in Sokoto’. He said, “I humbly urge NBA-SPIDEL not to hold any meeting or conference in the State where a Nigerian citizen has been brutally murdered and burnt to death. “It is barbaric and lawyers should not be seen to be dancing on her grave in that State. “We should make a statement to the government by canceling the Conference and hold it in a neighboring State in the North.” The female student was on Thursday mauled and burnt by a mob of Muslim youths who accused her of blasphemy on social media against Prophet Muhammad. The young lady’s killers posted videos of their action on social media attracting wild spread outrage and condemnation. The police in Sokoto said two suspects have been taken into custody in connection with the student’s killing. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
