The Ekiti State Government has nullified the purported installation of one Stephen Ajayi as the Obanla of Ipao Ekiti in the Ikole Local Government Area of the state. The Deputy Governor, Bisi Egbeyemi, who said that the purported installation was done contrary to the laws governing the nomination, selection and installation of Obas in the state, said the full wrath of the law would be enforced on those who performed the installation and the candidate who submitted himself for installation. Egbeyemi, according to a statement by his Special Assistant (Media), Odunayo Ogunmola, titled, ‘Ekiti nullifies illegal installation of Obanla of Ipao’ stated, “Since the purported installation is against the Ekiti State Chiefs Law, it is null and void and of no effect whatsoever. “The illegal installation of Ajayi as the Obanla of Ipao Ekiti was carried out on November 12, 2021 and again on May 18, 2022, making it the second time such an action was performed without the knowledge, consent and the permission of the state government.” “This government was put in place to uphold the law and it will not watch and allow some individuals to violate the law and throw any part of the state into chaos. It is no longer business as usual as the law will take care of the situation. All those involved in the illegal installation in Ipao Ekiti will be dealt with according to the law. “Ekiti State Chiefs Law frowns at the installation of an Oba without due process and the authority of the state government. The law stipulated punishment for anybody who installs an Oba without the authority of the state government and anybody who submits himself to be made an Oba illegally.”  Contact: theeditor@punchng.com Copyright PUNCH.
