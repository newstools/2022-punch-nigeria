The man-of-the-moment, Cyriel Dessers, continued his impressive form in the 2021/22 season with another tremendous performance as his brace helped Feyenoord come from two goals down to tie 2-2 against title-chasing PSV in their week 32 Eredivisie clash on Sunday. Dessers scored twice in the closing stages of the encounter at De Kuip to break PSV’s heart, who were cruising and closing the gap on league leaders Ajax. The 27-year-old striker grabbed his first goal in the 86th minute after Luis Sinisterra provided him with the assist. PSV’s hopes of fighting for the league title was extinguished after referee Serdar Gozubuyuk awarded Feyenoord a penalty deep into stoppage time. Dessers stepped up and converted the resultant spot kick, sending goalkeeper Yvon Mvogo the wrong way. The brace means the one-cap Nigeria international has now scored eight goals in the league and 20 across all competitions. The 20-goal landmark is the striker’s best output in topflight football, with his performance in the 2019/20 the closest, when he scored a total of 18 goals across all competitions. The striker’s best goal return was in the 2016/17 season when he scored a total of 29 goals in 40 games across all competitions in the second tier of the Dutch league with NAC Breda. Meanwhile, Dessers brace on Sunday against PSV means the striker has now reached a landmark of 100 goals in his entire career. During this time he played 246 matches and assisted another 37. Dessers is currently this season’s Europa Conference League top scorer with 10 goals from 12 matches and is on course to win his first European title when they face Roma in the final at the Arena Kombëtare in Tirana, Albania on May 25.
