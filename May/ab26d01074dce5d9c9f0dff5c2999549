Following the agreement reached between Governor Bello Mattawale and former Governor Abdul Aziz Yari, there are strong indications that two Senators, three National Assembly members, and 10 State Assembly members will not contest the 2023 general election. A source who wanted to remain anonymous told The PUNCH that two Senators, three National and 10 State Assembly members, have already filled their forms to contest in the forthcoming 2023 general election. “They will, however, be replaced with other candidates loyal to former Governor Abdul Aziz Yari,” said the source. The source further explained that a meeting with Yari’s political associates would be convened in Abuja on Wednesday to nominate those filling the nomination forms to contest the reserved positions. “You know that both the present and the former governor have signed a consensus agreement form where elective positions were shared between the duo. “In the agreement form, it was agreed that Governor Bello Mattawale will take the position of a Deputy Governor, one Senator, four House of Representatives members, and 14 House of Assembly members. “The former Governor Abdul Aziz Yari was given two Senatorial seats, three federal lawmakers and 10 House of Assembly members,” the source stated. The source added that former Governor Yari would contest for Zamfara West Senatorial Zone. At the same time, his colleague, Senator Kabiru Mafara, would go for the Zamfara Central Senatorial zone.
