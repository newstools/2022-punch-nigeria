Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has disclosed that the state government has approved the recruitment of 350 persons into the State Security Network Agency also known as Amotekun corps. Akeredolu also said the government would procure more operational vehicles and motorcycles to aid the operation of the corps in the state. The governor made the announcement at an award programme organised by Ondo State Agribusiness Empowerment Centre in Akure. According to Akeredolu, the recruitment became imperative as the corps had been overstretched while protecting farmers in the bush and performing other security services in the state. He said, “We have agreed to employ 350 personnel into the Amotekun Corps in the state because of the pressure on Amotekun. “Operational vehicles and motorcycles will be purchased to ease their work.” The governor, who noted that there was a time agricultural investors were leaving the state until the advent of Amotekun, said there would soon be Amotekun operatives present in the rural areas.
