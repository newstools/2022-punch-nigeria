Former Governor of Anambra State and presidential hopeful, Peter Obi, has said Nigeria must transit from a consuming to a producing nation to pull her citizens out of poverty. The Peoples Democratic Party presidential hopeful said the country must live within its means by cutting down on the cost of governance and investing in human capital development. Obi stated this while answering questions from newsmen shortly after a consultative meeting with the party’s stakeholders in Port Harcourt, Rivers State on Monday. He said pulling Nigerians out of poverty was a sine qua-non ,saying that with the abundant resources in the country, it is unacceptable to have youths without means of livelihood. Obi said delegates all over Nigeria must look at the way the country is today and ask how do we build a better place as they vote to choose party candidates to contest the 2023 general elections. “I am saying the same thing to Nigerians for the general elections. We must live within our means in this country. That is what we need to do urgently to take our people out of poverty,” Obi said. He added, “So we cannot allow our young people in their young age with the resources of this country to be living where they have no means of livelihood. That is what I want to do. “That is why I said my basic function is to move the country from consumption to production. We have to change. No more sharing formular. “I’m going to put the production formula in place. We must feed ourselves. We have enough land all over Nigeria for us to feed ourselves.” Copyright PUNCH.
