Former Super Falcons captain, Desire Oparanozie, returned to action for the first time in five weeks in Wuhan Jianghan University FC 3-2 win over Shanghai Shengli in the Chinese Women’s Super League on Saturday. Oparanozie made a cameo appearance in the game coming on in the 86th minute. Despite featuring for just four minutes, the 28-year-old is delighted with getting a few competitive times under her belt as she targets a starting role against Jiangsu Suning on Wednesday. “Happy to have gotten my first minutes after five long weeks of fitness battle,” Oparanozie tweeted after the win. Wuhan Jianghan are currently top of the Chinese Women League with 21 points from seven games this season. The Nigeria international joined the Chinese side in March after spending eight years in the French Women’s League with Guingamp between 2014 and 2020 and Dijon from 2020 to 2022. Oparanozie’s return to fitness will also be a huge boost for Super Falcons coach Randy Waldrum ahead of the 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Morocco. The coach had earlier been boosted by the return of forward Asisat Oshoala from a 10-week injury. The Falcons will face South Africa, Burundi and Botswana in Group C of the competition with hopes of finishing amongst the top four countries in the tournament which automatically qualifies them for the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.
