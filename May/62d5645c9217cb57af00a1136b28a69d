Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission have arrested an outdoor advertisement executive over political advertisements that appeared on two billboards in Enugu State capital bearing the name and logo of the commission. It was gathered the arrest was carried out on Saturday by operatives in the Enugu zonal office of the commission. The two billboards located at Otigba and Zik Avenue junctions in Enugu, contained offensive messages using the name of the EFCC to threaten the aspiration of some politicians in the state in the build-up to the 2023 general elections. Our correspondent who visited the scenes on Sunday reported that the billboards had been dismantled by the anti-graft agency. The message on the billboard read “Warning 2022: Enugu PDP learn from 2007 election. EFCC is coming with Koboko on corrupt candidate”. It was, however, further gathered that the message on the billboards which were mounted in the heart of the state capital and well situated may have angered some front-runner aspirants for the office of the governor in 2023.
