Former Imo Governor Senator Rochas Okorocha is at Federal High Court in Abuja for arraignment on charges of money laundering and related offences. He was brought to court by officials of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The PUNCH had reported that Okorocha was forcefully arrested in his Abuja home last Tuesday. The serving senator and presidential aspirant under the All Progressives Congress was said to allegedly fail to honour EFCC’s invitation. EFCC had filed 17 charges against him and the senator is expected to be arraigned before Justice Inyang Ekwo. Okorocha, who is the first defendant, is being arraigned alongside Anyim Nyerere Chinenye, Naphtali International Limited, Perfect Finish Multi Projects Limited, Consolid Projects Consulting Limited, Pramif International Limited, and Legend World Concepts Limited as second to seventh defendants respectively before Justice Inyang Ekwo. Okorocha, through his lawyer, Ola Olanipekun, SAN, had on Friday approached the court on liberal terms but the request was turned down by the court. He was alleged to have laundered funds to the tune of N2.9 billion while serving as governor of Imo. They are currently taking their plea at the time of writing this report. Copyright PUNCH.
