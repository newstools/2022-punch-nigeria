Bundesliga giants Borussia Dortmund are the latest side to show interest as the race for the signing of Nigeria international, Calvin Bassey, heats up. The Rangers star has grown to become one of the most sought-after players in Europe following his impressive 2021/22 season with the Scottish giants. In the just-concluded season, the Super Eagles defender made a total of 49 appearances, a testament to his importance to the club. A host of English Premier League clubs have been linked with the player ahead of next transfer window with Crystal Palace, Aston Villa, Chelsea and Newcastle all interested in the 22-year-old defender. Bassey, who has been making the headlines in the past few weeks for the right reasons, has also been linked with a move to Bayern Munich as a possible replacement for Sule who departs the club for Dortmund. Meanwhile, according to a respected transfer insider Lahcen Senhaji, Dortmund have shown interest in the Nigerian with several of their key players expected to leave the club in the summer. “After rejecting a £3.5m offer from Fulham for Calvin Bassey, Rangers may accept the new £9m,” he wrote on Twitter. “Borussia Dortmund are also interested but no concrete offer yet.” However, if the Eagles star is to leave Rangers any time soon, it is going to cost a hefty sum with the Light Blues holding out for a Scottish record fee in excess of £25m. Dortmund finished second last term, eight points behind league champions Bayern Munich, but the BVB are eager to rebuild the squad ahead of the 2022/23 season.
