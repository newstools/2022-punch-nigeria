Politicians from different political backgrounds as well as elder statesmen and captains of industries converged on Oguta town in the Oguta Local Government Area of Imo State on Saturday to bid farewell to late maverick politician, Authur Nzeribe. The governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodimma, said that the country lost a “great son.” Uzodimma described Nzeribe as “a common denominator who created a platform to gather the current crop of politicians within and outside the state”. The governor said that the political activities of Nzeribe were “legendary”. Uzodimma said, “The late Senator Nzeribe remain a great man who properly defined Nigeria’s political space. The country’s political lexicon will be incomplete without the mention of Senator Arthur Nzeribe.” The immediate past Governor of Imo State, Emeka Ihedioha, described the late lawmaker as “a great politician who came, saw and conquered”. Elder statesman, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, said that Nzeribe was visible in the Nigerian political space for many years and would be remembered for his services to the nation. A former governor of Imo State, Ikedi Ohakim; the Senate minority leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe; immediate past Deputy Governor of Imo State, Gerald Ironah; members of the Imo State cabinet, lawmakers, business moguls and others were in attendance during the funeral rites.
