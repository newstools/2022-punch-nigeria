The Federal Capital Territory Police Command has assured Abuja residents of their safety after restoring order at Same Global Estate, in the Lokogoma area of Abuja that was earlier attacked by ravaging commercial motorcyclists. The PUNCH had reported that earlier today the Okada riders set some buildings on fire over their colleagues’ death. In a statement signed by the FCT Command’s Public Relations Officers, Josephine Adeh, the police said the Commissioner of Police, Babaji Sunday, assured residents of the Command’s dedication to the safety of lives and property within the FCT. The statement partly read, “The FCT Commissioner of Police, Babaji Sunday, was on the ground with a heavy deployment of operatives for an on-the-spot assessment concerning the incident that took place at Same Global Estate. “The unrest followed a hit-and-run fatal motor and motorcycle accident that occurred around Same Global Estate, Dakwo, Galadimawa, at about 01:30 pm today being May 29, 2022, the Command assures residents that normalcy has been restored to the affected area. “The CP assures residents of the Command’s dedication to the safety of lives and property within the FCT under his watch while urging well-meaning members of the public to remain calm and go about their lawful businesses without the fear of harassment and molestation of any kind from any quarters, to remain vigilant and report any suspicious or abnormal occurrence to the Police.” Copyright PUNCH.
