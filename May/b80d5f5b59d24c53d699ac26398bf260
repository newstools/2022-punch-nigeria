The N23.3bn fraud case involving a former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki, on Monday started afresh nearly seven years after he was first arraigned. Dasuki was first arraigned on December 14, 2015 before Justice Peter Affen of the Federal Capital Territory High Court but he was later elevated to the Court of Appeal, forcing the trial to begin afresh. The case was subsequently re-assigned to Justice Baba Yusuf. However, it was learnt that after Justice Yusuf was appointed as the Chief Judge of the FCT, he again assigned the case to Justice Yusuf Halilu. On Monday, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission arraigned Dasuki along with a former Sokoto State Governor, Attahiru Bafarawa; his son Sagir Bafarawa; their company, Dalhatu Investment Limited; and a former Minister of State for Finance, Bashir Yuguda, on corruption charges. They were re-arraigned on allegations of breach of trust and criminal misappropriation of public funds amounting to N23.3bn The EFCC, which slammed 25 counts against Dasuki, Bafarawa and Yuguda, accused them of diverting various sums in various currencies to different bank accounts under the false pretence of using the funds for the procurement of security equipment. When the charges were read to them, all the accused persons pleaded not guilty. The trial of Dasuki follows an investigation by the EFCC into allegations that he diverted $2.1bn meant from the purchase of arms. The former NSA, however, applied for permission from the court to travel overseas for medical reasons, a move which was opposed by the Prosecution lawyer, Leke Atolagbe. Justice Halilu subsequently adjourned the matter till June 7.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
