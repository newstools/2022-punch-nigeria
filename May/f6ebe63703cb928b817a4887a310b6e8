The infighting between the immediate Governor of Imo State, Emeka Ihedioha, and the National Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, Samuel Anyanwu, has compelled the Imo state chapter of the PDP to suspend its primaries indefinitely. While Ihedioha is publicly supporting the presidential ambition of the Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, Anyanwu, is said to be supporting his longtime friend and political benefactor, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State. PDP in a statement issued on Saturday by its Organising Secretary in the state, Law Biaduo, announced that Sunday’s planned primaries would no longer hold. The party said that a new date for the suspended primaries would be announced, urging the party faithful to remain calm. The statement read, “Notice is hereby given that the planned PDP Primary Elections for State Houses of Assembly and Federal Houses of Representatives earlier scheduled for Sunday, 22nd May, 2022 are hereby postponed. “A new date and further directives regarding these elections shall be communicated to all concerned as soon as possible. “All members of our great party are advised to remain calm.” Copyright PUNCH.
