Some bandits on Tuesday abducted students and travellers along the Birnin Gwari highway, in Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State. It was learnt that the hoodlums also burnt eight vehicles in which the students were travelling to participate in the examination for the School of Health Technology, in Makarfi, scheduled to hold at the Kaduna State University in the metropolis. The Public Relations Officer of the Birnin Gwari Emirate Progressive Union, Idris Saidu, who stated this in a statement, said the bandits laid siege on three different locations on the highway, forcing motorists to make u-turn. According to the spokesman, those who were not lucky fell into the trap set by the bandits and were subsequently abducted. The statement read, “Scores of travellers and students who were to write examinations for admission into school of Health, Makarfi affiliated to the Kaduna State University were abducted. “One of our officials, Abubakar Babajo, escaped. He said eight vehicles were set ablaze by the bandits after abducting all the passengers and they were able to escape by Allah’s will.” BEPU therefore advised intending travellers to either suspend their journey or use other alternative routes “as large number of bandits are currently stationed on the road at about three different locations. “This advice should not be taken for granted for security of lives and properties of our people. “Due to the blockage of the road, some of our students who are to attend entrance exams at School of Health, in Makarfi this morning could not make it, while some of them have been abducted. “Through the intervention of Malam Mu’azu Idris, the school authority has agreed to reschedule the examination.”  Copyright PUNCH.
