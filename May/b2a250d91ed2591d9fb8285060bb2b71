Mr Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, Special Adviser on Civic Engagement to Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has assured the electorate that his principal would not disappoint them if he is re-elected in July 16 governorship election. Oyintiloye also said Oyetola has justified the mandate given to him in 2018, saying people could attest to the various developmental projects that he embarked on since coming on board. The governor’s aide made the disclosure during an engagement programme organised by the Civic Engagement Office and members of the Traders Association of Nigeria, Osun Chapter, in Osogbo on Thursday. Oyintiloye, who represented Oyetola at the meeting added that the governor would not relax but work more for the development of the state and the welfare of his people when elected for another term. He said, “Oyetola will not let the people of the state down, if re-elected in July 16 governorship election in the state. “People of the state, who elected him in 2018, could attest to the various developmental projects he embarked on in the last three and a half years of his administration. “Oyetola’s campaign for re-election is not out of desperation, but it is rather aimed at the continuation of the good works he had started.” He, therefore, appealed to those who were yet to collect their Permanent Voter Cards to hasten up ahead of the governorship poll.
