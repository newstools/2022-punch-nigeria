Nine lawmakers of the People Democratic Party in the Kano State House of Assembly have defected to the New Nigeria People’s Party to which their leader and former governor Rabiu Kwankwanso had earlier joined. The Public Relations Officer of the Assembly, Uba Abdullahi, announced the defection of the lawmakers in a statement on Friday. He said the lawmakers had sent a letter to the Speaker of the State Assembly notifying the House of their defection. He said some of the reasons given by the lawmakers bordered on leadership tussle in the PDP both at state and national levels. The defected members are Isyaku Ali Danja (Gezawa Constituency), Umar Musa Gama (Nassarawa Constituency), Aminu Sa’adu Ungogo (Ungogo Constituency), Lawan Hussain Chediyar ‘Yan Gurasa (Dala Constituency) and Tukur Muhammad (Fagge Constituency). Others are Mu’azzam El-Yakub (Dawakin Kudu Constituency), Garba Shehu Fammar (Kibiya Constituency), Abubakar Uba Galadima (Bebeji Constituency) and Mudassir Ibrahim Zawaciki (Kumbotso Constituency). Recall that on April, 29 2022, the House announced the defection of the member representing Kano Municipal, Salisu Gwangwazo, from the PDP to the All Progressives Congress due to internal crisis in the party.
