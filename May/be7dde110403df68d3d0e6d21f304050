A Federal High Court sitting in Ilorin, Kwara State, on Monday, convicted and sentenced three men to various jail terms for offences bordering on cybercrime. The convicts are Pelumi Omoniyi, Oluwadamilola Faloye and Lukman Olanipekun. The Ilorin Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission prosecuted the culprits on separate charges. They were convicted by Justice Muhammed Sani after they pleaded guilty to their respective charges. The prosecution counsel, Innocent Mbachie and Andrew Akoja, urged the court to consider the extra-judicial statements of the defendants and all the exhibits tendered. Justice Sani said the prosecution proved the cases beyond reasonable doubt. The judge sentenced Omoniyi to one-year imprisonment with a fine option of N200,000. The judge ordered that one iPhone 11 promax and the sum of $110, which were proceeds of his unlawful activities, be forfeited to the Federal Government. The court also ordered the convict to restitute £250 to the Federal Government. Justice Sani also sentenced Faloye to one-year imprisonment with a fine option of N200,000, and ordered that one Samsung Galaxy S10, a iPhone 13, and a MacBook laptop, which were used to perpetrate the crime be forfeited to the Federal Government. The court also ordered the convict to restitute $1,108, which he benefited from the proceeds of crime. Similarly, Olanipekun bagged one-year imprisonment with a fine option of N200,000.
