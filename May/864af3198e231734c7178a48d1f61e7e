The Prelate of the Methodist Church Nigeria, Dr Samuel Chukwuemeka-Uche, has joined other Nigerians to condemn the gruesome killing of Deborah Samuel, a 200-level student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto. The cleric called on the National Assembly to promulgate a bill that will put paid to the barbaric killing on religious basis. He made this known at a news conference during his Apostolic/Valedictory tour of the Archdiocese at Wesley Chapel, Lekki, Lagos, after a brief church service on Friday. The cleric, who expressed serious concern over the present state of the nation, said, “I blame Christians at the National Assembly. They are not representing Christians well. They should promulgate a bill that nobody should be killed on a religious basis. If the president signs it, then it would become law.” He said there was a need to shun ethnicity, tribalism, and religious extremism, adding that the Methodist Church had always preached love and egalitarianism. According to him, killing in the name of religion is a crude and uncivilised lifestyle, stressing that ‘we should promote love and harmony among ourselves.’ He also condemned those calling for “a particular tribe” to leave the country, insisting that, “we are Nigerians and we shall remain here.” He advised the electorate to cast their votes wisely for candidates of their choice in the forthcoming 2023 general elections.
