Residents of Onikainkain at Moniya, Akinyele Local Government Area of Oyo State, have lamented over the poor state of roads, which continually gets worsened by floods in the area. The PUNCH gathered that the recent rainfall in Ibadan left a bridge in the area covered up by flood, with pedestrians particularly stranded, while vehicle users risked maneuvering through the water. One of the residents, who spoke to our correspondent, noted that the situation had persisted for a very long time with the government not doing anything about it. The rainfall that occurred on May 16 and 21 had reportedly worsened the situation. The people “have no option but to pass on the wretched bridge with their shoes and sandals off. “We lack all government amenities in the area. We don’t have motorable roads. Okada riders are avoiding our community now.
“For almost a month now, we have no power supply,” a resident, Busari Usman, told The PUNCH. The residents called on the public for rescue “as our area is under siege of the flood.” Below are some of the pictures of the flooded area:  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
