Over a month after the Super Eagles failed to qualify for the Qatar 2022 World Cup, Emmanuel Amuneke, ex-assistant coach of the team says he is yet to overcome the trauma of missing from football’s showpiece event in Asia, The PUNCH reports. The Eagles played Ghana in the final round of the play-offs but lost 1-1 on aggregate on the away goal rule to miss out of the competition for the first time in 16 years. Speaking with The PUNCH, Amuneke said, “When it comes to football, I’m passionate about it and equally passionate about my job. “I pray I’m in position to bring back the smile to the faces of Nigerians because we are all sad missing the World Cup. There will always be better days, but we just need to learn from the previous lesson and see how we can do better. “I am still hurt that we failed to qualify and those that know me knows that I’m really hurt because of the love I have for the game, hurt because of the love I have for Nigerians because they guided me to become who and what I am today. It will be wrong not to be empathetic when they are going through pain.” The Atlanta ‘’96 gold medallist added that he would not shy away from responsibilities if called upon to serve the country in the future. “If tomorrow my country needs me, I will be there and try to correct the mistakes that we made in the past. I will always be ready and available.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
