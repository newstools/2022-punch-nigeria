As part of its renewed commitment toward clamping down on unethical real estate development practices, the Lagos State Government says it has demolished a three-storey building in the Ebute-Metta area of the state. This was contained in a statement on the official social media handle of the Lagos Building Control Agency on Tuesday. The statement, which urged real estate developers to build in line with the laid down laws of the State, said the demolition was part of an ongoing exercise to rid the State of distressed structures. It read in part, “In continuation of the ongoing demolition exercise of highly distressed structures across the State, LASBCA today, pulled down a three-floor structure at 3, Jebba Street, off Borno Way, Ebute-Metta (East).” The demolition followed recent incidents of building collapse in the Ebute-Metta and Okota areas of the state. The PUNCH had reported earlier how LASBCA on Saturday, pulled down the remains of a three-story building that partially collapsed along Chris Ngadi Avenue, Ago Palace Way, Okota. The Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr Idris Salako, in reaction to the incident, had said that the government was carrying out thorough scrutiny into the causes of the building collapse. He also said the state government was putting several far-reaching measures in place to reform the regulatory environment. In 2022, Lagos State has recorded three incidents of building collapse across the Yaba, Ebute-Metta and Okota areas of the State, with 15 lives lost in two separate events. Copyright PUNCH.
