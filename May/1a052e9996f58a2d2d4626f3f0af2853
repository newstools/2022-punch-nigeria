The Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr Fola Shonubi, and the Chief Executive Officer, Sifax Group, Dr Taiwo Afolabi, are among the dignitaries expected at the forthcoming youth empowerment and award programme of the Ijebu Youth Association. In a statement on Thursday, the National President of the group, Okikiola Fayomi, said that the programme, billed for next week in Ijebu Ode, Ogun State, is expected to be attended by over 2000 youths. According to Fayomi, over 200 youths have been penciled down to benefit from the various empowerment tools such as sewing machines, hair dryers, make-up kits, and barbing kits, among others. He explained that the provision of the empowerment tools which were sourced from some public-spirited Nigerians was an initiative devised to help fight joblessness among the youths. The statement read in part, “The youth group has also spotted some deserving Nigerians to be honoured on that day for their invaluable contributions towards advancing youth development and empowerment in the country” “Other eminent Nigerians also expected at the events include, the wife of the governor of Ogun State, Mrs Bamidele Abiodun; Chief Medical Director, Federal Medical Centre Abeokute, Prof Musa-Olomu; Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Ogun State, Dr. Halimat T.
