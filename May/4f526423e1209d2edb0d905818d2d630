Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has admonished Muslims in the state to take advantage of the Eid celebration and offer prayers for the peace and development of the state, especially as it prepares for the forthcoming elections. Oyetola also admonished them not to forget the significance of Ramadan and charged them to carry on with its numerous lessons and virtues. Oyetola, in a Sallah Message released by his Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan, prayed Allah to accept all acts of worship and supplications of the Muslim faithful during the just-concluded fasting month. The statement read, “I also pray Allah accepts all our ibadaah (acts of worship) and supplications in the month of Ramadan. “I enjoin us not to forget the significance of the holy and spiritually-rejuvenating month, and carry on with its numerous lessons and virtues that it has come to teach and remind us. Let us continue to demonstrate the lessons of Ramadan in our daily activities and dealings with others. “As we celebrate the Eid with our family and loved ones, let us remember to extend love and compassion to the needy and less privileged in society. As we give with humility, Allah will reward us and multiply in abundance whatever we spend in charity. “Muslims in Osun and indeed all people of the State should take advantage of this important celebration to offer prayers for the peace, stability, progress and development of the State, especially as it prepares for the forthcoming elections.” Copyright PUNCH.
