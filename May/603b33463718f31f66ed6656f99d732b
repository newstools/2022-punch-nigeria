The National Association of University Students, Osun State Chapter, on Monday, petitioned the governor of the state, Gboyega Oyetola, over the harassment of some students of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife on Saturday by the Amotekun security outfit in the state. The PUNCH had reported on Monday that NAUS had accused some officials of Amotekun of assaulting and extorting three students, which the security outfit denied. The petition to the governor, made available to The PUNCH on Tuesday, read in part, “The above-named association is writing this appeal to bring to your notice an arbitrary perpetuation of undue brutality and assault on some students of Obafemi Awolowo University by certain security personnel identified as the Amotekun Squad on April 30, 2022, around 3 am. They were callously battered and extorted financially. “This was committed during a process of stop and search routine along Mayfair area which was induced by a proclaimed armed robbery within the vicinity. Though the routine is recognisable as a means of ensuring the safety of the habitant of the allegedly attacked neighborhood, we consider this approach inhumane and patently unethical. “Hence, we call on your authority to look into this matter and take necessary sanctions with a high level of alacrity. This is yet another situation to prove the trustworthiness of your authority to the entirety of Nigerian students. “We demand an Official Response Within 24-48 hours as every conscious student is Waiting for our leadership to take immediate steps.” The student body said it hoped not to be disappointed.
