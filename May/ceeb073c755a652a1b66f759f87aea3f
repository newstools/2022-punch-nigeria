The senator representing Ogun East Senatorial District, Lekan Mustapha, and hundreds of his supporters have joined the Governor Dapo Abiodun faction of the Ogun State All Progressives Congress. Mustapha and his supporters were before now allies of former governor Ibikunle Amosun. Receiving the senator and his teeming supporters at the Presidential Lodge, Abeokuta, Abiodun commended them for retracing their steps and reuniting to the mainstream, saying their return would strengthen the party to face the challenges ahead. “I am very happy that this is coming from my home base. If I did not have the trust of my people, then I would not have that of other senatorial districts. It is heart-warming that today we are reconciling with my people. We all have opportunity to examine this administration and I am happy you have decided to have a rethink and come for reconciliation.” The governor described Mustapha as a principled individual with impeccable character and integrity who demonstrated uncommon courage when his integrity was tested. Earlier, the state chairman of the party, Yemi Sanusi, recalled the circumstance that led to the breakaway which he said was not pleasant to many, describing the return of party members as a joyous occasion. In his remarks, Mustapha commended the governor for spreading projects to all sections of the state, declaring that his senatorial district had benefited from various road projects of the present administration more than previous ones in the last 16 years.
