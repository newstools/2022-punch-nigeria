Elder statesman and former Governor of old Anambra State, Senator Jim Nwobodo, Tuesday, endorsed Mr Peter Mbah as the person to succeed Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi. This came after months of speculations on who will take over from Ugwuanyi in 2023. Nwobodo said the endorsement was a product of a series of consultations. He said, “From my interaction with a number of them, I was looking for somebody whom I think should redevelop Enugu State. “As far back as October 2019, I invited Peter Mbah to my house. When he came, I told him to consider running for a position, especially Governor. He didn’t give me an answer immediately, but later he came and said he would consider running. “Tomorrow, people will ask why am I keeping quiet, this is why I’m addressing the media today. I believe anybody who wins the primary tomorrow will be the Governor because the PDP is the only party in Enugu State. “I have also been speaking with the Governor of the State, a fine, peaceful gentleman and I told him that anybody who will succeed must bring peace. “We need a Governor who will not go into any war, rascality or vandalism but peace. Anybody who wants to be the Governor must follow the same path. “I have heard all kinds of rumours about people claiming they are sponsoring Peter Mbah, but he knows that I brought him into this race.”
