Nigerian music producer, Samuel Oguachuba alias Samklef, has slammed fans of Wizkid for their “disrespect” despite his role in the singer’s career. Samklef fired at the fan base, popularly referred to as Wizkid FC, via a series of tweets on Saturday. Posting a picture of Wizkid’s debut album, Superstar (on which he worked on as a producer), Samklef stated that Wizkid’s success was based on the “foundation” he laid for the artiste before his rise to global stardom. “Dear Wizkid FC, insulting me is like insulting Wizkid o! Na on top my foundation he use stand. So think before you do. Do your research,” he wrote in pidgin. “My work is one of the best albums out of Nigeria. The birth of your favourite. Don’t disrespect me. You won’t like it. Make a U-turn FC. I gave your favourite his first-ever 1 million naira show. Don’t disrespect me, Wizkid FC.” Samklef’s Twitter outburst follows his previous outcry as regards alleged unpaid royalties on Wizkid’s 2011 hit song, Pakurumo. On an Instagram live video last week, Samklef demanded his royalties from EME label boss, Banky W, over his contribution to the song, which was recorded under the label. In response, Banky W asked Samklef to take his demands to Wizkid, and his new record label, Sony Music. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
