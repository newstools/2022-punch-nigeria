A group known as Organisation for Global Youth’s Peace Empowerment and Development Initiative has advised the Vice President, Prof Yemi Osibanjo, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, Minister of State for Education, Mr Emeka Nwajiuba and other aspirants who are key members of the Buhari administration to immediately abort their presidential ambitions. The group made the call on Saturday in a statement by its National Coordinator, Mr Japhet Omene, in Asaba, Delta State. He said, “Nigeria has been critically wounded by this administration. The inability of the Buhari administration to salvage the key challenges facing the country, ranging from insecurity, corruption, unemployment, and others, is alarming and embarrassing. And as such, we do not think it is proper for any key member of this administration to become the next President of Nigeria. ‘‘ Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
