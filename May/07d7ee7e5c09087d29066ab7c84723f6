Interior solutions provider, the Black Pelican Group, says it recently celebrated 18 years of providing interior solutions to the real estate industry. According to a statement by the BPG, trading under 3 trade names (IL Bagno, Bathrooms Direct and Technogym), the company is known and celebrated by clients for high quality bathroom fittings, kitchens, doors, furniture, lighting, tiles and gym equipment. Speaking on the milestone achievement, BPG CEO, Michael Owolabi, said, “We are elated to celebrate the company’s growth trajectory and market leadership over the last 18 years. We saw the gap in the market and started out with the aim of providing high quality bathroom solutions and over time morphed into a more robust solutions provider as the needs of our clients demanded. Today we are the destination of choice for the most discerning clients. Our success is due in no small measure to our people. “Our Technogym business has in the last four years made giant strides in promoting a total wellness revolution through both the supply of premium wellness equipment and by embodying the wellness lifestyle.” The statement added that through its corporate social responsibility initiative to promote hygiene and end open defecation, Black Pelican Limited has donated toilets to numerous schools and organizations such as the Nigerian Red cross society,  Ikoyi Club, University of Lagos, Motherless Babies’ home and a handful of Primary and tertiary Institutions amongst others. The organisation is also collaborating with the Water Aid foundation to ensure that the initiative is sustained, the statement said. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
