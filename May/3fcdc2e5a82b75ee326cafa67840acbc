The Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room in a statement jointly signed by its convener, Ene Obi, and co-conveners, Asmau Joda and James Ugochukwu, on Monday, criticised the decision of the Independent National Electoral Commission to extend the primaries for political parties. The group also warned the electoral commission to avoid future occurrence. The PUNCH had earlier reported that INEC had on Friday, May 28, 2022 announced the extension of the deadline for party primaries after immense pressure. Following the extension, the ruling All Progressives Congress announced the postponement of its presidential primaries. “The situation room is disappointed that INEC backtracked on its insistence of not extending the deadline for political parties to conclude their primaries and submit a list of candidates for the 2023 general elections.” “INEC’s insistence on its earlier timetable compelled some of the parties to proceed with the given dates, despite the flaws in their process. Turning around and extending the date meant that political parties that were lagging behind their preparations for the parties have now been gifted with the advantage of better preparation that the earlier given date denied other political parties. “INEC should be seen to level the playing field for all parties involved in any election. The situation room is concerned that INEC’s action in shifting deadlines and schedules for the election may be interpreted as a show of bias – a perception that does not help in building a reputation of impartial umpire ahead of the 2023 general elections. “The situation room calls on INEC to refrain from any future action that may intensify perceptions of bias or unfairness as we head to the general elections in 2023.”  Contact: theeditor@punchng.com Copyright PUNCH.
