The Peoples Democratic Party presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, on Monday, met with former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, in Abuja. In a tweet posted to his official Twitter page, @atiku, on Monday, the Waziri Adamawa said the purpose of the meeting was to “unify our country Nigeria.”  Atiku wrote, “To unify our country Nigeria, we have to start with bringing every member of the @OfficialPDPNig under the covering of the umbrella. My visit to @bukolasaraki not long ago underscores this commitment. More to follow. -AA.” Atiku had defeated Saraki and others at the party’s presidential primary in Abuja on Saturday night. The meeting was also attended by a former senator representing the Kogi West Senatorial District, Dino Melaye.  The PUNCH reports that during the PDP presidential primary held at the MKO International Stadium, Abuja, on Saturday, Atiku polled 371 votes to defeat Wike, who got 237 votes; a former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, 70 votes; the Akwa Ibom State Governor, Emmanuel Udom, 38 votes; the Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, 20 votes; a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim, 14 votes and an ex-President of Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, Sam Ohuabunwa, one vote. The PUNCH had earlier reported that delegates were surprised when the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, who was one of the front runners for the presidential ticket, stepped down and directed his supporters to vote for Atiku as a result of what sources said was due to the intervention of the northern elders, who were pushing for a northern consensus aspirant.
