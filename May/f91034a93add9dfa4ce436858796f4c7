An international human rights organisation, Centre for Democracy and Development, said at least 60,000 people have been killed in 18 Northern states of Nigeria in the last 10 years due to insecurity. The CDD in its report titled; “Multiple Nodes, Common Cause: National Stock take of contemporary insecurity and state responses in Nigeria,” said in the North Western states of Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara ,about 14, 000 people lost their lives between 2011 and 2021. A statement issued on Tuesday night by the Director of CDD, Idayat Hassan, said the report, which also measured conflict related casualties in the North Central states of Federal Capital Territory, Kogi, Kwara, Nasarawa, Niger and Plateau, revealed that “around 11, 000 people were killed in the period under review.” According to the report, about 35, 000 people were killed in North East states of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Taraba and Yobe. While tracing similar development and casualties across other geo-political zones, CDD said similar development continued to fuel the ugly situation, especially, lack of education, absence of state actors, economic war, security forces, cultism, land use dispute, ethnicity, religion, failure of justice system, overstretched security forces and others. In the South-South region of the country, sea piracy and robbery remained key concerns as illegal bunkering, political violence, herders/farmer clashes, oil spill, cultism, marginalisation, human trafficking, ritual killing are said to be fueling violence and insecurity.
