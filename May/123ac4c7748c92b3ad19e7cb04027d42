There was confusion over a Peoples Democratic Party banner erected at Ikot Ekpene Township Stadium, Akwa Ibom, which is the venue of the ongoing declaration by the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio. The banner with the caption “Peoples Democratic Party, Akwa Ibom State Chapter in support of His Excellency, Chief Dr Godswill Akpabio for President in 2023” stood among other APC banners at the venue. The development threw members of the political class into confusion as the leader of the party and Governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel, is also contesting as President in 2023 under PDP. Giving reasons for the action, a man who claimed to be a member of PDP at the venue told our correspondent that the action was taken because the Governor failed to consult the party in the state before embarking on such a significant contest. “Charity must always begin at home. How can our Governor be going around the country to consult for a presidential election without first of all informing Akwa Ibom people?” he queried. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
