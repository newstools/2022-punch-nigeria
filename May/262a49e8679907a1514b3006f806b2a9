Manchester United secured Europa League qualification despite losing 1-0 at Crystal Palace on the final day of the season with new manager Erik ten Hag watching on from the stands. West Ham’s 3-1 defeat at Brighton ensured United secured a sixth-place finish to swerve playing in next season’s Europa Conference League. Wilfried Zaha fired Palace scored what proved to be the winner after 37 minutes as United produced a lacklustre display in interim manager Ralf Rangnick’s final game in charge. Copyright PUNCH.
