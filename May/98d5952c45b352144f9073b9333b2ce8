See the #HeadiesNominees again.” Another fan, @ada_meewah, said, “Wizkid is tired of awards, he is getting nominated every three market days. #HeadiesNominees #Headies2022” Knocking critics, @philosophierol4 said, “Calling Wizkid local champion because he was nominated nine times in the Headies award is the most forced savage. “Wizkid has more international awards recognition than all your favourites combined.” “So Headies wants to hand over 9 awards to Wizkid 🐐 in one night? GOAT (Greatest of all times) level,” @sir_momoraji tweeted. Another singer who raked in multiple nominations was Mavin Record’s Ayra Starr. The forthcoming award ceremony, set to hold in the United States, had in its nomination list, some first timers like Portable, Magixx, and other fast-rising artistes. Copyright PUNCH.
