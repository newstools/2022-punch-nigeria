Gateway coach, Toyin Ayinla, has praised his goalkeeper Ibukun Araromi heroics after he helped his side earn a hard-fought 1-1 draw away to Ibom Youth in a Nigerian National League game on Saturday at Ikot Ikpene Township Stadium, Akwa Ibom. Araromi produced outstanding saves in the encounter and saved a penalty to help Gateway United secure a vital point which see them lead the log with 26 points. “What a game,” Ayila said after the game. “A hard-fought one. We knew it was risky to lose concentration at any point, so we glued our focus to the game. We planned for a win but we got a draw. Well, a point is better than none, a valuable point at that. The goalkeeper was outstanding. “I commend the boys for an impeccable showing. Nine matches to go, still a long way. So we will continue to take it a game after the other. Our ability at picking a point away is no longer in doubt, we will now focus on picking maximum home and away.” he concluded.
