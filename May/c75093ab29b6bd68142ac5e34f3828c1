Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of the Ikeja Special Offences Court, Lagos, on Friday dismissed a no-case submission by Victor Aduba, charged along with kidnap kingpin, Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike popularly known as Evans. Aduba, an ex-soldier, and Evans were charged with the offence of kidnapping a businessman, Sylvanus Ahamonu, and collection of $420,000 ransom from the victim’s family. The defence counsel, Emmanuel Ochai, had argued that prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case against the defendants and prayed the court to dismiss the charges against them. But the prosecution counsel, Yusuf Sule, opposed the prayer, insisting that the prosecution had furnished enough evidence warranting the defendants to open their defence. Justice Taiwo, in her ruling, held that the prosecution had established a prima facie case against Aduba, adding that his no-case submission filed on February 23 failed. The judge said, “I have carefully considered the submissions of the prosecution and the defence counsel. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
