Halo Financial Services Limited, a fintech start-up, has launched an innovative service that will help Nigerians manage and grow their money. During a press briefing in Lagos on Wednesday, the Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder, Chidimma Onyeokoro, said that Halo enabled communities to provide financial services to their members. Onyeokoro said, “Halo defines a community as any group of people with defined membership and identifiable leadership. “This includes professional or trade associations, cooperatives, social clubs, unions, even old boys’ and girls’ associations and more.” While noting that the company was keen on serving as many people as possible, she explained that Halo offered multi-channel access. For those comfortable with technology, she said, with an app, mass-market customers could transact with Halo via a nationwide network of agents, and high net worth communities could access a managed service. She stated that the fintech space in Nigeria was extremely competitive, so to meet Halo’s very ambitious goals, the firm had built a team of dynamic, knowledgeable, and committed professionals with a deep understanding of market realities.
