The Senate President and presidential aspirant of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Ahmad Lawan, on Friday said there was the need for the country to create wealth and diversify its economy. He also said if opportune to become the President in 2023, he would prioritise education and youth development. Speaking while addressing party delegates in Calabar, the Cross River State capital, he said, “I have garnered a lot of experience as a lawmaker as well as in other areas. I know that there are issues that need to be tackled including security, economy, and so on. We are ready and competent to handle every challenge. “As a country, we need to create wealth, employment opportunities, we believe in national development. This race is about improving the lives of Nigeria based on the ideals of our party. Nigeria cannot continue to depend only on oil, there is an urgent need for diversification, and our youths need to be fully part of our economy. We need to invest in education; it is the foundation of the development of every country. “If you look at a country like Singapore, they had almost nothing, but they invested in their youths through education and that turned their fortunes around. We need a knowledge-based economy which can only be built on education as it opens many doors of opportunities, we must invest now.” The governor, Prof Ben Ayade, who spoke earlier, stated that Lawan had been a great partner in the growth and development of the country.
