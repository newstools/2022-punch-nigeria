Kano State Governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, on Wednesday, purchased the expression of interest forms to vie for the Kano North Senatorial seat in 2023 in pursuit of his next political ambition. The governor’s media aide, Abba Anwa, who announced the development in a statement, said the form was purchased for Ganduje by stakeholders in the Kano North Senatorial District. The gesture, he claimed, was aimed at appreciating Ganduje’s political antecedents toward the spread of socio-economic development in Kano North. Already, Senator Barau Jibrin, who is currently representing Kano North has equally procured an expression of interest to re-contest in 2023. With this, the stage has been set for incumbent Senator Barau to slug it out with the governor whose tenure will elapse next year. Senator Barau on the other hand is not resting on his oars, as he has within the last one month been crisscrossing Local Government Areas, within his territorial zone, vigorously campaigning for continuity, insisting that he spread the dividends of democracy at the doorsteps of constituents. Similarly, Ganduje is campaigning underground to woo prominent stakeholders of Kano North to cast their votes for him, promising to add value to their lives. Earlier, Ganduje advanced reasons why he anointed his deputy to succeed him, pointing out that he has established that Dr Nasir Yusuf Gawuna has been a trusted and reliable partner, with whom he piloted the state to another level of socio-economic development. Besides, he explained that the decision was not unilateral but collective taken by prominent stakeholders and interest groups. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
