A political pressure group, the Nigerian Development Front, has urged the All Progressives Congress’ delegates to vote for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo in the May 29 presidential primary. The president of the NDF, Charles Adeyemi, said this when he spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria on Tuesday in Osogbo. Adeyemi said Osinbajo had displayed competency while carrying out his assignments as the number two man in the country. According to him, the choice of Osinbajo would be of great benefit to the party and the nation at large, looking at his vast experience compared to other aspirants. “Osinbajo understands the country’s challenges more than any aspirant and will hit the ground running from day one. “Delegates should consider the state of the nation over their pecuniary gains and vote for Osinbajo being the best in knowledge, firsthand experience, both national and international diplomacy. “If Osinbajo emerges as the party’s flagbearer in the 2023 presidential election, he will ensure improved security, economic diversification, infrastructure development, among others,” he said. Adeyemi said the NDF was making contacts with stakeholders in the South-West and other parts of the country toward ensuring that Osinbajo emerges as the party’s flagbear in the 2023 general election.
