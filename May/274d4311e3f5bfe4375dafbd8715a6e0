A presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party and Governor of Akwa Ibom state, Emmanuel Udom, has urged delegates in the forthcoming primary elections to rise beyond sentiment and elect leaders with track records of achievements. Udom said this while seeking the support of Niger State delegates during the primary election in Minna on Thursday. “A time has come when this country must rise beyond biases and sentiments and ensure that we vote a candidate that can take the party on the right path,” he said. The presidential aspirant said he has the solutions to the problems of Nigeria, adding that his achievements in Akwa Ibom are indications that he has the capacity to take Nigeria to the promise land. Emmanuel said, “I am the solution to Nigeria’s problems. I am the man that can build bridges, bring the youths back, advocate peace and take the bandits off the forests. I am the man who can restore all the lost glory of Nigeria. “You know about our Ibom Air, it is one of the best airlines in Nigeria and would soon start international trips. I can create money to develop infrastructure. I will bring Nigeria back and it will get back to her place in this continent. “Look at the things I have done to see if I can replicate it in a larger scale.” He assured women of proper representation of women in his government. “Women will be recognized in our government. They will have a proper place in our activities. We will implement the percentage needed.”, he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
