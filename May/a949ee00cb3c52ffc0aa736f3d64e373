Nigerian actress, Yvonne Jegede, on Friday shared her ordeal with a roadside robber in Lagos. According to her, she was almost robbed at the Third Mainland Bridge at about 9pm on Thursday night. The Nollywood star noted that she got lucky when the traffic moved a bit and she was able to move her car. In a tweet on Friday, she noted that the robber zoomed off as soon as she moved her car. She wrote, “Last night at about 9pm, one guy almost robbed me on 3rdMB. I was lucky the traffic moved a bit so I moved my car and then he took off.” The actress then called for a sanitisation of under the bridge at Oworonshoki, stating that that was where the attacker jumped out from. She further advised her fans to be safe as these robbers target people who are driving alone. “Under the bridge at Oworonshoki needs to be sanitized. The guy jumped out from under the bridge. They target people driving alone. Be safe guys,” Jegede wrote. Sharing a screenshot of the tweet on her Instagram page, the actress added, “If you are driving alone in traffic, don’t drive on the fast lane (the last lane by your left), let your car be in between cars. “Ladies especially, if you can, please stay wherever you are till you see daylight. There is hunger in town.” Jegede is not the only celebrity that has bemoaned Lagos traffic robbery. Music executive, Soso Soberekon and actor Chidi Mokeme had also shared their ordeals.
