Ahead of the 2023 general election, former Governor of Delta State, Chief James Onanefe Ibori has pleaded with delegates for the party primaries in Ethiope East Local Government Area of the State to vote his daughter, Erhiatake Ibori Suenu, who is aspiring for the House of Representatives seat. The PUNCH gathered that Chief Ibori visited the Ethiope East leaders and stakeholders on Tuesday where he passionately appealed to them to support his daughter in her political aspiration. “Do this for me. Vote my daughter, Hon. Erhiatake Ibori Suenu for the House of Representatives Ethiope Federal Constituency”, Ibori reportedly told them. A Facebook user, Sheriff Kokome from Oroakpor, Ethiope East Local Government Area of Delta State wrote on his Ogbe Collins page on Tuesday that the party delegates had since assured ex-governor Ibori of their readiness to support his daughter in the political contest. “We are going to do this for you our leader”, one of the party leaders in the Ethiope East constituency, Bernard Edewor, was quoted as assuring Ibori.
