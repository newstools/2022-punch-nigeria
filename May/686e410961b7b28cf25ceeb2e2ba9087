Joseph Waya, an uncle of a 2020 Big Brother Naija housemate, Terseer ‘Kiddwaya’ Waya, on Thursday, formally declared his interest in the governorship seat of Benue State on the platform of All Progressives Grand Alliance in the 2023 elections. Briefing journalists in his residence in Makurdi, Waya, a veteran journalist and ex-publisher of Accord Newspaper, expressed confidence that APGA would win the coming governorship election in the state in a free and fair contest. He said Benue people were yearning for a new direction, which only APGA could offer having tested the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party. Waya said, “Benue people have tested the two dominant parties, the PDP and the APC, and have not experienced the dividends of democracy for the past 22 years. “Benue, with all its potentials, is one of the most underdeveloped states in Nigeria. The people want a legitimate change. What ranks APGA above other parties is our antecedents. We have integrity and capacity to govern the state. “The cock, which is the symbol of the party, has spiritual and cultural connotations. It gives us a wake up call for a new dawn in our political atmosphere. “We will tackle insecurity not by politicising it. We will rather douse the tension and resolve it in a peaceful manner. “My government will give attention to the educational sector by encouraging technical and vocational education. Attention will be given to infrastructural development as well as industrialisation by establishing another cement company in the state. “We will set up cottage industries and resuscitate Lobi Bank to give loans to small scale entrepreneur in the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
