The leadership of the umbrella body for the indigenes of Osogbo known as Osogbo Progressives Union, on Thursday, warned people against dealing with those selling market stalls in Olugbeja Market. The group said the market is a property of Osogbo community, put in the custody of OPU, adding that whoever sold the stalls did illegal transaction. Addressing newsmen in Osogbo Thursday ahead of the general meeting of the union, OPU National President, Kamorudeen Makinde, said out of 400 stalls in the market, the group only had records of 36 tenants. He said, “We have 400 lock-up shops built by the community and put in the custody of the OPU. “Unfortunate, some unauthorised persons who lost out in the 2021 election of the group had conspired with some suspected fraudsters and sold off 364 shops along with other property to some private individuals. This is unfortunate. “We warn unsuspecting people against dealing with these people as OPU has already set machinery in motion to reclaim all property that have been illegally acquired.” Makinde then called on highly placed indigenes of the town to continue contributing to efforts to develop the community.
