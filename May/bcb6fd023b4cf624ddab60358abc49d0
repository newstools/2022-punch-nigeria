The Federal Government has received 618 hectares of land donated by eight communities in the Shendam Local Government Area of Plateau State for aggressive food production. According to the National Agricultural Land Development Authority, the land would be used for agricultural projects including cultivation of 200 hectares of maize farm for the 2022 wet season, five solar-powered boreholes for dry season irrigation farming, among others. The Executive Secretary, NALDA, Paul Ikonne, said in a statement issued in Abuja that the agency would deliver inputs such as seeds, herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers to about 600 farmers in the communities through their traditional rulers and youth leaders. He said land preparation activities had been carried out by the authority on part of the donated land, adding that over 1,000 metric tonnes of maize would be harvested from the farm. “The total land donated by the communities for the projects is 618 hectares, but for the first phase, 200 hectares would be cultivated with a targeted yield of 1,000 metric tonnes of maize,” Ikonne stated. He explained that the initiative was part of the efforts of the Federal Government to ensure that no matter the level of food crises that might arise from the effect of the Russia/Ukraine war, Nigeria would have enough food for its citizens.
