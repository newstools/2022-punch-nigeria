The Ichen Community in Bissaula in Kurmi Local Government Area of Taraba State on Monday kicked against the planned upgrade of 15 village areas to districts by the state government. The group which applauded Governor Darius Ishaku for his efforts at ensuring the return of peace between Ichen and Ndaka people said the proposed upgrade when the Commission of Inquiry into the crisis between Ichen and Ndaka in the area is yet to submit its report is ill-intended. Mr Fhatso Tukura who addressed a press conference in Jalingo on behalf of Ichen in the Bissaula called on the State House of Assembly to visit the proposed village areas to determine the suitability or otherwise of the proposal before giving the memo a legislative backing. Tukura said, “We appreciate the efforts of government in finding a solution to the crisis between the Ichen and Ndaka in Bissaula, including the setting up of a Commission of Inquiry. “However, we find it strange that the Chairman of Kurmi Local Government, Hon. Ammamzalla John-Danladi has sent a memo to the State Governor, requesting the upgrading of 15 village areas to districts and the creation of three additional districts in the Ichen and Ndola Chiefdoms. “The government’s priority should be to install the Third-Class Chief of Ichen Chiefdom in Kurmi Local Government, who will be in the best position to begin the process of creating more districts, rather than the Local Government Chairman. “The precedent of making every village area in Kurmi Local Government a district will mean that every village area in the state’s 16 local government areas will demand that their village areas be upgraded to districts, thereby undermining the importance of the exercise.” Copyright PUNCH.
