Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has been declared the winner of the Peoples Democratic Party’s governorship primary election in the state. The governor polled 1,040 votes while his challenger, Azeem Gbolarumi, scored two votes. The returning officer, Abdulahi Maibasira, declared Makinde the winner of the contest having scored the highest number of valid votes cast. Makinde, while reacting to his victory, said he was overwhelmed by the support of the people while calling on them to support him to win the governorship poll in 2023. He said he enjoyed the support of the people because he had been truthful to them since he took over power in 2019. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
