A dry-docking firm, Shipside Drydock Limited, says that it has been able to service over 400 vessels with its 5000-ton capacity floating dry dock in seven years. In a statement, the Deputy Managing Director and Business Lead, Shipside Drydock Limited, Sunday Esezobor, said that with that capacity, the firm was set to be West Africa’s dry-docking hub for ship maintenance. He said 96 per cent of the firm’s workforce were Nigerians. “Shipside Drydock has serviced over 400 vessels since it began operations in August of 2015. Its state-of-the-art workshop with a 5000-ton capacity floating dock has positioned it, not only to be a leader in the maritime sector of the Nigerian market but it is set to be the West African dry-docking hub for ship repairs and maintenance.” Esezobor noted that ship repair and maintenance sector had the potential to create more jobs if spare parts and steel were available, adding that Original Equipment Manufacturers were to be encouraged to set up shops in the country. He also said that the firm was willing to reduce capital flights as the marine ship owners would stop going abroad for maintenance and repairs of their ships and vessels. “At our floating dock, ship owners do not have to go abroad as we have the expertise and capacity to serve them. This will not only grow the industry but also save foreign exchange for the country,’’ he concluded.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
