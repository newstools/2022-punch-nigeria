The Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, on Friday visited Anambra State to meet with the All Progressives Congress stakeholders and delegates behind doors ahead of the party’s primaries. Osinbajo arrived at the venue of the meeting, Finotel Hotel, Awka, at exactly 10.58am and went straight into meeting with the APC members who were already on the ground. Journalists were ordered out of the venue as soon as the Vice President entered the meeting hall. The closed-door meeting lasted over two hours. Journalists were not briefed at the end of the meeting. But one of the stakeholders, who did not want his identity disclosed, claimed that the discussion centred on security. The stakeholder said, “Security is central to everything we are doing in this government because without security… but I believe that every government has its challenges. The challenge of this particular government is security because we are opening up everywhere. “We have opened up the North-East and containing the insecurity. The same with the North-West; we are also handling the cases of violence going on everywhere including in the South-East and the South-South. “For the first time, the law enforcement agencies in Nigeria are stretching, obviously beyond even their own capacity. If you have four or five different fronts where the law enforcement agents are required, there is no question that they will be there.” Earlier, the Governor of the state, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, was on the ground to receive the Vice President at the Anambra International Cargo and Passenger Airport, Umueri.
