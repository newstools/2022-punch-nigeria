Former champions Niger United of Minna defeated Confluence Stars 37-28 to continue their winning streak in the ongoing Prudent Energy Handball Premier League at Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja. The high tempo game was keenly contested in the early stages but Niger United began dominating the game towards the end of the first half. At the resumption of the second half, the Minna side took over the game fully and won the game to the admiration of the fans. In other games in the male category, Benue Buffaloes lost to Kano Pillars 24-37, while Police Machine inflicted the third defeat on Owena Kings 26-21. In the female category, Defender Babes lost to Safety Babes 22-31, Imo Grasshoppers and Rima Queens ended 37-37 stalemate, while Seasider Queens walked over Kada Queens. Coach Ronke Saliu of Owena Kings expressed disappointment over her side’s third defeat but was hopeful that they would bounce back in subsequent games. She regretted her inability to sign the players that have been training with her team because of paucity of funds, lamenting that they all left to other teams, which left her side depleted. She said, “It’s really demoralising to see my team lose three games in a row. We always give our best in all our games, but results have not gone our way. I am hopeful that we will win some games as the league progresses. The teams would have been stronger if we were able to sign some of the players that trained with us before the league began.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
