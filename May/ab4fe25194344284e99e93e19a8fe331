Terrorists who attacked the Abuja-Kaduna train attack on March 28, have set free one of the pregnant women among the abductees. Our correspondent gathered that the pregnant woman was released on a compassionate ground by the terrorist group suspected to be Ansaru Islamic sect, a breakaway of the Boko Haram sect. In a viral video trending on social media, the pregnant woman in black Abaya(long gown) attire with a face mask, called on the Federal Government to negotiate with bandits. This, she said, had become imperative as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the plight of others who were languishing in the terrorists’ den. She, however, added that they were been fed well by the terrorists, adding that the terrorists also take care of their medication.
