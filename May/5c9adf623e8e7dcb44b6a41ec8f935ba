Accord Party’s aspirant in the upcoming July 16 governorship election in Osun State, Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi, has again declared his capability to become the governor due to his competence as a business gladiator, which he said would benefit the people of the state. This was contained in a statement issued by a media officeer to the Akinade Ogunbiyi Campaign Committee, Mr. Emmanuel Adewumi, in Osogbo on Thursday. In March, Ogunbiyi rejoined the race with the formal declaration of his candidature under the Accord Political Party after deserting Peoples Democratic Party, where he was formerly a leading candidate. The statement partly read, “I am stepping forward for this cause to see Osun State fulfill its manifest destiny; become a beacon and pride of the people; and this nation, with the echoes of its unprecedentedly accelerated development ricocheting across Africa and the globe; and into coming generations. Let us all unequivocally say no to money mongers.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
