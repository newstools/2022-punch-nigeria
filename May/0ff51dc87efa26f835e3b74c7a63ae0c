The Deputy Managing Director, UBA, Oliver Alawuba, said the bank was committed to supporting businesses across the African continent. He spoke in Lagos during the fourth edition of its annual UBA Africa Conversations event organised to celebrate this year’s Africa Day in commemoration of African unity. Alawuba said, “It is from Africa that UBA Africa was set up. UBA has invested so much in Africa. We are in 20 African countries and four countries outside Africa. Our focus has always been on driving investments into Africa, through conversations such as this.” The bank said the UBA Africa Conversations was established in May 2019 as a hallmark initiative in a series of celebrations for Africa Day. The Conversations provides a platform for African and global audiences to connect with global thought leaders both in the private and public sectors, on their African journey, in a quest to change the narrative on Africa from desolate to successful. This year’s conversation was themed ‘The importance of reflecting our African culture in global success stories’ and underscored the tremendous shift in Africa’s cultural influence  – from Afrobeat to African films; Big African fashion labels and African authors; entertainment and culture. Legendary African musician and Songwriter, Youssou Ndour, gave the keynote address at the event and spoke on the need for collaboration to boost the continent’s fortunes. He added that UBA’s foray as an African bank into the United States of America was a testament to this fact. Former Commissioner for Tourism, Lagos State, Steve Ayorinde, who also sat on the panel, said the liberalisation of the media and digital content was helping to improve the African narrative.
