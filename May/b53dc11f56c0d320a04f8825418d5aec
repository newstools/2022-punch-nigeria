Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has explained why he endorsed his Deputy, Nasiru Gawuna, as the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress and his former Commissioner for Local Governments and Chieftaincy Affairs, Murtala Garo, as the running mate. Ganduje made the clarification at a stakeholders meeting of the APC in the state which was held at the Government House, Kano, on Tuesday. He explained that the decision to endorse Gawuna and Garo to succeed him was unanimously taken after exhaustive deliberations with all party stakeholders, adding that all party procedures were followed before arriving at the position. This was contained in a statement issued by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Abba Anwar, which was made available to journalists on Wednesday. “This time around, my deputy, Alhaji Nasiru Gawuna, is our choice for the governorship seat during the 2023 general elections. “He will contest with Murtala Garo as his running mate,” he said. Ganduje described Gawuna as a complete gentleman, a loyal and reliable person that knows what is right and wrong. For Garo, the governor stated, “He is a real commander, loyal and committed to our cause. This is a very fearless confidant. If you want to get a clear and clean political fight, you need somebody energetic, loyal and fearless. This is Murtala Garo for you.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
