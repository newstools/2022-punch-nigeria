Ebonyi State Governor and Chairman, South-East Governors’ Forum, David Umahi on Sunday, boasted that if he clinches the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress, he would defeat the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, before noon of the election day. The governor, who is a presidential aspirant of the APC, stated this when the national leadership of the Nigeria Union of Journalists and National Association of Women Journalists, paid him a courtesy visit at the new Presidential Lodge, Government House, Abakaliki, on Sunday. Umahi, who said he was not comfortable with the show of financial muscle exhibited by the presidential aspirants of the PDP during the party’s primary election in Abuja, added that “assuming I was the President, I would have impounded those vehicles in Abuja. I weep for this country.” The APC presidential aspirant emphasised that he left the PDP because the South-East was marginalised, adding that the achievements he had so far recorded under the APC administration remain unbeatable and indelible. He called on Nigerians to cast their votes for leaders with enviable pedigree and antecedents, rather than those without the vision to transform the country. Speaking on the agitation for Biafra, Umahi insisted that Ebonyi State was not part of Biafra as the state had over the years suffered disenfranchisement and marginalisation in the hands of other South-Eastern States. He applauded the President, Major-General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for his support to the growth and development of the state. While charging media practitioners to partner his administration in every sector advised them to guide against any behaviour that is capable of putting the media community in a bad light. Earlier, the National President of NUJ, Chris Isiguzo assured the governor of the cooperation of the media even as he commended Umahi for advancing the course of development in the state.
