Political bloc in the Ughelli South Constituency in the Delta State House of Assembly has kicked against the third term bid of the lawmaker representing the constituency, Reuben Izeze. The lawmaker is said to be scheming for a third term following clamour by some Ughievwen leaders who had over the years moved against anyone aspiring for a third term in the constituency. Worried by the political developments in the area, concerned Ughelli South Youths for Equity and Justice said that the people of the constituency would vehemently resist any attempt to impose Izeze on them. They argued that Izeze himself, who had been a major campaigner against third term ambition, could turn around to start scheming for the same thing. The group said this in a statement on Saturday jointly signed by its Chairman and Secretary, Mr John Diakparomre and Mr Emma Ejovwokiniovo respectively. They said, “We strongly advise the leaders and people of Ughievwen to desist from the evil plot of sponsoring the incumbent, Hon Reuben Yakubu Izeze, for a third term. “Third term is against the noble tradition of Ughelli South. Senator Pius Ewherido, of blessed memory did two terms and handed over to Olorogun Taleb Tebite who did two terms. “Tebite wanted a third term to make it 12 years but failed because you never supported it. Now this same Ughievwen people who refused to support Tebite for third term are same people clamouring for Izeze’s third term because of greed and expectation that he will make their wives Special Assistants and Personal Assistants.” Copyright PUNCH.
