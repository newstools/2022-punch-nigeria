The Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Thursday, flagged off rehabilitation of roads in Osogbo Federal Constituency with an assurance not to neglect governance for politicking. Oyetola gave the assurance in Ilobu during the flag off of rehabilitation work on three selected roads cutting across the Osogbo, Ilobu, Ifon and Egbedore local government areas of the state, a project that would cost the government a sum of N3,265,623,449.00. The repair work on the roads, namely: Osogbo (LAMECO)-Okinni-Ilobu-Ifon Osun Market with Spur to Olobu’s Palace (9.8km); Osogbo/Ilobu Road-Ire Akari-Erin Osun Round About-Erin Osun LCDA Junction Road (3.21km); and Post Office-Aiyetoro-Jamodo-Olufon Palace-Janta Road, Ifon Osun (2.1km), Oyetola said was to fulfil the promise by his administration to continue to provide good infrastructural amenities in all parts of the state. The governor further said, “I stand to confirm to you that as we gravitate towards completing this term, politics and governance will go hand in hand. “It is also a clear indication that we shall continue to build a stable, strong and prosperous Osun that our people and posterity shall be proud of. “In the spirit of continuity and inclusive governance, we have constructed and rehabilitated scores of roads to transform our economy, some inherited and others initiated by us. These are proofs that ours is a government for all, irrespective of political affiliation. We believe, and rightly so, that we were elected into office to do governance and not politics.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
