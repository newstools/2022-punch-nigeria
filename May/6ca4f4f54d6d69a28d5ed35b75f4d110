United Bank for Africa has expanded services of Leo, its Artificial Intelligence chatbot to Google Business Chat and Instagram. The bank said in a statement that “Leo – UBA’s AI-powered chatbot, which enables customers to make use of their social media accounts to carry out key banking transactions, was first introduced in January, 2018. “It has since evolved to become a custom-fitted, personalised virtual banker to several UBA customers across its 20 African countries.” Before now, it said, UBA’s Leo was servicing customers on Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp and Apple Chat. The bank also upgraded the existing features of Leo, where customers could now carry out their activities in a 3D animated format. Armed with this upgrade and with its recent expansion to Instagram and Google Business, it said, customers would now be able to carry out more transactions from the comfort of their homes and could perform more activities such as funds transfer, checking balances, buying airtime and data, and getting their bank statements with ease, from any of these social media platforms. The Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, UBA, Kennedy Uzoka, who spoke about the upgraded features of Leo, explained that the bank was always on the lookout for innovative ways to develop strategies aimed at easing transactions for the bank’s numerous users, while ensuring utmost safety of their transactions.
