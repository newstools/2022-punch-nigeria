A former member of the House of Representatives from Gombe State, Khamisu Mailantarki, on Saturday dumped the ruling All Progressives Congress. Mailantarki contested and won the Gombe/Kwami/Funakaye Federal Constituency election under the defunct Congress for Progressive Change in 2011, where he polled 122,987 votes – the highest in the House of Representatives elections history. However, he contested 2015 but was removed by the Supreme Court, which declared Yaya Tongo as the authentic winner of the APC primary election of the Gombe/Kwami/Funakaye Federal Constituency. The former federal lawmaker was a Board Member of the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission. His resignation letter, addressed to the APC Chairman, Herwagana Ward of Gombe Local Government Area, partly read, “With gratitude to the Almighty Allah, I hereby wish to notify you of my decision to resign my membership of the All Progressives Congress. “I thank you and the entire membership of the party for your support while my membership lasted.” Commenting further about his decision, Mailantarki revealed that it was hinged on the interest of the state and his political future, adding that he would not have left the party he contributed immensely to build. “As the only member elected under the Congress for Progressives Change, I personally funded the entire process of merger in Gombe State and I was the returning officer of President Buhari’s election in 2019 in the state. “Even after the guber primaries in the state, we supported President Buhari and Governor Inuwa Yahaya and made sure APC won to an extent that we converted Gombe from fully PDP to fully APC state,” he said.
