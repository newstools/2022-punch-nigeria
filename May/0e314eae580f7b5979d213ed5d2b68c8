THE National Senior Secondary School Education Commission has vowed to deal with schools, parents and guardians found to be aiding and abetting examination malpractice at the post-basic education level. The commission warned  that both the culprits and accomplices would be arrested and prosecuted within the ambit of the law to serve as a deterrent to others . The warning was handed down by the pioneer chairman of NSSSEC, Ambassador Nimota Akanbi in a statement released in Ilorin, Kwara State on Thursday. She expressed worry over the rising cases of malpractices during the conduct of external examinations at secondary school level with the alleged connivance of some parents. Akanbi noted that the unacceptable trend had lingered too long despite the effort of the federal government through the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, to nip it in the bud. She warned that the commission would not fold its arms and allow unscrupulous elements have their ways in their desperate bid to destroy the future of children and education system in the country. Akanbi said it was saddening that some parents and their accomplices were unperturbed about the bleak future in the event that the unwholesome activities persist. She stated that NSSSEC was established to standardise the educational system at post-basic level, urging stakeholders to help  reduce the tide of examination fraud for the sake of the nation’s future.
