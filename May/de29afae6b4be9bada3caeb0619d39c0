A former Secretary to Ebonyi State Government, Prof. Benard Odoh, on Sunday, emerged the All Progressives Grand Alliance, governorship candidate for the 2023 general elections in the state. Odoh polled 513 votes to emerge the candidate of the party during the primary election, which took place at the party’s state secretariat in Abakaliki. The Chairman of the state APGA Governorship Primary Election Committee in Ebonyi, Dr. Olalere Samson, who announced the results, said Odoh picked all the votes, having contested unopposed. In his acceptance speech, Odoh described his victory as the beginning of the eventual liberation for the people of the state. He described APGA as the only viable party in the state, arguing that the ruling All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party have been torn beyond redemption by crises.
