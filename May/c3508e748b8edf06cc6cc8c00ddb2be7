Former Super Eagles forward, Nnamdi Oduamadi, is delighted to have won the Serie D Group B player of the season award, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Oduamadi currently on a six months loan at Italian fourth-tier club Colleferro scored five times in 12 appearances. He had previously featured for Crema in the same division where he scored thrice in seven games. ‪The 31-year-old, who scored a hat-trick for the Eagles in their 6-1 drubbing of Tahiti at the 2013 Confederations Cup said he joined Colleferro in January in a bid to revive his career. The winger left AC Milan permanently for Albania club KF Tirana in September 2018 after a decade with the Rossoneri believes he still has plenty to offer. Oduamadi began his career with Flying Sports academy and went on to play for Torino, Latina, Varese, Crotone, Brescia, HJK Helsinki, Tirana before joining Colleferro in January. “I’m delighted to have won this award and I hope to use this as a launch pad to get back to the top again,” he told PUNCH Sports Extra. “As a free agent things are not really that easy, but you can only be hopeful. ‪”My desire is to get back to the top again. I am working hard towards achieving that. ‪”Football is everything I have within me and I will just give up. I believe I can still play topflight football again.” ‪Despite playing in 14 matches and scoring four goals for the three-time African champions, his international career stalled and he missed out on the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Oduamadi scored a stoppage-time goal for Nigeria against Kenya in a World Cup qualification in Calabar on March 23, 2013. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
