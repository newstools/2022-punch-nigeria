The National President, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, Bishop Wale Oke, on Saturday said that Christians would not vote for any political party fielding Muslims as both president and vice-presidential candidates in the 2023 general election. Oke spoke in Osogbo during a service marking the 30th anniversary of the establishment of PFN in Osun State. The cleric also said it would be inappropriate for the President, Maj. Gen Mohammadu Buhari (retd.), to hand over to another Muslim as president. He warned political parties not to consider picking two Muslims as both president and vice president, adding that doing so would make the PFN mobilise against them. A statement by Osun PFN Director of Media, Bishop Seun Adeoye, quoted Oke as saying, “The Church in Nigeria is saying no to a Muslim-Muslim ticket. We are going to mobilise the church against such a political party. PFN has 65 million people and we will vote against such a party. “Obasanjo handed over to Yar’adua, Yar’adua to Jonathan, and Jonathan to Buhari and who else should Buhari hand over to, but a Christian.” Oke also called on PFN members to collect their Permanent Voter Cards and vote against any bad government.
