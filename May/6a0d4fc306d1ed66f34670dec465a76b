An All Progressives Congress senatorial aspirant for the Ondo North Senatorial District of Ondo State, Chief Alex Ajipe, has said there is no truth in some reports that Governor Rotimi Akeredolu has anointed an aspirant ahead of the primary. Ajipe, in a statement by the Director of Media, Ajipe Campaign Organisation, said the governor, who is also the leader of the party, did not anoint any of the aspirants to emerge as the candidate of the party for the 2023 senatorial election. The statement read, “Without any fear of contradiction from any quarter, we say that the story on the purported anointing of a certain aspirant ahead of the Ondo North Senatorial District primary is a lie from the pit of hell and a figment of the writer’s imagination. “It is imperative to make it clear what the Electoral Act says on consensus candidacy. For those who may not know, the Act unambiguously spelt it out that politicians who are seeking the party’s tickets for elective positions must tender written consent of their withdrawal before political parties can adopt consensus candidates. “Having cleared whatever doubt(s) may exist in the minds of the purveyor of the lies, the Ajipe Campaign Organisation, with all seriousness, hereby denies the existence of any arrangement of a consensus agreement among the aspirants for the Ondo North Senatorial District on the platform of the APC.” The statement noted that having been screened to contest the primary on May 27, Ajipe was focused on winning the election. “We are convinced beyond any doubt that the position of the governor is to allow a level playing field is still sacrosanct. Those relying on powers that be would be disappointed at the end of the day,” it added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
