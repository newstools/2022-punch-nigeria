A 19-year-old man, David Tony, allegedly kidnapped by gunmen in Ungwan Bulus, Kaduna State, and later released has died of health-related complications. It was learnt that Tony died on Thursday at the 44 Army Hospital in Kaduna from the complications he suffered in captivity. The teenager was kidnapped from his house along with his parents and two siblings by suspected terrorists in the Chikun Local Government Area of the state on March 30, 2022. Tony was said to have been on medication before his abduction but his condition deteriorated after spending two weeks in captivity. He was later said to have been released by the abductors. City Round gathered that he was first taken to a hospital in Ungwan Boro after he vomited and stooled blood and was referred to 44 Army Hospital where he died. It was also learnt that the deceased was buried at the Sabon Tasha Cemetery on Friday. Five million naira ransom was said to have been paid before the release of Tony and his family by their abductors who also allegedly demanded new motorcycles. Speaking shortly after Tony’s burial, his uncle, Pastor David Okoh, said the teenager’s parents were released last Saturday. Okoh said, “After he was released by their abductors, his parents weren’t released until last Saturday. Before their abduction, Tony was on medication. “The two weeks spent with the terrorists affected him. We first took him to a hospital in Ungwan Boro after he was vomiting and stooling blood, from where we were referred to 44 Army Hospital. He was given about four pints of blood but unfortunately, he didn’t survive.’’ Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
