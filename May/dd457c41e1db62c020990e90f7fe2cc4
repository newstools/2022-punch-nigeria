A political support group, The Patriots for Ogbonnaya Onu, on Friday, urged the All Progressives Congress to pick a former Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, as its consensus presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections. The leader of TPFOO and former Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academics), University of Port Harcourt, Prof. Hakeem Fawehinmi, said this during a press conference in Abuja. Fawehinmi, a nephew of the late human rights activist, Gani Fawehinmi (SAN), said Onu had displayed competency while carrying out his assignments as the former governor of Abia State and a two-term federal minister in the country. According to Fawehinmi, considering Onu’s vast experience compared to other aspirants, choosing him would be of great benefit to the APC and the nation at large. He said, “As governor, he (Onu) promoted national unity by abolishing the state of origin syndrome and appointed non-indigenes to key political and administrative positions in the state. “We urge the ruling APC to put its best foot forward and adopt Dr Ogbonnaya Onu as its consensus presidential standard bearer in its legitimate quest to retain power at the centre post-2023. “Dr Ogbonnaya Onu’s election will assuage the feeling of real or perceived marginalisation among the Ndigbo that constitute about a quarter of the country’s population, guarantee their full reintegration in the post-civil war Nigerian state.” Fawehinmi said the TPFOO was making contacts with stakeholders in the APC and other parts of the country with a view to ensuring that Onu emerged as the APC’s flag bearer in the 2023 general election.
