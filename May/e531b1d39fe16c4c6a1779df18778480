Super Eagles defender, Calvin Bassey, has ruled out a move away from Glasgow Rangers this summer, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Bassey who posted another stellar performance for the Gers as they clinched the Scottish Cup at the expense of Hearts for the first time in 13 years has been linked with a move Aston Villa and Fulham. Two goals in three extra-time minutes by substitutes Ryan Jack and Scott Wright eased Rangers’ pain of their Europa League final defeat last Wednesday. Speaking after his side’s victory at Hampden Park, the 22-year-old who won the man of the match award said his focus is on Rangers and his preparation and mindset is on coming back stronger and fitter for next season. “It feels unbelievable,” Bassey told Premier Sports. “I think the boys have been excellent this season, we’ve worked so hard. “We had huge disappointment on Wednesday but to come back from that, 120 minutes there and another extra-time, it shows real character, drive and just how much each and every one of us loves this club. “We just want to give our best and we are happy to end it with a reward. “I thank my teammates. It’s not a one-man team, each and every one of them helps me get better every day to get me where I am. “And the manager and the coaching staff to trust me and push me. I can’t thank my teammates enough. “I just want to keep my head down and keep pushing hard. “I’m focused here. I’m here and I’m ready to get ready to come here for pre-season and be fitter than I was last pre-season and ready to see what next season holds for me and the boys.” Copyright PUNCH.
