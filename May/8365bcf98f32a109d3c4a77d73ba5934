The National Leader of All Progressives Congress and presidential aspirant, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has promised to work towards creating a stronger and more prosperous Nigeria that will surpass the dreams of the country’s founding fathers. According to a statement issued by Tinubu Media Office on Tuesday, the former governor of Lagos State said this when he met with APC delegates in Katsina State, on Monday. Those in attendance included the Governor of Katsina State, Aminu Masari, his deputy, Alhaji Muniru Yakubu, and the APC Chairman in the state, Alhaji Sani Aliyu Daura, among others. Addressing the delegates, Tinubu was said to have promised to look into the irrigation problem in Katsina and also help in defeating poverty, hunger, banditry and violence in the state if elected president. “Katsina has many dams. We will work with the state to reticulate them. We will do this to combat irrigation. Katsina has the resources to be an industrial hub, to be a centre for industrialisation and prosperity,” he said. The presidential aspirant urged the delegates to support him in emerging as the party’s candidate up to the point of becoming president in 2023. “Anybody can contest. Not anybody has what it takes to be president. I have the vision, the passion, the capacity and the competence to deliver for the country,” he told the delegates. Copyright PUNCH.
