Not fewer than four commissioners in the Ebonyi Executive Council have resigned to pursue their  various political ambitions in the 2023 general elections. The Commissioner for Information, Uchenna Orji, stated this on Friday in Abakaliki while briefing journalists on the outcome of the council’s weekly meeting. According to him, the council received a report on such members’ resignation and therefore accepted the resignations. He said, “The concerned members include Chief Onyekachi Nwebonyi, former Commissioner for Capital City and Urban Development and Chief Emma Uguru, former Commissioner for Lands and Survey. “Mr Pastor Eze Nwachukwu, former Commissioner for Inter-Party Affairs and Mr Ukie Ezeali, former Commissioner for Business Development also resigned.” Orji further announced that the governor signed an Executive Order on indiscriminate pasting of posters and erection of billboards across the state. “The Executive Council noted that the order was welcome to enhance the state’s status of having one of the cleanest capitals in the country,” he added.
