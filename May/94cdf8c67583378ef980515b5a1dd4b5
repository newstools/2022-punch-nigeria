A Professor of Crop Science, Adesola Ajayi, has taken over as the Vice-Chancellor of the First Technical University, Ibadan. The inauguration of the Igbojaiye, Oyo State-born scholar and administrator was held at the university on Monday, May 9, 2022. The tenure of his predecessor, Prof. Ayobami Salami, ended on May 8. In his address in which he saluted Salami for having been his mentor and for having believed in him, Ajayi promised to work harder and creatively to expand the success the university had recorded. He unfolded a mission statement targeting strategic improvement on the solid foundation laid by Salami. He said, “The thrust of this five-year (2022-2027) mission statement is to grow the university by building on the solid foundation, the glorious beginning and the trajectory of achievements of the pioneer management of the First Technical University (Tech-U), 2017-2022. The Management did not spare effort in ensuring that the institution has the full complement of what a university should have and indeed a solid foundation was laid such that subsequent Management needs only to grow and expand on the existing structures that have been established.” Salami described the day as one of the happiest days of his life as, according to him, he had left the university in the hands of a worthy successor.
