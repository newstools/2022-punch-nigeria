Mike Ozekhome’s Chambers, lawyers to the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, said the banker aspires to become Nigeria’s president and participate as a candidate in the 2023 presidential election. A lawyer from the chambers, Maliki Sylvanus, disclosed this in an affidavit in support of Emefiele’s originating summons filed before a Federal High Court, Abuja Division and marked FHC/ABJ/CS/610/2022. This is contrary to Emefiele’s claim on Friday that he is still waiting on God to take a decision on the matter. In the four-page affidavit, Sylvanus, a senior counsel in Mike Ozekhome’s Chambers, wrote, “That the facts deposed to herein be within my personal knowledge except as otherwise stated, and was duly informed by the plaintiff, Mr. Godwin Emefiele. “That the plaintiff is Nigerian citizen, economist, banker, and financial expert who has been serving as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria since June 4, 2014. “That the plaintiff aspires to seek election to the office of President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and participate as a candidate in the upcoming 2023 presidential elections.” Details later… Copyright PUNCH.
