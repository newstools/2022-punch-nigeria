The family of the late Bamise Ayanwola, the 22-year-old fashion designer allegedly killed by a BRT driver in Lagos, have taken to the street on Tuesday to demand justice for Bamise. They gathered in Magodo area of Lagos with banners bearing inscriptions like “Delayed justice is dangerous”, and “Arrest and Arraign Nice Omininikoron’s Accomplices Now.” One of the sisters of late Bamise, Titi Ayanwola, while addressing the press, said, “We want them to arrest every accomplice connected to Bamise’s death. Our father and mother are asking, that, whether it is the king or president that has a hand in Bamise’s death, they should be brought out. Another sister, Ebunoluwa Ayanwola, who came out with her newly born baby, said, “I had to go through a cesarean section to give birth, I am not supposed to come out by now. If justice is not given to my sister, Lagos State will not know peace.” “I could not give birth through normal labour because of the effect my sister’s death had on me,” she said while addressing Koiki Media. They noted that the government had the capacity to arrest all the accomplices involved, and wondered why they had not done it.  The PUNCH reported that the family of late Bamise had rejected an alleged plan by the Nigeria Police to conduct an autopsy on the body of the deceased. Rather, the family demanded that the police should ensure that the dress the late Bamise wore at the time of her death as well as her mobile phone and other personal belongings were not tampered with. As of the time of filing this report, the protesting families and friends had reached the Office of the Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Femi Hamzat, to further table their demands. Copyright PUNCH.
