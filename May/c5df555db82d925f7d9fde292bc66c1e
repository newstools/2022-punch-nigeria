An All Progressives Congress governorship aspirant in Lagos State, Wale Oluwo, has protested his exclusion from the primary of the party held on Thursday at the Mobolaji Johnson Arena, formerly known as Onikan Stadium, in the Lagos Island area of the state. In a statement on Thursday, Oluwo said the screening committee of the party worked with powerful individuals to prevent him from the primary. Oluwo, a former Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources and an ally of ex-governor Akinwunmi Ambode, however, said “the will of the people will not be subverted”. “These discomforted powerful individuals have even gone to great lengths to prevent me from participating in the primary election of today by excluding me in a manner similar to the last Edo State episode where a sitting governor was denied participation in the internal democracy process of his party,” he said. The PUNCH had earlier reported that another aspirant, Abdul-Ahmed Mustapha, said he was excluded from the contest which was supposed to be a three-man race. The former Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Energy and Minerals Resources in Lagos described the process as anti-democratic. Mustapha and Oluwo are supposed to be in the race with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the anointed aspirant of APC leader, Bola Tinubu. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
