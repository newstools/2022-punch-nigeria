The Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, in the late hours of Monday, was declared the winner of the senatorial seat of Benue North West senatorial zone. He emerged as an unopposed candidate. The seat is presently been occupied by Senator Orker Jev, who, through the support of governor Ortom, defeated the All Progressives Congress’ candidate and incumbent minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, Senator George Akume in the 2019 general election. Ortom after he assisted Jev to win the 2019 senatorial election boasted that he was going to retire his estranged godfather, Senator Akume from politics. But Jev who did not allow the victory, then, to overwhelm him had said that Senator Akume remained his godfather. In a statement issued by governor Ortom’s media aide and made available to journalists Monday night, the governor expressed appreciation to the people of the zone for always standing with him. “He said he was pleased to be given another opportunity to serve the state at the Senate at the expiration of his tenure as governor. “People of the State, especially the people of Benue North-West, have demonstrated an  uncommon support to him, pointing out that “I have nothing to pay back than to remain their loyal servant, to give all to their service, adding, ‘the interest of the people will always be my priority.” Copyright PUNCH.
