A mother of four arrested for allegedly selling a human skull in Benin, Edo State, Mrs Josephine Adun, on Thursday, said she regretted her action and advised other women not to get involved in crime. She stated this while being paraded by the Edo State Police Command alongside other suspects. “I want to use this medium to advise other women and mothers not to sell human parts to anybody or engage in crime no matter how much you are promised as reward. I have learnt my lessons,” she said. The divorcee, while speaking on her level of involvement, said one Charity Goodluck approached her for a human skull, which she sold to him for N40,000. She said she bought the skull for N8,000 from a cemetery worker. The suspect, who dealt in traditional items, said for a good job, Goodluck gifted her extra N5,000. She said she sold the skull to Goodluck in February, adding that she was arrested in May 2022. On his part, Goodluck, 29, a heavy duty operator, said a herbalist told him to bring the skull to enable him to become more prosperous in his business. The herbalist, Olusola Oyowokemi, said Goodluck approached him that he needed soap and he advised him to get a skull for a ritual. The 42-year-old herbalist said two months later, Goodluck came to him with the skull, which he used for the ritual. The Edo State Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro, assured that the command would not allow criminal elements take over the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
