The Founder and Chancellor of Gregory University Uturu, Prof. Gregory Ibe, has won the All Progressive Grand Alliance governorship primary in Abia State. The Returning Officer, Echezona Etiaba, on Sunday night after the election announced that Prof. Ibe polled 283 votes to defeat his closest rival, Etigwe Uwa, who polled 188 votes. Others are Ijioma Ijioma, 36, and Chikwe Udensi, 12 votes. In his acceptance speech, Prof. Ibe urged the losers to accept the result in good faith and to join hands with him to develop Abia. He said the time has come to change Abia, adding “Jericho wall has fallen; no APC, no PDP in Abia”. Abia, he said, has been abandoned and left to rot, stating that if elected the state governor in 2023, he will bring prosperity to the state. However, one of the contestants, Ijioma said he would challenge the result up to the Supreme Court as the total votes did not tally with the total number of registered voters. Copyright PUNCH.
