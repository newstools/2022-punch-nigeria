Nigerian comedian, Debo Adedayo, popularly known as Mr Macaroni, has cleared the air on the wedding-themed photos he earlier shared with fellow skit maker, Kemi Ikuseedun, also known as Mummy Wa. Mr Macaroni had on April 23 and 24, shared wedding-themed pictures of himself and Mummy wa, who always acted as his wife in his skits. The pictures, however, caused a lot of uncertainties among his fans, as they wondered if it was a real wedding or a skit. But in a tweet on Tuesday, which is also Mr Macaroni’s birthday, the comedian noted that he wasn’t married to Mummy wa. The comedian who just turned 29 said this while thanking his fans for their wishes. He wrote, “Thank you all for your kind messages. 29 feels good! Confession: I’m not married ooo.” See some of the wedding-themed photos below:   Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
