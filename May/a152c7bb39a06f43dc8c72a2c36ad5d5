The state working committee of Zamfara State’s Peoples Democratic Party has announced the suspension of the state’s party Chairman, Retired Colonel Bala Mande, until the conclusion of investigation into the allegations raised against him of selling the party’s secrets to other people in exchange for gratifications. According to the statement by the state’s party publicity secretary, Abba Bello, made available to our correspondent, the chairman was suspended over anti-party activities among others. The statement added, “this becomes necessary owing to the fact that the State Chairman has been conducting the affairs of the party without the involvement of the State Working committee, selling secret to higher bidder for gratifications.” The statement said his actions were in clear violation of the various sections of the PDP constitution. It added, “this has become necessary to forestall the abuse of power and the derailment of the rules governing the running of the party by Col Mande (retd.). “The suspension is for a period of one month, this is expedient to allow the Working Committee to constitute a panel of inquiry into the allegation. “Considering the foregoing, the Vice-Chairman, Kaura Namoda zone, Mallam Ali Namoda, will oversee the activities of the party for the period of his suspension.” Bello further said the state working committee had inaugurated a panel of inquiry to investigate this allegation. The members of the panel were Ahmed Sani, Kaura Chairman; Bala Zurmi, Member; Sanin Baba, member; Abdulhadi Ahmed, member; Suwaiba Bako, Member; Abul Mustapha, member; and Ibrahim Jibril, who was to serve as Secretary.
