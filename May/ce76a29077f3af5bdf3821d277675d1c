American hip-hop star, DeMun Wilburn, better known as Future, has applauded Nigerian singer, Tems for her vocal prowess. This follows a collaboration by both artistes and Drake titled “Wait For U,” which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot100 charts. Future took to his Twitter page on Thursday, where he wrote in all caps, “@temsbaby voice is amazing.” Speaking of their collaboration, the rapper said he felt a connection after hearing her voice over a beat by ATL Jacob, one of the producers on his new album, I Never Liked You. “As soon as I heard the @temsbaby sample over @atljacobbeatz, it instantly connected to my soul,” he tweeted. He added, “Even though” Wait For U” is a sample and not an original recording, I still put it featuring @temsbaby, if you aren’t familiar with her work. Thank you, Tems.” Tems also replied to the rapper, “Appreciate you! @1future.” “Wait For U” is the seventh song on Future’s new LP album, I Never Liked You. Released on April 29, the project is already doing numbers on streaming platforms and charts. All 16 tracks from the album are currently charting on the Billboard Hot100. I Never Liked You also debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 charts, selling 222,000 equivalent album units in its first week in the United States. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
