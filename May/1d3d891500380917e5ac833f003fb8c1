The Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has cautioned the people of the state not to see the reopening of the nation’s borders as an avenue to engage in illicit activities capable of hurrying the economy. Abiodun spoke at the 10th coronation anniversary of the Olu of Ilaro and paramount ruler of Yewaland, Oba Kehinde Olugbenle, on Saturday. The governor said the people should see the reopening of the borders as a mark of the Federal Government’s commitment to the development of the country. He said “We are happy that the Federal Government has reopened some land borders, among the borders is the Idi-Iroko border in Ogun State. “I enjoin us all to cooperate with law enforcement agencies. We should not engage in illicit activities, such illegal activities do a lot of damage to our economy.” He also appealed to security agencies to continually see the people as partners in progress and avoid loss of lives and property associated with clashes between security agencies and the people. Abiodun urged the people to use their power rightly by voting in credible leaders, saying voters shouldn’t allow themselves to be deceived or used by unprincipled politicians. Commending the monarch, Abiodun described the Olu of Ilaro as a true representation of royalty who continued to contribute to the success of his administration. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
