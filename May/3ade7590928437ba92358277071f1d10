THE Founder of Kee Foundation, Ifeoma Theodore, has advised the government and other stakeholders to publish and expose children to books on sex education and morals. A statement by the NGO stated that Theodore who was also involved in the Diamond Woman Initiative, and the author of “Trapped in Oblivion”, said, “Exposing children to relevant books cannot be overemphasised, this will impact their psyche and enable them to see the danger and consequences of engaging in sex and other immoral acts. She said, “Children need more than government scholarship, school bags and other incentives, but proper knowledge of sex education in form of books will go a long way to giving  every child residual knowledge needed to guide him or her. “Parents, teachers, and the government should give the necessary attention to the moral and educational development of children in order to make the society a better place.” She called on parents, government, and  institutions to partner with the foundation so that they can all work together for proper training of children and to prepare them for every trial and temptation in the area of sex and other immoral acts. Theodore also warned parents about the danger of exposing their wards to early usage of mobile phones as they might be encouraging unhealthy relationships with the opposite sex, aside pornograhic and other dirty materials found online.
