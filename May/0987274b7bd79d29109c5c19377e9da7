A presidential aspirant in the 2023 general elections, Olufemi Ajadi, has pledged to fully integrate Nollywood stars into his government if elected President. This was as he also commended the Nigerian entertainment industry for entertaining and educating Nigerians through movies. A statement made available to The PUNCH on Thursday noted that the aspirant made the pledge during an interaction with journalists in Lagos. Ajadi said that Nigerian actors and actresses would play key roles in his government both as ministers and directors-general of strategic parastatals. Ajadi was quoted as saying, “We are all aware of the contributions that the sector has been making to the economic and social development of the country, with the result that is competing favourably with Hollywood and Bollywood. “That is commendable and our plan is to further lift Nollywood. “I personally believe that more film villages for the sector would not be a bad idea. “This will complement what the practitioners already have in Asaba, the Delta State capital”. “As for other incentives likely to impact on the personal lives of the practitioners, we will keep it in wraps for now.” Ajadi added that movie practitioners deserve commendation for helping in laundering the image of the country, in creating wealth and also providing recreation for millions of viewers across the divide.
