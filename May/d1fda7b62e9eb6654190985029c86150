According to Cordros Capital, impressive corporate earnings by bellwether stocks supported market performance last week, as investors increased their bets on blue-chip companies in anticipation of continued expansion in profits. On its forecast, it stated, “In the week ahead, we expect investors to continue to rotate their portfolios towards cyclical stocks that delivered decent earnings this week. Thus, we see scope for the bulls to maintain dominance, albeit the magnitude of the gains will be substantially lower, as profit takers are likely to cash out on the gains across bellwether stocks. “Notwithstanding, we reiterate the need for positioning in only fundamentally sound stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.”  Copyright PUNCH.
