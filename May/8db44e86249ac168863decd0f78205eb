A cross-section of accredited delegates in the ongoing All Progressives Congress Governorship primaries election has raised the alarm of impersonation allegedly perpetrated by some unknown persons. Reacting while speaking with journalists at the party Secretariat, an accredited delegate, Aminu Umar, from the Tangaza Local Government Area lamented how his council’s was allegedly affected. “We asked them (alleged impersonators) to identify themselves. But they rather brought out counterfeit party identification cards and delegate tags on them. We have to call on security agencies to fish them out within us,” he claimed. Another delegate appealed to the party leadership in the state to ensure a transparent and credible exercise. “We are calling on the state executive members to confirm if they are from our party. Some of them have already been accredited for the exercise. “We need the proactive intervention of our election committee to be vigilant and listen to all complaints to ensure a credible exercise. “We know ourselves who were duly elected as delegates for this gubernatorial primaries. We urged the party leadership to fish out the impersonators among us before the commencement of this exercise,” he lamented. Recall that two out of the seven aspirants, Senator Abubakar Gada and Abdullahi Balarabe Salame had decided not to participate in the exercise due to the refusal of the national leadership of the party to accede to their demands for direct primaries in the state. Those who are on the ballot papers include the candidate of the party in the 2019 exercise, Ahmed Aliyu Sokoto, Abdullahi Ibrahim Gobir, Yusuf Suleiman, Faruk Malami Yabo and Alhaji Abubakar Gumbi.
