Popular singer, Kizz Daniel, has said that his new song titled, Buga, is meant to celebrate hard work and success. Recall that the song is undoubtedly one of the most popular songs in the country at the moment. It is currently the lead song on Apple Music’s Top 100 Chart in Nigeria, while it is also one of the world’s top five afrobeats songs. In an interview with Sunday Scoop, the singer said, “Buga means to ‘show off’. In this context, it means that after one has put in the work, one should let one’s results speak loudly. Enjoy your success. Whatever you’re seeing out there, whatever results the song is generating, that’s the result of hard work. I have consistently put in my best into all my songs. Nothing good comes easy. “As long as people work hard to make legitimate money, they should be proud to flaunt their wealth.” Daniel, who is also known as Vado D Great, stated that anytime any of his songs enjoy wide acceptance, it encourages him to do even more. He said, “It is a great feeling when one puts out a masterpiece and the rest of the world accepts it as one. It is indeed a satisfying feeling right. And, such encourages me to do more.” Daniel, who recently had a successful concert at the 02 Academy in Brixton, London, United Kingdom, is set to have another concert in Birmingham today (Saturday, May 21). Commenting on the outing, the Woju singer said, “After the London tour, I would still be on the road. I want to connect with my fans worldwide. A tour of the United States of America is next, to be followed by Africa, Australia and Europe.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
