The wife of kidnapped Labour Party’s candidate in the 2021 Anambra Governorship Election, Eucharia Agbasimalo, has appealed to Governor Charles Soludo for quick intervention in the matter. The LP candidate, Obiora Agbasimalo, who was abducted on September 18, 2021, during a political rally in Azia, Ihiala, Anambra State, has yet to be found. In a letter dated May 4, 2022, titled, ‘Abduction of Obiora Agbasimalo: A wife’s passionate appeal for help’, and addressed to Soludo, Mrs Agbasimalo pleaded with the governor to use his office and the resources within his powers to help the family find the missing man. She lamented that the entire family members, including the children, have been in trauma since the incident happened. She is seeking, among other things, that the governor prevail on security agencies to expedite actions to locate her husband and rescue him. The letter read in part, “On September 28, 2021, I received a distress call from one of my brothers in-law that my husband (Obiora), who was accompanying his sponsor (Oga Ndi Oga) for a function, has been kidnapped/abducted by unknown gunmen around Lilo, Azia, Ihiala.”
