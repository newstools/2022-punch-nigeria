Former Minister of Transportation and presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Rotimi Amaechi, has promised to fight insecurity and poverty in the country if elected President in 2023. Amaechi said this on Monday when he met with delegates of the All Progressives Congress in Katsina State as part of consultations for his presidential ambition. According to a statement signed by the Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi Media Office, the former governor of Rivers State lamented that Nigeria may disintegrate to the point where there could be a total divide between the rich and the poor. Amaechi was quoted as saying, “If Nigeria does not move back to agriculture and move from agriculture to industrial and manufacturing, the breakup you will see is the poor versus the rich. It will not be Muslims versus Christians or North versus South. It will be the poor versus the rich. So we must build the Nigerian economy to accommodate the poor. If you don’t accommodate the poor, you will run away. “Have you heard of Songhai farm? 300 hectares of Songhai farm, the biggest Songhai farm in the world was built by me. We built hostels for 500 farmers, when we train you and you graduate.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
