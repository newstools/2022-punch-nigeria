An auto crash on Friday evening claimed no fewer than eight lives. The incident happened at Akabo market on the ever- busy Owerri- Okigwe Road in Imo state. Eyewitnesses told our correspondent that the fatal accident was a head-on collusion between two vehicles coming in opposite directions. Our correspondent gathered that nobody survived from the two vehicles as the incident was very fatal. The crash was between an unmarked Hilux vehicle and a commercial vehicle popularly known as “Bus Imo.” One of the eyewitnesses, who identified herself as Chike Ibem said, ” it was a face-to-face accident between a Hilux vehicle and Bus Imo. It was fatal. Eight persons in the vehicles died on the spot. To be alive is a big miracle.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
