The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi has pledged to tackle insecurity as well as give priority to education if given the opportunity to serve as President in 2023. Amaechi made the pledge when he visited the Oba of Benin, Omo N’Oba N’Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Ewuare II in his palace in Benin City, Edo State capital, on Friday. The former Rivers State Governor said he has the experience to make the country better having been two-time Speaker of Rivers State Assembly and Chairman, Nigeria Speakers Forum. He said, “During my tenure as governor of Rivers State, these two were major focuses among others like transportation, roads and agriculture and I intend to replicate the same if given the opportunity to serve the country as president.” He promised that the coastal rail bill to commence from Lagos to Calabar, would pass through Benin, promising that there is another one from Onitsha, through Asaba to Benin which would see the light of the day as the contracts have near finalisation and awaiting adequate funds to commence. Responding, Oba Ewuare II, appealed to Amaechi not to forget his promise to the electorate if he gets the nod to serve as president. He described a situation where political office holders, especially governors, treat traditional rulers shabbily only to run to the same royal fathers during elections for support, adding that the youths should be catered for to eliminate violence during campaigns. The monarch said, “I appeal that when eventually you are successful, please do not forget the royal father and the young ones so that there will be less violence in politics.” Copyright PUNCH.
