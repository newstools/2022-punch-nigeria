The Godliness, Equity and Moderation Foundation on Monday distributed free pads to school students in Lagos State to mark this year’s World Menstrual Hygiene Day. Students from Easy Flow College, Meiran area of Lagos benefitted from the exercise which was done in conjunction with Baos Health Care Services. According to a statement made available to newsmen, the Chief Executive Officer, GEM Foundation, Jemima Akomaye, said about 100 pads were distributed to students of the school from 11 years and above. She said the foundation was birthed from a heart burdened with care for the girl child, adding that she had always sought a better means to reach out to them in their numbers. She said, “The foundation officially began on May 13, 2020. It started off as an online platform before we began operations offline. We have over 400 females on our online space and have reached out to over 200 offline. “Honestly, it hasn’t been a very easy and smooth ride. We have faced several challenges both online and offline, but the zeal and hunger to reach out to the girl child have kept us on our feet. “One major challenge we have and still experiencing is financial stability. It has really been difficult getting sponsors. Hence, we have been funding it from our personal accounts.” She added that the distribution was simply captivating “as we could see ourselves fulfilling dream and purpose.” Akomaye called the Lagos State Government and spirited individuals with the same drive to come to the aid of the foundation in its bid to put smiles on the face of the girl child.
