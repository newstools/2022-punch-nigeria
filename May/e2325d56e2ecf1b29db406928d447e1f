One person has been killed in an auto accident at Rainbow Roundabout in Gombe State. It was learnt that the incident occurred when a motorcycle, popularly known as Achaba, conveying a passenger collided with a trailer during a storm on Thursday. Residents scampered for safety during the storm because they thought it would rain. However, the situation which lasted for about 30 minutes, caused pandemonium among motorists as some used their headlamps to avert any accident. The state sector command of the Federal Road Safety Corps confirmed the incident on Friday. The command’s spokesperson, Janet Kassa, described the accident as a sad occurrence. Kassa said that the corpse had been deposited at the Specialist Hospital morgue for proper identification before internment. She also called on passengers to continue to abide by safety measures, warning that the command would not condone reckless driving. She said, “I have confirmed that only one person died on the spot and not three. One person died on the spot. It involved a trailer and motorcyclist and his passenger at the Rainbow Roundabout. The two survivors are receiving treatment as they sustained varying degrees of injury.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
