A shuttle bus was attacked by suspected Fulani herdsmen along Okigwe – Uturu Road, a few metres away from Abia State University, Uturu. It was confirmed that the shuttle bus driver was shut dead. This comes two days after seven students of Abia State University were kidnapped along the same route. A report indicated that students of ABSU are being kidnapped on a daily basis on that route by clearly identified Fulani Herdsmen. The report stated, “Lecturers and students are being kidnapped almost everyday along that road and both Abia and Imo State Governments have done nothing. “If your child is in Abia State university, he or she is no longer safe. The governments are all after party primaries now”. Details later… Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
