The Edo State Police Command has said it foiled an attempt to kidnap an expatriate at Okomu Oil Plantation in Ovia North East Local Government Area of the state. In a press statement on Saturday by the Command spokesperson, SP Bello Kontongs, the police engaged the suspected kidnapper in a gun duel, arresting some of the abductors, while others escaped with bullet wounds. The statement read, “Operatives of the Edo State Police Command Intelligence Rapid Response Squad got credible information on plans of notorious kidnappers to abduct an expatriate in Okomu Oil Plantation in Ovia North East LGA, Edo State. “On receipt of the information, the operatives, led by the commander, Intelligence Response Squad, swiftly swung into action and mobilised to the location. “The suspected kidnappers on sighting the team of Operatives opened fire on them. In the ensuing gun duel, the Operatives neutralised five of the suspected kidnappers while others escaped with gunshot injuries, while one AK 47, one single barrel cut to size gun, one long barrel gun and eight live cartridges were recovered from them. Rigorous bush combing to track other fleeing gang members for possible arrest is ongoing,” he added. Kontongs also said that the Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro, while thanking the public for prompt information which eventually led to the neutralising of the criminal elements, reinstated his commitment to the protection of residents of the state.
