…Case adjourned to May 23 Detained governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party in Rivers State, Farah Dagogo, was absent in court on Monday at the resumption of the case. Dagogo’s lawyer, Femi Adegbite, had applied for motion on bail at the Magistrates Court, but was opposed by the prosecution counsel. When the matter was called by Chief Magistrates Amadi Nna, he was informed by the lawyer to the Rivers State Government, Chidi Eke, that fresh information has been filed at the State High Court. The police did not give any reason for the absence of Dagogo who represents Degema-Bonny Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, and Chief Magistrates Nna adjourned the case to May 23 for mention.
