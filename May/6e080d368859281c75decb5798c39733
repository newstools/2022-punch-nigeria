A governorship aspirant under the platform of All Progressives Congress in Abia State, Chief Daniel Eke, on Saturday, said he had a contract “to serve” the Abia people. Addressing supporters in Umuahia, the Igbere in Ohafia LGA-born Eke summed up that his readiness to serve will be to reclaim, restore and modernize the state. Eke said he has the “attributes, character, integrity, and experience” needed to elevate the state. “Our people have been shut out and divided for a long time. I am applying to be your governor because I believe that the time has come for the state to experience and enjoy leadership through excellent services.” He assured the supporters and people of the state that when elected, he will deliver dividends of democracy to all Abians. Eke said “Abia First” mantra would impact Abians through reclamation of the commercial city of Aba, security, education, road infrastructure, healthcare, social services, and grassroots empowerment. Others, he said, include environmental control, energy infrastructure, and enhanced welfare of traditional rulers and the Ministry of Youth Affairs. “We shall use realities on the ground to identify the challenges that need to be surmounted in order to achieve the changes that we will deploy to transform the state.” Responding, the state party chairman of APC, Hon. Acho Obioma assured Eke of a level playground for all aspirants. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
