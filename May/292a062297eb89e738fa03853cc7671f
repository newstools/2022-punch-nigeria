Wema Bank has said that it will ensure data confidentiality of its customers. It said in a statement that its attention had been drawn to recent reports of members of the public receiving text messages with account numbers. The bank said, “We implore members of the public that, as a financial institution, Wema Bank takes issues around data integrity and breaches seriously, and we are currently investigating the reports. “Recently, we embarked on a massive activation campaign in the month and wish to state that all accounts opened are valid and fit for use. “We would like to reassure our customers that we keep all customer data confidential. Do note, however, that no account can be activated except by the owner of the account, when the person downloads the app and proceeds with account confirmation. “Again, we implore everyone to keep their personal details safe as scammers are on the prowl and would use all opportunities to defraud customers.” Where customers think their data may have been compromised, the bank urged them to change all their passwords and PINs immediately. “We want to assure all our customers that your financial transactions remain safe and secure with Wema Bank,” it said.
