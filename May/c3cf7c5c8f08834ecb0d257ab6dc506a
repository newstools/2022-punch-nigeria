The Youth Wing of the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union has tasked delegates of the Peoples Democratic Party in its region to shun monetary inducement as they decide who become their flagbearers come 2023 general election. The Union stated this in a press statement signed by its national coordinator, Comrade John Isaac, and issued to newsmen in Kaduna on Sunday. According to him, the Southern Kaduna region has gone through turbulent times in recent years with scores killed, properties destroyed, and economic activities relegated to the background. “These unfortunate happenings are undoubtedly tied to the poor quality of our choices, but particularly as it concerns elections. “It is on this backdrop that the youths are calling on all Southern Kaduna delegates taking part in the forthcoming primary elections starting today, May 22, 2022, across all political parties, to endeavor to vote for candidates with their overall interest, capable of attracting developments and empowering women and youths. “It is important to remind us that Southern Kaduna is the only home we all can call ours and must come first in all our dealings,” SOKAPU cautioned. “Delegates must know that the choices before them are clear, they must not mortgage the future of Southern Kaduna on the basis of who has given them cars or motorcycles and they must not sale their votes to the highest bidder,” the group cautioned.
