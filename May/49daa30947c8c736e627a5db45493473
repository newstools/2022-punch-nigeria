A victim of human trafficking, Adebisi Comfort, has shared her experience of living in Lebanon for eight months. She narrates how she and others were kept in a room called “office” where they were denied food, assaulted and dehumanised before being sent out to work as home helps in different households. Adebisi, who made the viral video showing over 10 girls locked up in a room also shared the last experience that made her run to the Nigerian embassy in Lebanon. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
