Napoli manager Luciano Spalletti has backed Nigeria international Victor Osimhen to score more goals for the club next season. Osimhen was recently named the Best Young Player of the 2021/22 Serie A season, beating the likes of Juventus’ Dusan Vlahovic, Leao of AC Milan and Sassuolo’s duo Gianluca Scamacca and Giacomo Raspadori to the prestigious award despite scoring fewer goals. Osimhen claimed the award despite missing a chunk of the season through injuries and other health-related issues but managed to score 14 goals and had five assists in what was his second season with the Italian outfit. In an interview published by TuttoNapoli, Spalletti admitted that the Nigerian was highly missed while out with injury, but is in no doubt that he will score more goals. “Yes, we discovered some things that unfortunately this year due to too many injuries, due to the need for him to work with the team on the details,” Spalleti said “For example, he went from hole to hole, but if you raise it to him, he has a level above normal. “Having him available immediately is a big advantage for him and the team; I am convinced that he will continue to score many goals, and he will increase his quality in finishing.” Osimhen has been linked with Manchester United and Newcastle United in the past few weeks and recent reports suggest that Arsenal have tabled a significant bid for the 23-year-old. Napoli have, however, rejected the offer as it was below the €110m Il Partenopei are demanding for their Nigerian import.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
