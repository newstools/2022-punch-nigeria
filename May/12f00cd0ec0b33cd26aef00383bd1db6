The monkeypox situation report released on Sunday night by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control revealed that no fewer than 66 suspected cases of monkeypox disease have been reported in Nigeria. The agency also noted that while 21 had been confirmed, only a single death had been reported. The PUNCH reports that monkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the Monkeypox virus which belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus in the family Poxviridae. The disease, according to the World Health Organization, is endemic to West and Central African countries. However, it has surfaced in other parts of the world such as the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Italy among others. “A total of 66 suspected cases have been reported between January 1st to May 29th, 2022. Of the suspected cases, 21 were confirmed from nine (9) states – Adamawa (5), Lagos (4), Cross River (2), FCT (2), Kano (2), Delta (2), Bayelsa (2), River (1) and Imo (1) – with 1 death recorded. This was in a 40yrs man with renal co-morbidity and on immune-suppressive drugs. “The twenty (20) new suspected cases in May 2022 were reported from 11 states – Lagos (5), Bayelsa (2), Adamawa (2), Rivers (2), Niger (2), FCT (2), Delta (1), Oyo (1), Kaduna (1), Edo (1) and Gombe (1). “This is a 100% increase in case reporting as compared with April 2022, when 10 new cases were reported, and is likely due to ongoing efforts to increase awareness and improve surveillance. “The six (6) new confirmed positive cases (out of the 20 suspected cases) in May 2022 were confirmed from four (4) states – Bayelsa (2), Adamawa (2), Lagos (1), and Rivers (1),” the agency stated. The PUNCH reports that from September 2017 to May 29th, 2022, a total of 578 suspected cases have been reported from 32 states in the country. The NCDC noted that it had activated the National Multisectoral Emergency Operations Centre at level 2. “This EOC will continue to coordinate ongoing response activities in the country while contributing to the global response.” Copyright PUNCH.
