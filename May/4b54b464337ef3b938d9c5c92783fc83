The Governor of the Central Bank, Mr Godwin Emefiele, says has not taken the decision to run for president in 2023. He, however, said God would direct him on issues relating to the 2023 presidency in the “next few days”. The CBN governor also noted that he won’t depend on proxies to buy Expression of Interest and Nomination forms if he decides to contest. The PUNCH had reported that some groups, including farmers, purchased the presidential nomination form of the All Progressives Congress for the CBN governor. He said this in a series of tweets on Saturday. The CBN governor had come under heavy criticism over the All Progressives Congress’ Presidential Expression of Interest and Nomination forms reportedly obtained for him by farmers and friends. He said, “I am humbled by the growing interest of those asking that I run for the Office of President in the 2023 general elections: I have not come to that decision. I note and salute the sacrifices of those farmers and patriots going as far as raising personal funds and offering me Presidential Nomination Forms: I thank them most profusely. “However, Should I answer their calls and decide to seek presidential nomination, I will use my own hard-earned savings from over 35 years of banking leadership to buy my own Nomination Forms,
without proxies in an open and transparent manner in full compliance with the laws and Constitution of The Federal Republic of Nigeria. “And should I not run for elected office, I will continue to serve and sacrifice for the good people of Nigeria under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari. This is a serious decision that requires God’s Divine intervention: in the next few days The Almighty will so direct.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
