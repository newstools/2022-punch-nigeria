The Lagos State Government has handed over keys and documents of houses at the Babatunde Olushola Benson Estate, Ibeshe, and LagosHOMS Sangotedo Phase I Estate to new homeowners. According to a statement on Monday, the presentation was done by the state Commissioner for Housing, Mr Moruf Akinderu-Fatai. The commissioner was quoted as urging the new homeowners to ensure that the two government-owned properties are well preserved and properly maintained. “It is important to be mindful of the need to keep the various homes and the estate in good condition to fully achieve the goal of making Lagos a 21st Century Economy,” he said. The commissioner said the estate was equipped with state-of-the-art infrastructures such as good roads, drainages, water and sewage treatment plants to make life easier and convenient for all the new residents in line with the directives of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. “These facilities compare well with others in civilised parts of the world and are to make the dream of decent living come alive for Lagosians as pledged by the State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu,” the commissioner added. He disclosed that the state government has appointed qualified organisations that will serve as facility managers for the estates. The commissioner said, “It is now the responsibility of the new residents to cooperate with appointed government facility managers to keep the estates in workable condition and enhance the value of the residents’ investment in their new homes.”  Contact: theeditor@punchng.com Copyright PUNCH.
