The Ekiti State Government has started the prosecution of the owner and staff of a hotel allegedly used for sexual exploitation and abuse of children under 18 years. The state Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Olawale Fapohunda (SAN), said apart from the criminal prosecution, his office would initiate civil suits against the hotel. Fapohunda, in a tweet on Sunday, said, “While the state government is committed to removing all obstacles to doing business in Ekiti State, this cannot be at the expense of the welfare of our children. “We have commenced the prosecution of the owner and staff of the first of the four hotels we have identified, whose facilities are being used for the sexual exploitation and abuse of minors. This criminal prosecution is without prejudice to the civil suits my office will further initiate on behalf of the child victims. “I have previously issued an advisory to hotel owners that they owe a duty of care to protect children on their property from sexual abuse. Their operations cannot simply be about making profits. “Where hotel staff have direct knowledge of the age of a child who is obviously in the hotel for the purpose of abuse, the hotelier will be criminally liable.”  Copyright PUNCH.
