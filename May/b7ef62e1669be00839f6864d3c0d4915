A former member of the National Assembly, Magnus Abe, on Thursday, said only the National Leader of All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, can deliver the presidency for the ruling party in 2023. Abe stated this during a meeting with party stakeholders at the inauguration of Bola Ahmed Tinubu Vanguard at the Captain Elechi Amadi Polytechnic in Port Harcourt. Abe, who represented the Rivers South-East Senatorial District, said for the ruling party to retain power after the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), only the former Lagos State governor can get the job done. “Tinubu is the only man that can deliver the killer punch that will make the APC to remain in power after President Muhammadu Buhari leaves. “Whether Tinubu wins the APC ticket or not, I will contest the governorship of Rivers State and still stand a chance of winning. We must choose the APC candidate that will deliver the APC in Rivers State,” he stated. Abe, however, added that he will continue to support the party irrespective of whoever emerges as the APC’s flagbearer to contest the presidential election. “The reason I am supporting him is simple. I looked at all who want to run, who claim they have done this and that and I saw that Asiwaju is the person in APC that can deliver. “I was not being sentimental, he did not tell me he was going to support me, no. I support him because I want the party to win.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
