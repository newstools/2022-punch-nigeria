The Edo State Police Command has refuted social media reports that 50 kids who were going for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination in Benin were kidnapped. The state command’s spokesperson, SP Bello Kontongs, urged the public to disregard the report, which he described as misleading. He stated, “The Edo State Police Command has been alerted to a misleading report making the rounds on social media, alleging that over 50 schoolchildren on their way to write UTME in Okada, Ovia North-East were kidnapped by herdsmen and this has caused confusion in the state. “It is important to state that the command under the leadership of CP Abutu Yaro has not recorded such incident in Benin or anywhere else in Edo State. “The command, therefore, wishes to inform the general public that the viral report making the rounds is not only misleading but capable of creating panic and an attempt by the authors to paint the police and other sister security agencies in bad light. “To this end, the CP appealed the general public to be calm as the command under his watch will continue to ensure the safety of residence.”  Copyright PUNCH.
