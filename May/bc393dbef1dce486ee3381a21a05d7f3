A House of Representatives hopeful, Ayoade Rasheed Adegboyega, popularly known as ARA, has obtained the Expression of Interest and Nomination forms in readiness for the party’s primary slated to hold in May. The forms were picked by Adegboyega at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja alongside his teeming supporters. Adegboyega was also an aspirant in the 2019 general election. While addressing journalists after picking up the nomination form, the philanthropist expressed his desire to represent the people of the Oluyole Federal Constituency. He said, “I greatly appreciate the immense love you showered on me during the last election to date. Your encouragement is the power to my elbows, and you are the wind beneath my wings. Your overwhelming support played a huge role in giving me the nudge I needed to take this bold step. It is for this reason that I have decided to make it official. “I believe strongly in the old saying that the best way to predict the future is to create it. “I have come with my sleeves rolled up, ready to work hand in hand with you, to create a future we will all be proud of. With your support, I hereby submit myself to serve you.”
