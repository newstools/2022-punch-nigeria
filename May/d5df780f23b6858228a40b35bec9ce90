About 500 members of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Ayedaade Local Government Area of Osun State have defected to All Progressives Congress. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Ismail Omipidan, obtained on Monday, said the defectors attributed their decision to dump the PDP to modest achievements that Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has recorded since coming on board. The defectors were said to be members of five different PDP groups within the local government area. Speaking on behalf of the defectors, Raufu Lukman, explained that they decided to join the ruling party because Oyetola’s administration had performed well in office. He said, “As you can see, we are here today in large number to confidently denounce our membership from the PDP and as well announce to the whole world that we are in the APC, the party that means well for the masses. “Our decision to leave the former party at this critical time is an indication of the fact that the present administration under the leadership of Governor Oyetola has performed creditably well in all the sectors of the economy and we are bent to contribute our own quota to collectively advance our state for the good and betterment of the citizenry. “My colleagues and I who are members of the defecting groups running to 500 to 550 members are resolute to work collectively with others to ensure all-round victory for the party.” The Osun State Commissioner for Finance, Bola Oyebamiji, while receiving the defectors, commended them for taking a bold step to join the APC.
