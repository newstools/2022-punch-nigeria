A Senate aspirant in the just concluded All Progressives Congress Senatorial primary in Kogi Central, Ramatu Shehu, has rejected the result of the exercise in which the former Kogi State Commissioner for Works, Abubakar Ohere, emerged the winner. She described the process as ‘kangaroo’ and in flagrant disregard for Electoral Law because a political appointee, Yahaya Karaku, was the returning officer, which was against the Electoral Act making it unlawful and unconstitutional. Yusuf Adeko, who addressed journalists on behalf of Shehu in Lokoja on Tuesday, said the election could not stand and urged the APC to be prepared to conduct a new primary. She described the activities of the Congress as “a selection and not an election”, adding that what “happened at the venue of the primary election was what was obtained in the animal farm”. “No accreditation was held. She was never allowed to meet with the delegates, while the retuning officer, Alhaji Yahaya Karaku, a political actor from the district, did not allow a level playing field by not allowing grey areas to be addressed before proceeding with the Kangaroo election,” Adeko stated. She called on her teeming supporters to remain calm despite the obvious manipulation, asked for a level playing field and to allow the people to choose their preferred candidate. Shehu estimated that no primary election was held in Kogi Central, adding that the results published on social media and other news outlets were fictitious and laughable with imaginary votes allocated.
