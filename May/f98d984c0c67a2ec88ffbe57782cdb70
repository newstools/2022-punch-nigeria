Embattled Nigerian midfielder Kelechi Nwakali on Tuesday bid an emotional goodbye to Huesca fans following a fallout with the Spanish club, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The former Arsenal player became a free agent after Huesca terminated his contract last month. Nwakali, who was named FIFA U-17 World Cup Player of The Tournament in Chile in 2015, joined the Oscenses Azulgranas in 2019, following an unsuccessful spell in England with Arsenal. Prior to the Africa Cup of Nations in January, the 23-year-old Nwakali was one of (manager) Xisco’s (Munoz) key players, starting each of the club’s four games before his departure. But since his arrival, the player was not considered for action after a row with the club for rejoining them  10 days late and was consequently  suspended by the Spanish Segunda Division club. A month after his contract was terminated, Nwakali took to Twitter to appreciate fans of the club. “I never really got the chance to say goodbye to the fans that supported me during my time at Huesca, I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart,” Nwakali wrote. “To the staff and teammates who I shared some special memories with, I also want to thank you and wish you all the best.” Nwakali is currently without a club but there have been reports linking the player with a move to join 28-time Primeira Liga champions Porto.
