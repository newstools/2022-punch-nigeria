Fatima Abdullahi, a former wife of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Abdullahi Adamu, has obtained the APC gubernatorial nomination and expression of interest forms to take over the seat of power in Nasarawa State. She would be challenging Governor Abdullahi Sule at the party’s primary election, slated to hold later this month. Speaking while consulting the APC leaders at the party’s secretariat in Lafia on Friday, Abdullahi explained that she decided to contest the governorship seat in 2023 in order to correct the wrongs being done by the present administration. She said, “Nasarawa state is in need of a visionary, purposeful, and competent leader who would be able to take the state to a greater height. “My aspiration was borne out of my sincere concern for our dear state because we need a leader who would build the economy of the state and ensure stability in all sectors so that we can fulfill the dreams of our founding fathers and I am that person to bring the needed change. “In the last decade, I have been able to access the potentials of the state and I have seen reasons why I have to partake in the building of our dear Nasarawa state. “Our teeming youths are dying in abject poverty due to lack of proper planning to engage them in governance. If elected into office, I would assemble the best minds to run an all-inclusive government in order to ensure the speedy growth of the state. “So, I am here to appeal to you all, to support my governorship ambition by voting for me during the party’s primary election so that I will emerge as the flag bearer for the 2023 gubernatorial election.” Copyright PUNCH.
