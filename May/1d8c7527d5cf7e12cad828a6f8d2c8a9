Oral Roberts University, Oklahoma, has awarded the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian of Church, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, with an honorary doctorate degree. In a video shared on his Instgram page, Adeboye was awarded ‘Doctor of Divinity’ for his distinguish service in spiritual leadership. Adeboye said he never expected that he would receive such an award from a “prestigious” university. Sharing a clip from the ceremony on his Instagram page, Adeboye wrote, “I recall that day in 1979 when I accompanied my father: Pa Josiah Akindayomi to Tulsa Oklahoma to attend Kenneth Haggins camp meeting and how the power of God moved mightily. “If anyone had told me then that I would be awarded an Honorary degree from one of the most prestigious Universities there: Oral Roberts University, I would have said the person was joking. But looking back and seeing what God as done so far, I cant but just say thank you Jesus. “My sincere appreciation to the Leadership of the University, God bless you.” Copyright PUNCH.
