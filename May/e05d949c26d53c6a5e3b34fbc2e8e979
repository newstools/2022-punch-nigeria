Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has tasked Muslims in the state to use the opportunity of the 2022 Sallah to pray for the sustenance of peace and security in the state and the country. In his Sallah message to the Muslims, Ikpeazu charged them to make the lessons of Ramadan a permanent part of their lives. Ikpeazu noted that Ramadan was synonymous with the lessons of sacrifice, forbearance, tolerance, self-control, love for others, and peace, which were critical elements required for a united and peaceful life. While congratulating them on the successful completion of the Ramadan fasting period which is one of the pillars of the Islamic Religion, he assured them, as well as adherents of all religions, that his administration shall continue to uphold the rights to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion of all citizens, provided that such rights would be exercised lawfully. He appreciated them for maintaining peaceful and harmonious coexistence and for living up to their civic responsibilities as citizens. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
