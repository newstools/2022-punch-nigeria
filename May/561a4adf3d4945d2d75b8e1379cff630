FairMoney MFB, the leading credit-led digital bank, has announced the launch of a new product designed to conveniently meet the savings needs of its customers. FairSave is a product that instantly rewards customers for saving their money on the FairMoney app. The move comes as a response to the growing demand from Nigerians for a more flexible savings platform that gives them full control of their money while seeing it grow.  FairSave is a FairMoney MFB savings wallet that allows its users to save money and accumulate interest daily. With FairSave, users get up to 10% interest Per Annum on their savings. Unlike other platforms, users can withdraw their interest and principal anytime they feel like without penalties. Asides from being safe, secured and guaranteed, saving with FairSave also helps you build a high credit score which helps increase your chances of getting higher loans at lower interest rates. According to the CEO, Laurin Hainy, “Nigeria is a booming market with a young population, without the right inclusive infrastructure set to serve them and help them grow their finance, there will forever remain a lag. Thus, why are we moving forward to provide an avenue where all our customers with aspirations and dreams are propelled to their dreams by learning a savings culture, built on flexibility and instant interests”.  As a market leader in digital banking and loan acquisition, FairMoney has been providing fair banking by offering business people, traders, students, artisans and many others loans with low interest rates, flexible payment plan and extensive payment duration as well as other banking services. As at December 2021, Fair Money had disbursed over ₦117 million in loans to Nigerians. With the launch of its FairSave platform, the company knows it will change the lives of many people out there by rewarding them for saving. To reach out to as many people as possible, the company recently unveiled reality star and entrepreneur, Anita Natacha Akide, famously known as Tacha as its brand ambassador. With Tacha as a partner, FairMoney hopes to increase awareness of its Fintech products and services, drive financial education and close the financial inclusion gap.
