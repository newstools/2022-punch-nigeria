The Lagos State Public Service Office has organised an induction for 76 new officers comprising 53 administrative and human resource officers, 17 executive officers and six officers on transfer of service to the mainstream civil service. The training is expected to keep officers abreast of civil service matters, expectations on conversion or transfer of service and provision of essential information about their new career paths. Present at the induction was the Lagos State Head of Service, Mr Hakeem Muri-Okunola, who was represented by the Director, Service Matters, Office of Head of Service, Mrs Sunkanmi Oyegbola. A statement on Monday quoted Muri-Okunola as saying, “Every officer is expected to be conversant with the tenets of the civil service rules, financial regulations, performance as an administrative and human resource officer, human resource management in the public service, the five divisions in human resource management, various guidelines on administrative procedures in the civil service, report writing submission and effective communication in the civil service as well as the preparation of personnel budget.” The Head of Service enjoined the officers to fully participate in the various discussions and deliberations as this would help in their new postings. In his remarks, the Director, Welfare Matters, Office of the Head of Service, Mr Richard Ogbe, said the inductees must be conversant with memo and report writing, and submissions, and must be able to communicate effectively.
