A member of the National Assembly representing Ekiti Central Senatorial District, Opeyemi Bamidele, has submitted his Expression of Interest and Nomination forms for All Progressive Congress for his re-election. The Chairman, Senate Committee on Judiciary Human Rights and Legal Matters, filed his submission on Monday in Abuja. In a statement issued by his Media Office, Bamidele pledged to attract more dividends of democracy to the people of Ekiti Central if re-elected as a member of the red chamber. He also thanked the leadership of the APC in Ekiti State and party members for their continuous support towards his re-election. The statement partly read, “Today, Senator Michael Opeyemi Bamidele submitted his nomination and expression of interest forms at the International Conference Centr, Abuja. “Bamidele, after submitting the nomination and expression of interest form, appreciated the leadership of the All Progressives Congress in Ekiti State and members of the party for their continuous support towards his re-election to the Red Chamber in 2023.” The PUNCH had earlier reported that Opeyemi joined the governorship race of the ruling party in Ekiti earlier in the year but lost out at the primary won by a former Secretary to the Ekiti State Government, Biodun Oyebanji.
