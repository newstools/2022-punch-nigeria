Following a remarkable 2021/22 season with Leicester City, Brendan Rodgers is keen to tie up a permanent deal for Nigeria international Ademola Lookman, who is on a season-long loan deal from RB Leipzig. According to transfermarkt, Lookman is currently valued at €9m but should Leicester decide to sign him on a permanent, Daily Mail reported that he would cost the Foxes €14m. Lookman has made 40 appearances across all competitions and contributed to 13 goals (eight goals and five assists). With the season drawing to a close, Rodgers, who according to Daily Mail is in the market for central defence, central midfield and right wing, said he had been left impressed with the Nigerian’s performance during his loan spell with the club and would love to keep him. “He is a young player I really like and he has done very well in his time here,” Rodgers was quoted as saying by Daily Mail. “We will discuss that over the coming weeks and if it’s possible I’d love to be able to do something because I think there is still growth in him. “We just have to wait and see from a financial perspective if that’s something we can do. He gives us real healthy competition and challenges (Harvey) Barnes in that left-sided position because that’s where he’s at his best. He is the type of player that of course I’d like to have.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
