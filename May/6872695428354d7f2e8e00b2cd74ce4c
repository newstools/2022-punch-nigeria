Popular Nollywood actress, Nse Ikpe-Etim, has revealed that she wasn’t ashamed that she couldn’t bear children. She said this in an interview with media personality, Chude Jideonwo, where she spoke about her personal life. The actress had in 2019 revealed that she had to undergo hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) after she was diagnosed with a disease. Speaking about how her inability to have a child made her feel, she said she didn’t feel shame, that she only felt inadequate. The 47-year-old said, “I felt inadequate as a woman but I’m not ashamed. That’s the least that I would be because I can’t. “It was tied to how I was brought up. We don’t ties shame to ourselves. We live through life fully.” She also added that her husband, Clifford Sule, has supported her throughout the journey because it was what he was meant to do. “It’s us, we walk in there as a partnership. We’re faced with the good, bad, and ugly,” Nse said. When asked if she was open to adoption, the actress said, “You never say never, but right now, my husband and I are just dog parents.” Nse got married to her childhood sweetheart, Clifford Sule, in 2013.
