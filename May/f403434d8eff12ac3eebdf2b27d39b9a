Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, on Tuesday breezed into the national secretariat of the All Progressives Congress in Abuja. Abiodun was warmly received by the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, who subsequently ushered him in for a closed-door meeting. Efforts made to speak with the governor after the one-hour meeting proved abortive as he ignored journalists, quietly entered his car, and left the premises. The embattled governor is currently enmeshed in a scandal over his alleged criminal records in the United States of America. He is also at loggerheads with party members and delegates who petitioned the leadership of the party over their demand for direct election in the state. A petition was equally written against him to the Economic and Financial Crime Commission and Adamu by the leadership of the National Association of Nigerian Students (Zone D). The petition, which was jointly signed by Victor C. Ezenagu and Chuks Okafor NANS Public Relations Officer and Senate President respectively, called for prosecution and disqualification of the governor from running for a second term in office.
