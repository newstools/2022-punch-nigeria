The Youth Wing of the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union has called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to establish Southern Kaduna Development Commission that would reconstruct, rehabilitate and resettle over two million displaced persons in almost 200 communities. The group stated this in a statement signed by its National Leader, John Isaac, and issued to journalists in Kaduna State on Wednesday. The union noted that the Southern Kaduna Development Commission was paramount and should be supported by peace-loving Nigerians. While commenting on the 2023 general elections, the group vowed to support only aspirants that have shown empathy and support during the travails of their people. It also noted that the region would be a no go area for aspirants who have no human feelings, regard for human lives and have shown little or no concerns and empathy for the region. SOKAPU explained that the region in the last seven years witnessed an unprecedented number of attacks, with thousands killed and slaughtered in cold blood, properties worth billions of naira destroyed and millions displaced. “While we appreciate the generosity of some of the aspirants towards ameliorating the living conditions of displaced persons in the state, we will like to call on all aspirants across all political parties to emulate the kind gestures of those who have extended support to the people of Southern Kaduna and Kaduna state at large. “We also want to categorically emphasise that more needs to be done in the areas of rehabilitation and reconstruction of sacked communities in Southern Kaduna as the Southern People are passing through untold hardship.” Copyright PUNCH.
