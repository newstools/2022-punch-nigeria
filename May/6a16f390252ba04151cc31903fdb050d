One of the scariest things about scams is that it looks too good to be true. Let me tell you a story: Sometime in December 2021, I joined Telegram Group where they trade crypto via Peer-to-Peer. About 30,000+ people were in that group. And all transactions were made public in the group. As no one is supposed to private chat to transact for risk of being defrauded. Hence, all transactions were supervised by an Escrow ( An escrow is a middleman who ensures transactions goes through seamlessly) who provided his account number where the naira would be paid and held till the seller paid the buyer the  USDT to your wallet. Imagine negotiating 1 USDT for 470 naira – the rate of our dreams, considering our present circumstances. I requested the naira equivalent of $50, and found a seller who gave me 510 to a dollar. I negotiated for 490 and he agreed. We informed the escrow of the group, and he provided his account number. I paid the equivalent of $50 at the rate of 460 per $1. I Sent my receipt to the group. The Seller acknowledged it, so I sent my USDT wallet. After that, I was removed from the group and never got my USDT. I tried to private chat with the “Escrow” and he sent this message “Lol e clear” and blocked me. It dawned on me that I had been scammed. It took me a while to beat myself to reality. I have since forgiven myself. I searched crypto on Telegram and saw some crypto robots with different kinds of scam offerings.
