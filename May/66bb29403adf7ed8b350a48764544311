The Lagos State Government has said it is committed to the welfare of pensioners in the state. The Chairman of the Local Government Staff Pensions Board, Mr Kamal Baiyewu, disclosed this on Thursday during a welfare programme for pensioners in Ikeja GRA. He said, “This initiative was organised to bring all our pensioners together to ensure that they are in good health, physically active and intellectually alert through games and current affairs and socially interactive and these will ensure their longevity. “The administration of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu is deeply committed to the welfare of pensioners. We consulted the retirees and other stakeholders to ensure that this programme would be established and it will be held in all the five divisions of the state which are Badagry, Surulere, Epe, Ikorodu and Ikeja.” The Permanent Secretary, Local Government Establishments, Training and Pensions Office, Mrs Kikelomo Bolarinwa, noted that each division had 50 beneficiaries. “The programme is the first of its kind and it was aimed to enhance the well-being of pensioners. We have a total of 250 pensioners in all the five divisions of the state. “The participants here in Ikeja are 50 and in selecting them, we considered their proximity and we have more beneficiaries of the welfare scheme,” she said.
