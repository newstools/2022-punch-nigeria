The deputy Governor of Niger State, Ahmed Ketso, has lost the bid to pick the All Progressives Congress governorship ticket in the state. Ketso lost to a sitting member of the House of Representatives representing the Chanchaga Constituency, Mohammed Bago, on Friday. In the election that ran through the night, Bago beat nine other governorship aspirants to emerge victorious in the struggle for the party’s ticket. Announcing the results on Friday morning, Nasiru Ibrahim, a former Attorney General of Kebbi State, stated that 1,049 delegates were accredited to participate in the elections. Ibrahim said Bago got 540 votes to beat a newspaper practitioner who was his closest opponent who scored 386 votes. A former Minister of Sports, Mohammed Ndanusa, got 84 votes, while the Deputy Governor got 17 votes. Rufai Mohammed got four votes; Idris Makaranta, three votes; Mohammed Kutigi, one vote; Aliyu Idris, one vote; Mohammed Kpautagi, one vote; while a former Secretary to the Niger State Government, Yahaya Kuta, got zero vote. Nasiru, therefore, declared the House of Representatives member winner of the primary. “Hon. Bago has the highest votes in the elections held in Minna, Niger State. Therefore, I, Bar. Nasiru, as the chairman Electoral committee, declare Hon. Bago as the winner of the elections,” the chairman of the APC governorship primary stated. Valid votes were 571 while void votes were 11. In his acceptance speech, the winner, Mohammed Bago, while thanking God for the success of the elections, called on the party supporters to suspend celebration. “We are not yet there, we still have work ahead. It is my prayer that (the) APC forms the next government,” Bago said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
