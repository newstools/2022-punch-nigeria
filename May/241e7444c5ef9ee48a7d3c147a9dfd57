Praises continue to pour in for the in-form Alex Iwobi, with former Super Eagles head coach, Sunday Oliseh, the latest to hail the utility player, following his impressive display against Leicester City on Sunday. Iwobi played a crucial role as the Toffees claimed a 2-1 win away from home at the King Power Stadium as Frank Lampard’s men continued their fight for safety. The former Arsenal player made his eighth consecutive start in the league and was played as a right wing-back for the second straight game, having shone brightly in that position against Chelsea last week. Iwobi assisted Everton’s first goal for Ukrainian defender Vitaliy Mykolenko, as they took the lead just four minutes into the game. Defensively, the Nigerian was also solid as he put in great work to recover on many occasions. Left in awe of the Eagles players, Oliseh, who handed Iwobi his national team debut in a friendly game against DR Congo in 2015, took to his Twitter handle to praise the player. “Extremely impressed by Alex Iwobi’s performance Vs Leicester Today. Simple, clairvoyant, hard-working, tracking back, changing play, and dictating the tempo, especially at a time when his club’s survival in the 1er league is on the line. Kudos Lil Bro!!” Oliseh wrote. The result saw Everton move away from the bottom and currently occupy the 16th position with 35 points, one point ahead of Leeds United and Burnley, with a game in hand. Everton will face relegated Watford in their next league game on Wednesday.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
