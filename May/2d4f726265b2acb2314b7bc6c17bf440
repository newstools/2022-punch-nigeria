The Anambra State House of Assembly has expressed deep shock over the news of the gruesome murder of one of its members, Mr Okechukwu Okoye, by gunmen. Okoye was the member representing Aguata 2 Constituency. He was kidnapped last Sunday and was found beheaded with the head placed at a road side in Amichi community of the state late on Saturday. In a press statement after an indoor meeting on Sunday, the Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Uche Okafor, described the death of Okoye as unfortunate and heart breaking. Okafor, who described the late Okoye as one of the outspoken and articulated lawmakers, noted that the legislative institution in the state has lost a quality member. The Speaker commended Okoye’s sense of humour, hospitality and commitment to duty among other positive attributes, adding that his demise will really be felt in the House of Assembly. He urged Governor Chukwuma Soludo not to relent in his efforts towards achieving maximum security of lives and property of Ndi Anambra and called on well-meaning citizens to join hands with the governor in that direction. He commiserating with the late Okoye’s immediate family, his kinsman, Governor Soludo and the entire Isuofia community on behalf of the members of the State House of Assembly and the entire legislature. He enjoined them to take solace in the fact that the short but eventful life of the late Okoye was full of quality service to God and humanity. “We pray God to grant him eternal rest,” he added.
