The Lagos State Police Command, on Tuesday, said it arrested the alleged killer of the Chairman of the Ojodu-Berger Okada Riders Association, Mr Alaba Williams. The command spokesperson, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, confirmed the arrest to the News Agency of Nigeria on Tuesday. He said, “The alleged killer of Mr Alaba William, Chairman of the Ojodu-Berger Okada Riders Association, is in our custody. “Investigation into the case has commenced immediately. Peace has returned to the place. Some patrol teams have been deployed in the area to ensure peace.” It was reported that the chairman was stabbed to death on Monday at Kosoko Bus-stop in the Ojodu-Berger area of the state over collection of levy. Sources had earlier told NAN that Williams was stabbed in the neck by a colleague following an argument that ensued over payment of levy after the commercial motorcyclist dropped a passenger at the bus stop. “The chairman was rushed to a hospital where he was confirmed dead on arrival,” one of the sources said.
