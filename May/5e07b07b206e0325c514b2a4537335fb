A Jos-born Dutch , Wiebe Boer, has debunked rumours that he is a governorship aspirant in Plateau State in the 2023 elections. Boer, who is also the Chief Executive Officer of an energy firm, All On, raised the alarm that posters that he was running for the position under another name had gone viral. Debunking the posters, the inaugural CEO of the Tony Elumelu Foundation, in a post on his LinkedIn page, stated that he had no intention of running for any political office in Nigeria. In a LinkedIn post on Monday, he wrote, “It has come to my attention that posters implying that I am running for Governor of Plateau State under the name of Yohanna Maigona have gone viral. “I am categorically stating that I have no intention of running for political office in Nigeria, and I am not eligible to do so. “The only truth to the insinuation is that I was born in Jos and raised in Taraba and Plateau States to Dutch missionary parents and have spent the last 12 years living in Lagos and serving Nigeria and Nigerians in various capacities. “I have always been a staunch believer in the potential of Nigeria and will continue to support the country’s development from the sidelines.” Copyright PUNCH.
