A two-storey building on Chris Igadi Street, in the Ago Palace Way area of Lagos State, collapsed on Saturday. Our correspondent gathered that people residing in the building vacated the premises immediately after the building gave a sign it wanted to collapse. The Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, Dr. Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, said no casualty was recorded during the incident, adding that the site of the collapsed structure had been handed over to the Lagos State Building Control Agency. He said, “The agency responded to the collapsed two-story building on Chris Igadi Street, off Ago Palace Way, opposite Kilimanjaro/ AP filling station, around 3am this morning. “On arrival, information gathered from the residents revealed that the building gave signs several hours before it collapsed.
