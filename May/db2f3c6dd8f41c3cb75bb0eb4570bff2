May Edochie, wife of Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie, has made her return to social media following her silence after her husband married a second wife. In her comeback post on Tuesday, the mother-of-four stated that her family and her faith do not support polygamy, though it works for some people. She also thanked her fans for sticking by her during her “trying period”. Sharing a picture of herself, she said, “I sincerely want to appreciate everyone for the tremendous love, prayers and support from all over the world. “It has really been overwhelming. You have all been an incredible pillar of strength during this trying period.” She also added that the video shared by her husband earlier on Tuesday was an old one. Yul had shared a video of him and his wife vibing to a song in their car, where he also hailed her as his angel. May continued, “My phones are buzzing once again due to the OLD video trending online today. My family and faith ABSOLUTELY do NOT practice polygamy, although it works for some people. “God has blessed me with a beautiful and loving family. I need you all to continue to keep me and my family in your prayers. “May God bless you all abundantly for your love, prayers and support.” Yul Edochie caused a stir two weeks ago after announcing his second wife, Judy Austin, adding that she already had a son for him. May, his wife of 17 years, reacted to the post by calling on God’s judgement upon the couple. Since then, May had been silent on social media and had unfollowed her husband on Instagram.
