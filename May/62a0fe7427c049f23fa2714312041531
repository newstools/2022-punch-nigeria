The Africa Magic Viewers Choice Award was held in glamour and style last weekend, and it paraded an array of stars, who took turns to walk the red carpet and grant interviews in their glittering attire. Indeed, fashion, and not just art, was also celebrated at the event, which has been known to always play host to a lot of eye-popping outfits. As with past editions, some outfits were trailed by controversies this year too. Actress and a former Big Brother Naija contestant, Ifu Ennada, ruffled not a few feathers when she claimed that her ‘look’ was worth $100,000. The black dress, which was designed by Toyin Lawani of Tiannah Empire, featured several black masks, and it turned not a few heads on the red carpet. However, many fans called out Ennada, accusing her of overstating the cost of the dress. But, the ex-BBN contestant lambasted those who criticised the dress. Taking to her Instagram page, she wrote, “My entire look was worth over $100,000. So, if you don’t have a minimum of $10,000 in a domiciliary account, you have no right to speak on my look. Basically, stay away from criticizing my outfit if you are broke.” Meanwhile, another actress, Dorcas Shola-Fapson, aka Ms DSF, was called out by a stylist, Maklin Scout on Instagram, who claimed that she did not complete the payment for her dress to the AMVCA. He claimed that rather than pay him his complete fee, Fapson blocked him on social media. According to him, he made the dress in a day. Responding, the actress slammed the stylist for his comments. Sharing screenshots of the stylist apologising to her the day before he called her out, she claimed that he made a mess of the outfit and did not deliver it on time.  Copyright PUNCH.
