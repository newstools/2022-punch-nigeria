The Secretary, Committee of Vice-Chancellors of Nigerian Universities, Prof. Yakubu Ochefu, has said the 2022 admission processes for universities may be delayed due to the ongoing strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities. Ochefu stated this in an interview with The PUNCH on Thursday. According to the scribe, the committee is also working alongside the government to ensure that all issues are resolved. “The admission process may be delayed because of the strike and the disruption of the academic calendar.
We saw it happen in 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown and the 2020 ASUU strike as well. What most universities did then was to batch the admission process. “Vice-chancellors are critical stakeholders in the University eco-systems. They have always been part of the efforts to resolve labour-related matters with the proprietors. The Chairman and five other VCs are part of the advisory team that supports the government’s negotiation team.” The PUNCH had earlier reported that the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board had called on Universities and other institutions to fast track the 2021 admission processes so as not to cause disruptions for the 2022 admissions. So far, a total of 1,761,338 candidates registered for the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examinations and Direct Entry Examinations. While the strike by ASUU entered its 86th day, today [Thursday], the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics is scheduled to commence its two-week warning strike on Monday, May 16, 2022.
