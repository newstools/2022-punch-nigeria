Some residents of the Federal Capital Territory have taken to the streets to protest the tenure extension of six area councils’ chairmen and councillors. The PUNCH gathered that the chairmen and councillors’ terms in office elapsed on Thursday and the newly-elected officials were supposed to be sworn in today. But the FCT minister, Muhammad Bello, cited a court judgement and extended the officials’ tenure by one year. Displeased by the extension, residents in the Gwagwalada Area Council on Friday morning took to the streets. The residents, who barricaded the roads and made bonfires, are demanding a reversal of the decision. The incident, it was gathered, obstructed vehicular movements in the area.
