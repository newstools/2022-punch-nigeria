THE Lagos State Government has called on residents to work towards the maintenance of a cleaner environment after the Eid-el-Fitr festivities in the state. The Chief Executive Officer of Lagos Waste Management Authority,  Ibrahim Odumboni, made this call, according to a statement on Wednesday, adding that LAWMA’s sanitation workers and waste managers have been mandated to work relentlessly across the metropolis to ensure a filth-free state. He said, “In anticipation of an increase in waste generation during and after the celebration, we have intensified our operations, deploying our personnel at strategic points in the state, to clean the roads, highways, and markets, as well as facilitating clearance of black spots defacing the environment. “We know that during major festivities, more waste will be generated by residents and we are fully prepared to cart away the waste promptly. We are also working with the Ministry of the Environment, our supervisory ministry, and other stakeholders, to help us achieve our objectives.” Odumboni also urged residents to ensure prompt evacuation of waste and sort their wastes appropriately. “We urge residents to shun indiscriminate dumping of waste and embrace the culture of sorting and bagging of waste, especially animal waste, to avoid pollution of the environment and to facilitate easy evacuation. “Improper waste disposal at unauthorised locations such as drains, road medians, and canals, is a major challenge we are tackling, and we won’t rest on our oars until we realise our aim. So we are appealing to our people to bag their wastes and containerise them near their houses for easy evacuation by assigned Private Sector Participation operators,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
