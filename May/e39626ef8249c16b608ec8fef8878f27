The Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate in Anambra state, in the last governorship election, Valentine Ozigbo, has been disqualified from contesting the Senate seat in the 2023 National Assembly election on the platform of the party. Also disqualified from contesting the election are Chuma Nzeribe and Dr. Obinna Uzor. Some of those cleared are Chris Uba, Senator Stella Oduah and Senator Uche Ekwunife. In the report of the screening committee of the party for the 2023 National Assembly election in the state, dated April 27, 2022, obtained by journalists in Abuja on Sunday, nine aspirants contesting for Senate seat were screened, out of which six were cleared. For the House of Representatives, 49 aspirants were screened and all of them were cleared. In the report signed by the Chairman of the committee, Udeh Okoye, indicated that “he (Ozigbo) told the committee that he was awaiting the Supreme Court Judgment in SC/CV/240/2022 and SC/CV/241/2022.; that if Supreme Court annuls the election, he would become the governor. “On that basis, he concluded that there would be no need to submit the senatorial form within the specified time. “On April 27, 2022, the Supreme Court now upheld the contemplated litigation. Unfortunately, by the time he submitted the form, he was already out of time.’’ For Nzeribe, the committee said he was disqualified based on false information to the committee.  Copyright PUNCH.
