There was an unusually heavy security presence at the entrance and premises of the Federal High Court sitting in Osogbo on Wednesday. This is as Justice Nathaniel Ayo-Emmanuel is expected to rule on the suit challenging the eligibility of Senator Ademola Adeleke as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the July 16 Osun governorship poll. A chieftain of the party, Prince Dotun Babayemi, had approached the court, asking it to invalidate the primary election that produced Adeleke as the PDP candidate. At the entrance to the premises of the court, four Hilux vans belonging to the police were manned by heavily armed operatives. The operatives deployed also had a hectic time controlling heavy human movement into the court. Besides the courtroom that was filled up, many supporters of the two parties in the matter also sat outside the courtroom. As of the time of filing this report, Justice Ayo-Emmanuel had commenced reading his judgement. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
