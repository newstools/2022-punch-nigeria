Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has been selected among other dignitaries to speak at a national symposium. The series of the symposium is titled, “The state, the society and the church”, according to a statement by the organisers. Themed “Beacon of Hope”, the conference is being organised by the Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church, Surulere District, Ayo Ni O, to mark the 50th anniversary of the church’s wardens unit. The unit will mark its golden jubilee on May 7, 2022. Addressing journalists at a news conference in Lagos, the Chairman/General Leader of the Movement, Sunday Korode, said the second national symposium was meant to commemorate the occasion. Speaking on the unsavoury developments in the country, the church leader, who was represented by the District General Secretary, Pastor George Ogunleye, posited that the church, a not-for-profit organisation, is an integral part of the society and as such, could not be a passive participant in the society.
