Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has warned unsuspecting residents of the state against buying government acquired lands meant for dumpsite from land speculators, citing the future environmental and health implications to their well-being and the overriding public interest. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Environment and Chief Executive Officer of the Ogun State Waste Management Authority, Mr Ola Oresanya, gave the warning in the wake of encroachment of lands designated as dumping sites by the state government which were sold to some individuals by land speculators. Oresanya advised that before buying any land near any government-owned dumpsites, residents must contact the state’s Bureau of Lands and Survey, Ministry of Environment and OGWAMA to confirm their status. “A case that comes to mind is that of Saje Dumpsite in Abeokuta which was leased by the Ogun State government in July 2006 and falls within LUD Site IV Acquisition which was sold by land speculators to unsuspecting public. As of the time of its lease and subsequent acquisition, the dumpsite was an abandoned quarry of 18.43 hectares of land space. However, the dumpsite is now surrounded by residential houses as owners  were tricked by land speculators who sold the acquired land to them” “The residents are now disrupting the waste disposal efforts and management in Abeokuta claiming health and environment hazards in a place where they are not supposed to be in the first place as they saw the dumpsites in existence and in operation before they illegally fall victims to land speculators and build their houses near the dumpsites”  Copyright PUNCH.
