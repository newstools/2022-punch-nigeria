The Nigerian Air Force has postponed its 2022 NAF Day celebration billed to hold in Kano. Though the event was initially scheduled for Thursday, NAF authorities announced that the event will now hold on Saturday. NAF spokesperson, Edward Gabkwet, announced this in a terse statement without giving any specific reason for the postponement. The postponement was announced a few hours after an explosion occurred in Kano State, killing at least four persons. Gabkwet said, ”The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Day 2022 Celebration earlier scheduled to take place from 19-21 May 2022 at NAF Base, Kano has now been rescheduled to take place from 21- 23 May 2022 at the same venue. ”This was due to unforeseen circumstances. The NAF wishes to apologise to all its invited guests for the inconveniences the new shift in date may have caused them.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
