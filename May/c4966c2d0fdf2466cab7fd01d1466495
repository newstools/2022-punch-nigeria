The Executive Director of the Free Cleft and Craniofacial Surgery Programme, which is an arm of TY Danjuma Foundation, Dr Bello Seidu, has appealed to the authorities of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, to establish a School of Dentistry. He urged the management of LAUTECH Teaching Hospital, Ogbomoso, to create a Cleft and Craniofacial Unit in the hospital. According to a statement on Thursday, Seidu made the appeal during the commencement of the ongoing 25th free cleft and craniofacial surgery programme holding at the teaching hospital. He was quoted to have stated that facial deformity is a scourge whose effect is seriously downplayed in the society. The statement read in part, “Dr Seidu, while affirming that support was seriously needed from well-meaning individuals and corporate organisations to help build a befitting craniofacial centre, added that about N5m would be needed to buy standard craniofacial equipment.”
