Former candidate of the African Democratic Congress  in the 2020 Edo State governorship election, Mabel Oboh, on Friday, called on the state governor, Godwin Obaseki, to save the people of Esan land from the incessant attacks by Fulani herdsmen. Oboh, in a petition titled, “SOS, Save Esan from marauding Killer herdsmen. Do you agree?” said the call became necessary because the Esan people in  Ubiaja, Ugboha and other communities, in Esan South East Local Government Area of the state had been deprived of their livelihoods. She said, “The Esan people are being kidnapped, killed, and raped by herdsmen on a daily basis. Join us in our appeal to the Executive Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki to help save the innocent people of Esan land in Edo State.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
