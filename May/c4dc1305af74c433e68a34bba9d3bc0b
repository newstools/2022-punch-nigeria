Popular music producer and record label executive, Don Jazzy’s ex-wife, Michelle Jackson, has narrated how the former’s music career got in the way of their marriage. Speaking during an interview with Naija FM, Michelle noted that she and Don Jazzy met at the club without really seeing physically until their first date. She said, “We were in a club and at the time he was in a group called the Solex Crew. Together with a couple of his bandmates, they were handing out fliers. I eventually had a look at the flier and I saw this handsome tall guy on it. I had a friend who claimed to know him and asked if I wanted his number. He did not come over; it was his mobile phone and I typed my number on it. A couple of days later, he called and that’s pretty much it.” According to her, Don Jazzy was very committed to his music career at the time. She added, “He just needed to go and be himself and do his music. It (marriage) was a week after my 22nd birthday. We were very young.” Recall that in April 2021, Don Jazzy had taken to his Instagram page to inform his fans that he got married 18years ago. Describing Michelle as one with a good heart, he wrote, “Michelle is so beautiful inside and outside, with such a soft heart. But then, me being so young and full of dreams, I f**ked it up because I was giving all my time to my music.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
