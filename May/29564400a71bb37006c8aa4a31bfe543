Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, has said Nigeria’s potential would be maximised with honest leadership. This is as he restated the seriousness with which the President Muhammadu Buhari (retd.)’s regime is confronting the security challenges in the country, noting the results and outcomes of the keen efforts of the Federal Government are certainly underway. He spoke over the weekend at the Presidential Villa when he received a delegation from the Christ Apostolic Church, CAC led by its President, Pastor Samuel Oladele, at his Aguda residence on Saturday evening. “It’s a huge country and with the security challenges, we need to ramp up resources, men and equipment. We need to ramp up the numbers, use of technology, get more military platforms and arms and ammunition,” the VP stated, adding that all of these are now in progress. Explaining the situation further, he noted that at times, some of these things take some time. For instance, he recalled that the Federal Government ordered and fully paid over $469 million for the Tucano fighter jets about 4 years ago, but only got delivered last year. But he assured the clerics that “FG is already getting a handle on it. Now we are reconfiguring our security, local ammunition manufacturing is on the cards and a lot of work is going on. We pray we see some of the results soon.” He then affirmed that “our country has potential if we can keep having honest leadership. When I decided I will run for office, I thought, let’s even put our minds to it. I have seen it for 7 years and I know it can be done” Earlier in his remarks, the CAC President, Pastor Oladele while extending greetings and appreciation to President Muhammadu Buhari for his leadership, stated that he has always personally admired the President. “I have been a great admirer of the President since he was head of State and so we encourage him to do more for peace and prosperity of our country. We believe that all will be well with the nation.”
