Officers of the Rapid Response Squad have arrested two suspected traffic robbers in separate areas in Lagos. The suspects were nabbed around the Magodo Estate and Otedola Bridge areas in Lagos State. One suspect, Korede Saheed, 29, was arrested on Thursday, while the other suspect, Yahaya Faisal, 22, was arrested on Friday. Luck ran out on the suspects when their victims quickly reached out to the RRS officers on patrol in the area who arrested them and recovered one Samsung Galaxy S8 and one iPhone 12 from the suspects. Yahaya who was also found with different ATM cards confessed to the police that his gang robbed in traffic between Ojodu-Berger and Otedola Bridge. The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi, has directed the Commander, RRS, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi, to transfer the suspects and exhibit to the CP’s special squad for further investigation that would lead to the arrest of other fleeing gang members and their eventual prosecution.
