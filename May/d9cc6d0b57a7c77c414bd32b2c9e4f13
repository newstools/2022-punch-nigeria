Italian Serie A giants, Inter Milan, have identified Destiny Udogie as a potential replacement for Tottenham Hotspurs bound Ivan Perisic. Udogie was one of the revelations in the Italian league last season making 37 appearances for Udinese and scoring five goals. His impressive performance has caught many eyes with Juventus among the top European clubs interested in the defender of Nigerian descent. Reports confirmed that Tottenham are on the brink of completing the free transfer of the winger with the Croatian already in London to undergo a medical with the Premier League club. Preparing for life after the player, Tuttomercatoweb reported that the Nerazzurri have listed the youngster, who is valued at around €15m, among other players as a replacement for Perisic. “The farewell of Ivan Perisic at Inter, with the Croatian who is carrying out medical examinations with Tottenham, the Nerazzurri will inevitably have to intervene to flesh out the sides of Simone Inzaghi’s team in view of next season,” the website wrote. “According to Corriere dello Sport, one of the names evaluated remains that of Andrea Cambiaso of Genoa, but he is not the only profile. One of the names they like is that of Raoul Bellanova, with Cagliari who will redeem him from Bordeaux and then start him again. Inter would place him on the right with Dumfries, moving Darmian to the left. Another popular profile is Destiny Udogie: Udinese values him €15m and Juventus is also on him, reasons why the operation is neither easy nor immediate.”  Contact: theeditor@punchng.com Copyright PUNCH.
