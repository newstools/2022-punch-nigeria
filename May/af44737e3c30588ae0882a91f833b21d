The Anglican Diocese of Lagos Mainland will on Thursday, May 26, open its annual four-day synod with worship at the Cathedral Church of St Jude, Ebute Meta. The event is themed, ‘Let the children come to me: A focus on Baptism and the Sunday school (Matthew 19:14).’ In a statement made available to journalists on Sunday, it was stated that the Bishop of Pankshin Diocese in Plateau State, Rt Revd Olumuyiwa Ajayi, will preach the sermon during the event, while Dr Jude Onwueringo will serve as the cantor. The business session will be officially opened the next day at All Saints Church, Yaba, where various plenaries will examine how well the youth will be prepared by the church for greater spirituality and participation in the church and society. The Bishop of Lagos Mainland, Rev Akinpelu Johnson, will preside over the deliberations at the first session of the sixth synod for the 16-year-old diocese. Various churches in the diocese, guests, and friends from other dioceses and civil society will gather to analyse urgent issues facing the church and society during the synod, which is the Bishop’s annual festival. To drive the church’s focus for the next twelve months, recommendations are drawn at the end and shared with members and the larger society to achieve this.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
