A popular photographer in Sapele area of Delta State, simply identified as Mr Sunny White, has been reportedly shot dead. Sunday PUNCH gathered that the incident happened on Friday at his wife’s store on Otomewo Road by Oboscah Lane. An eyewitness said the killers of the photographer came in a numberless ash colour Toyota Corolla car and shot him while he was relaxing at the shop with his kids. “He was relaxing at the shop with kids while his wife was attending to customers. “White is a very respectable young man and he did not deserve to die this way. “With this act, it is obvious that security operatives need to step up their game in the area to stop the continuous assassination of young men,” the eyewitness said. According to him, the reason for White’s killing has not been ascertained. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Bright Edafe, stated that the killing was not reported to the command. He said, “The matter was not reported to the command, though there was a cult clash in the community.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
