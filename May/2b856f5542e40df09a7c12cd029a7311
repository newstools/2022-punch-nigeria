The Peoples Democratic Party, Ebonyi State chapter, said it has screened and cleared no fewer than 13 governorship aspirants ahead of its primary scheduled for May 23. The party’s Publicity Secretary, Mr Chika Nwoba, told the News Agency of Nigeria in Abakaliki that the aspirants included 12 males and one female. Their names were given as Dr Ifeanyi-Chukwuma Odii; Senator Obinna Ogba, Chief Austin Igwe-Edeze and Prof. Adaeze Nwuzor – the lone female aspirant. Others include Mr Fidelis Nwankwo, Dr Sylvester Ogbaga, Chukwuma Nwazunku, Dr Austin Nwazunku, Anayo Edwin, Chris Usulo, Dr Emmanuel Eze, Dr Sunday Opoke and Senator Paulinus Igwenwagu. The publicity secretary advised the aspirants to avoid any act or plan to cause disorder during and after the primary elections. “They should shun bickering and campaign of calumny against one another. They should be guided by the principle of sportsmanship as only one of them will emerge after the primary. “I urge them to present achievable manifestos and say no to any spirit that can lead to disturbing the process of the primary. “As a party, we will ensure a level playing field for all of them. We will also work hard to ensure that security is on the ground to achieve a hitch-free exercise,” Nwoba said.
