The Lagos State Government has commenced what it termed baseline data collation and status verification on water supply across the state with the aim of providing adequate quality water supply to residents. According to a statement on Monday, the state Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello, disclosed this at a training organised for field officers on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene survey in Ikeja, over the weekend. The commissioner was quoted as saying that the government needs adequate data to support policy formation on water resources. While acknowledging that water supply is inadequate in the state, Bello reportedly that it is only through baseline studies and data gathering that effective policies could be made. The commissioner, represented by the Director, Drainage Enforcement and Compliance, Mahmood Adegbite, added that 100 enumerators will be trained for the exercise to cover the 57 local governments and local council development areas in Lagos. He appealed to residents to support and accept the enumerators for a successful exercise, adding that the survey aims to ensure that safe and clean water is eventually available to all residents. He noted that the 10-day baseline survey of water supply and sanitation facilities in private and public facilities will cover hotels, schools, tertiary institutions, farm settlements, hospitals, gardens and more, except private houses.
