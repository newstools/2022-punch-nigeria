Fast-rising singer, Chukwuka Ekweani, popularly known as Ckay, has boasted about his forthcoming album. The Love Nwantiti crooner, whose album is set to be released later this year, noted that his album will make history. On his Twitter page on Wednesday, the singer wrote, “My album will make history.” This came hours after his fans expressed disappointment over the omission of his songs in the full list of the 2022 Headies nominations. In the nominations list released on Tuesday, CKay’s name only appeared as a featured artist in Ayra Starr’s “Beggie Beggie” which bagged double domination in the Best R&B Single and Best Collaboration categories. Amid disappointment from CKay’s fans that his hit songs, Emiliana and Love Nwantiti, didn’t make the nomination, the singer gave them something to look out for – his album. ‘Love Nwatiti’ garnered over two billion views on TikTok and 500 million more on YouTube. The song has also charted on six continents, hitting No. 1 in India, Norway, and Switzerland. Two weeks ago, CKay became the only Nigerian to make the 2022 Time‘s Next Generation Leaders list. The Time‘s Next Generation Leaders list recognises young people from across fields and around the globe “who are working to build a better world”. Time described Ckay as one of the most successful African recording artists ever on a global scale. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
