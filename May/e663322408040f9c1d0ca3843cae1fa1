A former Secretary to Ebonyi State Government, Professor Benard Odoh, on Sunday, emerged the All Progressives Grand Alliance governorship candidate to contest the 2023 general election in the state. Odoh polled 513 votes to emerge the candidate of the party during the primary election, which took place at the party’s state secretariat in Abakaliki. The Chairman of APGA Governorship Primary Election Committee in Ebonyi, Olalere Samson, who announced the results, said Odoh picked all the votes having contested unopposed. In his acceptance speech, the APGA governorship candidate, Prof. Odoh, described his victory as the beginning of the eventual liberation for Ebonyi people. He described APGA as the only viable party in the state, arguing that the ruling APC and the Peoples Democratic Party have been torn beyond redemption by crises. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
