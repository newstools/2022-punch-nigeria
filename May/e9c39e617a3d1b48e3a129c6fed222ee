The National Association of Nigerian Students, Osun chapter has urged the Federal Government to return to negotiation with the leadership of the Academic Staff Union of Universities to end the ongoing strike. This was contained in a statement co-signed by Oyelayo Oyewole and Salahudeen Adisa, NANS Chairman and Secretary, Osun chapter respectively, obtained in Osogbo on Thursday. The group also declared support for the national body of NANS’ plan to disrupt all presidential primaries, if the government failed to proffer a solution to industrial action. The statement read in parts, “NANS Osun Axis is using this solidarity period to implore the Federal Government to call for another negotiation between the two parties in a bid to put an end to the ongoing inglorious Strike. “We are using this period to charge the ‘’ASUU Leadership ’’ to employ and adopt flexibility during the cause of negotiation, as excessive rigidity may cause the process to reach yet another Dead-End. “We solidly stand on the position of NANS National Leadership of disrupting all presidential primaries, if the government failed to proffer a solution to the existing problem.” Copyright PUNCH.
