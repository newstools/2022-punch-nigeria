A 40-year-old man, Christian Ude, has appealed to well-meaning Nigerians for financial aid of N18m to undergo a kidney transplant. A statement made available to our correspondent noted that Ude’s ailment started some 15 years ago at his hometown in Imo State when he was initially diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. The statement further said that, as things got worse over the years, Ude’s family decided to make the bold move of transferring him to Lagos for proper medical diagnosis. His brother, Gideon Ude said in a statement, “In 2019, when my brother started discharging blood from his urinary organ, we rushed him to St. Leo Catholic Hospital in Ikeja. There, we were advised to take him to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba.” The statement also said Ude was then placed on twice-a-week dialysis at the cost of N80,000, but said the family soon became weary and cash-strapped, thereby necessitating the financial plea. “We have sold many properties, begged for help and everything we could do, but we are at a point where we need to call for help from people,” the statement said. A medical report signed by a consultant nephrologist at the LUTH, Dr Rotimi Braimoh, dated April 20, 2021, and made available to our correspondent, attested Ude had a chronic kidney disease and would be needing a kidney transplant.
