American reality TV star and entrepreneur, Kim Kardashian, rocked a dress, worn by late actress and singer, Marilyn Monroe, at the Met Gala 2022. Monroe wore the same dress in 1962 when she sang at the birthday party of the then President of the United States, John F. Kennedy. The stunning skin tight gown, worn by Kardashian to the annual fundraising event fondly referred to as fashion’s biggest night, was adorned with over 6,000 hand-sewn crystals. Sharing her excitement about wearing the historic piece, Kardashian took to her Instagram page early Tuesday to give an exposé on the dress. She titled her post, ‘Met Gala — In America: An Anthology of Fashion’, which was also the theme for this year’s event. Kardashian wrote, “I am so honored to be wearing the iconic dress that Marilyn Monroe wore in 1962 to sing ‘Happy Birthday’ to President John F. Kennedy. It is a stunning skin tight gown adorned with more than 6,000 hand-sewn crystals by costumier, Jean Louis. “Thank you Ripley’s Believe It or Not! for giving me the opportunity to debut this evocative piece of fashion history for the first time since the late Marilyn Monroe wore it. I am forever grateful for this moment.” The Met Gala ball which traditionally holds every first Monday in May, returned as scheduled this year. While the event could not be held in 2020, it was postponed to September in 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions. The event’s dress code, ‘Gilded Glamour and White Tie’, saw celebrities delving into the fashion archives of late-nineteenth-century New York, according to Vogue. Copyright PUNCH.
