The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, on Monday resigned ahead of the presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress. The President’s aide on Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Ita Enang, who is running for governor of Akwa Ibom State, also resigned. However, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, dropped out of the presidential race in order to retain his seat while the Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen, also gave up her senatorial ambition. Amaechi’s resignation was disclosed in a statement issued by the Amaechi Presidential Media Committee in Abuja on Monday. In a related development, Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, dropped out of the Kano Senate race on Monday. Although details were sketchy as of press time, it was learnt that the governor made the move in order to prevent some aggrieved chieftains in the APC from joining the New Nigeria Peoples Party led by former Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso of Kano State.
