Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the outgoing Archbishop of the Methodist Church of Nigeria, Archdiocese of Abuja, Joseph Job, has advised Nigerians to elect leaders who are willing to die for the country. This is as he condemned the N100 million high cost pegged for nomination forms by the All Progressives Congress, stating that charging as high as N100 million will fuel corruption among the political class. The Archbishop spoke at the Christ Methodist Cathedral in Nyanya, Abuja, during a send-off service held in his honour as he retires after 47 years of service. The cleric, accompanied by his wife, Elizabeth, urged citizens to live in peace and absolute security. On the right person to lead Nigeria in 2023, he said, “I am not particular on a religious basis. I am after a good and God-fearing leader, man or woman who loves this nation, somebody, ready to die for this nation, not just saying Nigeria first. Still, when he gets there, he puts himself first.” He urged citizens not to be foolish by “shooting guns and scaring people away from polling centres during elections to achieve a peaceful general election. We should now do real voting; transparent and fair elections.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
