Ibrahim noted that when she confronted her ex-lover and told him that what he did was rape, the latter insisted that they were in a relationship She said, “I told him what he did was rape but he said we were in a relationship. But was I ready? That was the question. Did I say I was in the mood? “I kept saying no, ‘stop it, stop it’. You pin me down and you’re doing whatever you wanted to do. You’re smiling saying, ‘don’t worry’, and you’re kissing whilst I’m crying, that means you’re a rapist and I had to leave that relationship.” “I fought my way out of that relationship because he even locked me up in his house for days until my sister Sonia came to find me.” She added, “Everyday, he wanted to do something and that’s rape.” The actress further advised women to report men who took advantage of them without their express permission, whether they were in a relationship or not. “But ladies you can report it now, go and report. If your husband is forcing you to do when you’re not in the mood, it is rape and I tell these men that they cannot force a woman,” she advised. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
