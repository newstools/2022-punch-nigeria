The Nigerian Army on Thursday said the troops of 93 Battalion have launched a search-and-rescue mission for its personnel missing in action during an attack on Tuesday. The PUNCH had reported that terrorists attacked the troops while responding to a distress call of an attack in Takum area of Taraba State, killing six soldiers. Confirming the incident on Thursday, the Army Director of Public Relations, Brig General Onyema Nwachukwu, said troops were combing the area and would leave no stone unturned to rescue its personnel. The statement read in part, “The troops had launched out swiftly on receiving a distress call that the Tati community was under attack and razed by suspected bandits. While in pursuit of the bandits, troops fell into an ambush staged by the criminals. “The troops fought fiercely through the ambush neutralising four of the bandits. Sadly, during the fire fight, six gallant soldiers paid the supreme price while one personnel was missing in action. “However, a reinforcement team from 6 Brigade deployed against the fleeing bandits at Ananum village in the Donga Local Government Area of the state, neutralised two additional bandits and recovered one AK-47 rifle, one pistol, one locally fabricated gun, two AK-47 magazines, 19 rounds of 7.62 mm special, seven rounds of 9 mm ammunition and three motorbikes.” Copyright PUNCH.
