The Bible Society of Nigeria on Wednesday unveiled its new vision and mission statements which would guide it in the quest to grow a community of Christians in Nigeria empowered by the Bible. The statements were unveiled by the General Secretary/Chief Executive Officer, Pastor Samuel Sanusi, at a press conference held in Lagos. Speaking during the unveiling, Sanusi said BSN had achieved its former vision, which was to achieve the widest possible effective distribution of the Holy Scripture, by being the most cost-effective scripture publisher in Africa. The BSN CEO then announced a new vision which is “to grow a community of Nigerian Christians empowered by the Holy Bible to make positive global impacts.” He said the new vision will be driven by BSN’s new mission statement which is “making the Holy Bible available and affordable to Nigerians in their preferred language and format, helping them engage with the word of God through life-transforming programmes.” The vision, he said, was coming at a time when Nigeria seems to be in dire straits, where all manner of crime and criminality have pervaded the nooks and crannies of the country. He said the vision would also be driven by life-transforming programmes which included marathons, Bible reading, national secondary school Bible quiz, Bible quiz for the deaf and also for the blind, and NYSC essay competition among others. “In pursuance of this new vision, we hope to engender national rebirth, reorientation, and slowly but surely grow a community of people empowered by the Holy Spirit to make global impact wherever they find themselves,” Sanusi said.
