One person was allegedly shot dead and some cops were injured when suspected hoodlums clashed with policemen on Friday in Calabar, Cross River State. The incident happened at the Cultural Centre, venue of the Akpabuyo/Bakassi/ Calabar South Federal Constituency primary election of the All Progressives Congress. Circumstances surrounding the incident could not be immediately ascertained by our correspondent. However, the state police spokesperson, Irene Ugbo, confirmed the incident. She said, “Some hoodlums attacked our anti-cultism/kidnapping squad and in the process, one of them was shot. Some of our officers were injured while some of the hoodlums were arrested and they are now in our custody.” A policeman was killed last Monday during the House of Representatives primary of the Peoples Democratic Party in Obudu, northern Cross River State.
