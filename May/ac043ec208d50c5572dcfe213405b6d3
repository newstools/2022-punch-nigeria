Veteran Nollywood actor, Chiwetalu Agu, has recounted his ordeal, after surviving a spiritual attack. The 66-year-old thespian said in a video making rounds on the Internet that his enemies waged war against his life by sending spiritual arrows of bullets, stones, pins and others, into his body. “Why I’m drawing attention to this very moment is to show you – just take a look at what is on this table,” he said, pointing at the said “weapons”. “Arrows of different types. We have arrows of cowries, arrows of sea stones, [and] arrow of pins. Look at this key, then look at bullets. They took all these from my chest region, my shoulder region and my neck region.” According to him, a mirror was also placed in his body by the spiritual attackers who tried to see what was keeping him alive despite the attacks. “The truth of the matter is that once you’re with God, nobody can harm you. However powerful their weapons are. At a point I was asleep, seeing myself five feet under the ground,” he disclosed. Agu also claimed that he was aware of where the attacks came from and that some of those trying to end his life were now suffering the repercussions of their evil. “They are not getting themselves health wise, some of them are like walking dead. I know all of them,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
