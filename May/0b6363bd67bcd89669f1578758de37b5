The Osun State government has said the reward of its investment in running rail service in the state would soon manifest through increase in Internally Generated Revenue. This was disclosed by the state Commissioner for Commerce, Industries, Cooperatives and Empowerment, Bode Olaonipekun, on Tuesday, shortly after the departure of the train conveying holidaymakers who had come to Osun from Lagos to celebrate the Eid-el-Fitr festival with their loved ones. According to him, inflow and outflow of finished and semi-finished products from Lagos through rail would create a lot of jobs and also generate IGR for the state government. The commissioner, who disclosed that the construction of the Dagbolu International Trade Centre had reached an appreciable stage, explained that the project would have a multiplier effect on the state’s economy as it would create jobs for the people and also generate more revenue for the government. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Ismail Omipidan, quoting Olaonipekun, further read in part, “As we all know, the history of having free train service dates back to about 11 years ago. “We are running the rail service to Osun because of the bigger picture of bringing and exporting raw materials and agricultural products, both finished and semi-finished products, out of Osun and also bringing finished products to the state. “The focal project for that is Dagbolu International Trade Centre, which is ongoing. I can tell you categorically that goods coming from Lagos to Osun have commenced and very soon you will see the rationale behind the government embarking on this free train service year-in-year-out. “On the long run, there are some investments that government made for you to pave way for some larger expanse of advantages, but in this case, you will see the effects and the benefits coming in very soon, and by the grace of God, before this year ends, both inflow and outflow of finished and semi-finished products from Lagos will go on in earnest as we look forward of creating a lot of jobs along that corridor and also generate some reasonable Internally Generated Revenue for the state government through the exercise.” Meanwhile, the beneficiaries of the Eid-el-Fitr free train service have applauded the state government for sustaining the good gesture over the years.
