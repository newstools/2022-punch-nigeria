The family of late Bamise Ayanwole has applied to the Lagos State Attorney General for fiat to prosecute the Bus Rapid Transit driver, Andrew Ominikoron, allegedly linked to their daughter’s death. The counsel for the family, Adesina Ogunlana, reportedly filed the application. The letter read in part, “We have been briefed by the family of late Bamise Ayanwola, the young lady murdered on February 26, 2022, aboard a Bus Rapid Transit vehicle to act as their solicitors. “We have their further instructions to apply to your office for fiat to prosecute the criminal charge preferred against one Andrew Nice Ominikoron presently before Hon. Justice Serifat Sonaike of the Lagos State High Court. “The family has formally expressed their wish to have a more independent body to conduct the prosecution in the circumstances of the matter. “In their view, a Lagos State Government’s agency and officials are involved in the matter and may not be reasonably expected to act as the prosecutor adequately against themselves. “Please find attached copies of their letter of instructions to our firm and organisation, the Radical Agenda Movement in the Nigerian Bar Association. “In addition, the family is concerned that the charges against the defendant also include allegations of rape of another person, an incident distinct and separate from that of the deceased’s family member. “This situation may result in an unnecessary complication. We look forward to a positive and timeous consideration of our request.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
