Champions Kano Pillars and Safety Babes started their title defence on a winning note at the first phase of the 2022 Prudent Energy Handball Premier League, which started on Monday at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja. Pillars took to the court against Police Machine in the second game in the male category and were dominant, neutralising the threat of their opponents to win 29-15. Newly promoted Benue Buffalos shocked Lagos side Seasiders 29-22, while Tojemarine, another Lagos side, lost to Confluence Stars 37-27. Pillars coach Solomon Yola described the game against the Police team as difficult, commending their opponents for putting up a good fight. “Our aim is to retain the title despite having good teams in the league. The players are fatigued, having just participated in the Winners Cup in Niger Republic. We also have players who are injured but that would not stop us from realising our ambition. It is good to start with a win and hopefully it will put us in good stead as the league progresses,” Yola added. In the female category, Safety Babes defeated Seasiders Babes 37-26, Rima Queens beat Bendel Dynamos 32-29 in a keenly contested game, while D-Defender Babes walked over Kada Queens, who are yet to arrive the venue due to security concerns. However, a source close to the team told the organisers that the team would be accompanied to Abuja by security personnel to avoid being kidnapped.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
