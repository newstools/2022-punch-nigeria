Some members of the All Progressives Congress in Osun State have accused the state leadership of the party of refusing to sell forms to certain people aspiring for different positions in the next general elections. The aspirants, who are seeking APC ticket for House of Assembly seats, also accused the party of using some elders to talk them out of contesting against the incumbent lawmakers. Two APC members aspiring for House of Assembly seats from Osun East Senatorial District, an aspirant for House of Assembly seat from Osun Central and two House of Assembly aspirants from Osun West, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told Sunday PUNCH that they had been approached to drop their ambition by committees put in place by the APC state leadership. An aspirant for the House of Assembly seat from the Osun East Senatorial District, said, “I was told to drop my ambition but I rejected the proposal. I have been asking them at the state secretariat of the APC for form but they are saying it is not available.” Another aspirant from Osun Central also said some elders of the party had met those aspiring for different positions, especially House of Assembly, and prevailed on them to drop their ambition. He said, “Some elders met us and told us to drop our ambition. They told us not to buy form. Anyone planning to buy form after the meeting with them will be regarded as a rebel. They won’t even sell form to anyone outside the group they want to return to office, going by the information available to us.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
