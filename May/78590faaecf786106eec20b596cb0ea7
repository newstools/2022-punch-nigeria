Some women-based religious groups have called for improved nutrition for infants and young children in the country. The leaders of the Federation of Muslim Women Association of Nigeria; Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria; the Women Wing of Christian Association of Nigeria; and the Redeemed Christian Church of God made the call during advocacy visits by the Accelerating Nutrition Results in Nigeria project, working with the Centre for Communication and Social Impact. The leadership of the religious groups promised their support and urged the ANRiN project to ensure that inputs from the faith communities were incorporated into the design and development of campaign materials. The National Ameerah of FOMWAN, Mrs Rafiah Sanni, expressed her happiness about the project, stating that it aligned with Islamic teachings for mothers. Sanni said, “I am very happy about this project, and I promise you that by the special grace of Allah, we will collaborate with you fully because all you have said here are part of the Islamic teachings for mothers.”  Copyright PUNCH.
