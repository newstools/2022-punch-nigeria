The Governor of the Central Bank, Mr Godwin Emefiele, has said that he would make a decision on the 2023 presidency in a few days. He said this in a series of tweets on Saturday. The CBN governor had come under heavy criticism over the All Progressives Congress’ Presidential Expression of Interest and Nomination forms reportedly obtained for him by farmers and friends. While some Nigerians asked him to resign, others asked the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) to sack him. He said, “I am humbled by the growing interest of those asking that I run for the Office of President in the 2023 general elections: I have not come to that decision. I note and salute the sacrifices of those farmers and patriots going as far as raising personal funds and offering me Presidential Nomination Forms: I thank them most profusely. “However, Should I answer their calls and decide to seek presidential nomination, I will use my own hard-earned savings from over 35 years of banking leadership to buy my own Nomination Forms,
without proxies in an open and transparent manner in full compliance with the laws and Constitution of The Federal Republic of Nigeria. “And should I not run for elected office, I will continue to serve and sacrifice for the good people of Nigeria under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari. This is a serious decision that requires God’s Divine intervention: in the next few days The Almighty will so direct.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
