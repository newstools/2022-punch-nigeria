Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State on Tuesday met with Nigeria’s former President Goodluck Jonathan behind closed doors. They met at the residence of the former president in Abuja, with a view to “strengthening the family ties of the PDP”. The PUNCH learnt that the duo discussed issues surrounding the fate of the party and the 2023 general election. Though both PDP bigwigs did not speak to the press, Chief Press Secretary to the Benue State Governor, Nathaniel Ikyur, told reporters, “The duo met behind closed doors for more than 40 minutes and discussed frankly. “They only came out, smilingly with the ex-president exchanging courtesies with everyone on the governor’s entourage. “They obviously discussed the Peoples Democratic Party and the future of Nigeria.” Jonathan’s meeting with Ortom came as a surprise owing to speculations about the latter’s presidential ambition under the All Progressives Party. However, Jonathan has not resigned his PDP membership as confirmed by many from the PDP and Jonathan’s aides. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
