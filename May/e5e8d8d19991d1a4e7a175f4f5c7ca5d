THE Lagos State Building Control Agency, on Saturday, pulled down the remains of a three-storey building that partially collapsed along Chris Ngadi Avenue, Ago Palace Way, Okota. The Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr. Idris Salako, said the government was carrying out thorough scrutiny into the causes of the building collapse. Preliminary investigations, however, suggested that a section of the building gave way due to over-density. The commissioner said that no casualties were recorded regardless of the fact that the building was in use. He added that the site had been cordoned off to guarantee safety. According to him, in order to avert danger, another building under construction on the same street was completely pulled down by LASBCA for poor construction and the use of inferior materials. Salako emphasised that all hands must be on deck to tackle the menace of building collapse as the frequency of its occurrence, particularly during the rainy season, was alarming and required aggressive measures to prevent future occurrences. He said the state government was putting several far-reaching measures in place to reform the regulatory environment. According to a release by the Deputy Director, Public Affairs of the ministry, Mukaila Sanusi, the measures included the application of stage-detection technology, automation of the activities of the Physical Planning Ministry and its agencies, and the creation of more district offices to have more presence in remote parts of the states and be able to detect illegal and distressed buildings.
