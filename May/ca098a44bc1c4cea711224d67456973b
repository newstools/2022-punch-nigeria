The Lagos State Commissioner for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Relations, Tayo Bamgbose-Martins, has said the government is moving from reacting to emergency situations to a state of preparing for disaster reduction and prevention. Bamgbose-Martins spoke during the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency’s stakeholders meeting held in Alausa, Ikeja on Wednesday. He noted that the stakeholders’ meeting was organised for key stakeholders to brainstorm on disaster management in the state. Bamgbose-Martins said, “This meeting is about the recognition that as a state, we need to always be in a state of preparedness and our preparedness must be adequate. We are preparing for disasters’ emergencies because they will come whether we like it or not and when they come, they don’t give any notice. “We are talking about building collapse, fire occurrences, flooding and so on. But that is what we are talking about here even though the world is talking about other things like pandemic, cyber security, climate changes, among others.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
