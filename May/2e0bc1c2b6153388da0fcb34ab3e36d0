The Central Bank of Nigeria has said paper currency will soon be out of circulation, urging market men and women to embrace e-Naira. The Delta State Branch Controller of CBN, Mr Godwin Okafor, stated this on Friday at the popular Ogbogonogo market during the market sensitisation on e-Naira, urged market men and women to key into CBN policy. He said, “We are here at the market today to sensitise the market people to the use of e-Naira. It is fully backed by CBN unlike the Bitcoin that has no legal backing.” Also speaking, CBN’s consultant on e-Naira, Dr Aminu Bizi, said Delta was chosen as the second state to sensitise market women on e-Naira after Lagos. “We are here to sensitize market men and women shop to shop on the use of e-Naira. CBN has gone behind ATM, POS, therefore, we are going to meet the Okada/tricycle union on this policy. “Paper currency will soon be out of circulation because CBN spent money to print money and people abuse the currency in the market, spraying at occasion, payment of okada/tricycle and others and CBN is losing.” In his remark, the Secretary to the State Government, Chief Patrick Ukah, applauded CBN for e-Naira initiative. Ukah, who was represented by the Director, Finance and Account in the office of SSG, Mr Benson Ojoko, said the state was delighted with CBN programmes, lauding CBN for the e-Naira initiative.
