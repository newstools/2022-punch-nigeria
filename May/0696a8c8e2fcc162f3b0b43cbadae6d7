Nollywood actor, Pere Egbi, has debunked the report which claimed that he and the current First Lady of Kogi State, Rashida Bello, were having an affair. In a tweet on Tuesday, the former Big Brother Naija housemate described the news as a “demonic lie”. He also threatened a lawsuit against the Nigerian US-based journalist, Jackson Ude, who wrote the report on Twitter. The reality TV star tweeted, “For the records, the publication about me and the First Lady of Kogi State is a demonic lie and a figment of a diseased imagination of Jackson Ude and those retweeting that rubbish. “They must answer me in court both in Nigeria and in the United States of America where he is based.” Ude, in a tweet, had allegedly stated that there was gist around Abuja that Pere and Rashida Bello, wife of Kogi State Governor and presidential aspirant, Yahaya Bello, were alleged lovers. “Why is #BBNaija Pere Egbi all over the place with Kogi First Lady, Rashida Bello? Gist around Abuja says that they are lovers. Egbi and Mrs Bello are said to have been sighted severally at the Hilton Hotel, Abuja. The gist is that when they first met, First Lady gifted Egbi N5 million,” Ude claimed. Though the tweet had been deleted, the screenshot of the said tweet has gone viral on social media.
