The Chairman, National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools, Abuja Municipal Area Council chapter, Jibrin Habiba, noted how government policies affect the growth of private schools in Nigeria. She added that her association was doing everything possible to ensure private schools remained alive. Speaking with selected journalists during the sideline of induction of new members of the association, Jibrin said, “Private schools in Nigeria  have helped in so many dimensions. Teachers have never gone on strike. Despite the limited resources, the schools ensure that teachers are well catered for. Children are also provided with a conducive environment where they can be comfortable with learning “Some government policies have affected private schools in Nigeria, in the area of multiple taxations, area of lack of grants, area of lack of social facilities such as good roads and water. These are some of the challenges. “We need government to soft pedal in the areas of multiple taxations, we need them in the area of grants, if we are given opportunities to access grants, we will do tremendously well because education is capital intensive. It is a long term investment. “Finances are the hurdles, we need education banks that schools can have access to. “It is our goal to improve our value propositions and delivery to the Education Sector. Jibrin also charged the inductees to remain relevant by belonging to and rendering service at the various wards and area council chapters of the Association. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
