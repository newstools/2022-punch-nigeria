Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Saturday in Abuja said Nigeria’s potential would be fully realised if it kept having honest leadership. He also noted that the country would soon see the outcome of the efforts expended by the current regime towards improving the security situation. Osinbajo spoke at the Presidential Villa when he received a delegation from the Christ Apostolic Church, led by its President, Samuel Oladele, at his Aguda residence. His Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday titled ‘How we are ramping up our security architecture, by VP Osinbajo.’ Osinbajo was quoted as saying, “Our country has potential if we can keep having honest leadership. When I decided I will run for office, I thought, let’s even put our minds to it. I have seen it for seven years and I know it can be done. “It’s a huge country and with the security challenges, we need to ramp up resources, men, and equipment. We need to ramp up the numbers, use of technology, get more military platforms and arms and ammunition.” Explaining the security situation further, he noted that it would take some time to reap the benefits of the government’s efforts toward securing the lives and properties of Nigerians. He recalled that the Federal Government ordered and fully paid over $469 million for the Tucano fighter jets about four years ago, but only got delivered last year. Osinbajo, however, affirmed that the FG was already “getting a handle on it. Now we are reconfiguring our security, local ammunition manufacturing is on the cards and a lot of work is going on. We pray we see some of the results soon.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
