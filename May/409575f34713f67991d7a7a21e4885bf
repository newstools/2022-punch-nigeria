A former Governor of Oyo State, Senator Rashidi Ladoja, has described the ruling All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party as  too arrogant because of their expensive nomination forms. He said this while speaking with journalists in Ibadan on Monday. He said making presidential aspirants to pay N100m for N56m salaries for four years and governorship aspirants to purchase N50m forms for N28m job will increase corruption. He urged Nigerians to vote candidates based on their competence, character and not because of their deep pockets. He charged other smaller political parties to compete favourably with the two leading political parties in the country. Ladoja said, “N100million nomination form for President and N50million for governors show the arrogance of the two leading political parties. “As a presidential aspirant, you are asked to come and purchase a form of N100million to seek a job of N56million while as a governor, your salary is about N7million in a year. This means you are going to earn N28million for the four years and you are asked to pay N50milliom to seek a job of N28million. “If other parties can also win elections in some states, the arrogance of the two major political parties will reduce. “These parties should understand that they are not the masters, people are the masters, they are just stampeding people thinking that the people would vote for them either they like or not.” Copyright PUNCH.
