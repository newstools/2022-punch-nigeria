Super Eagles coach, Jose Peseiro, has handed a late invitation to Valentine Ozornwafor for this month’s 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The Eagles are due to take on the Leone Stars at the MKO Abiola National Stadium, Abuja on June 9 before flying to Saint Pierre to take on Mauritius four days later. Ozornwafor invitation for the games  was revealed in a report on Sporting Charleroi’s website. The 22-year-old is expected to arrive in Abuja later this week. His inclusion in the team for the qualifiers further raises concerns over the availability of Ola Aina for the games due to an injury he sustained in training in Dallas Texas. The Torino wing back missed Nigeria’s 2-1 loss to Mexico in Dallas last Sunday remains a doubt for the Eagles next friendly against Ecuador on Friday at the Red Bull Arena in Harrison.
