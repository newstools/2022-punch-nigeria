Following his impressive performance in the 2021/22 season, Glasgow Rangers defender Calvin Bassey has been linked with an exit from the Scottish giants, with Bayern Munich and Chelsea in the race for the Nigerian, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. According to Fichajes, the two European giants are set for a fierce battle for the 22-year-old defender. Bassey raised eyebrows with his solid performances as he helped Rangers reach the final of the Europa League, where he was named the best defender in the final, despite the Scots’ defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt on penalties. The Nigerian has a year and a half left on his current contract, which expires in 2024, but that, according to the publication, will not stop clubs coming for the defender. “Despite having a contract with Rangers until 2024, Calvin Bassey could make the big leap in the next transfer market,” Fichajes wrote. “Bayern Munich, after confirming the departure of Niklas Süle, in addition to the arrival of Antonio Rüdiger at Real Madrid, the Bavarian team has been left without possible troops at the rear. For this reason, Calvin Bassey is presented as a possible candidate to reinforce the defensive plot. “Chelsea are in the best position to sign the Nigerian defender. After the departure of Antonio Rüdiger, added to the more than possible departures of César Azpilicueta and Andreas Christensen, those from Stamford Bridge must urgently reinforce the defensive plot. Calvin Bassey, adapted to British football, would be a great addition.” The Leicester City academy product made a total of 50 appearances for the Gers and had six assists in all competitions.
