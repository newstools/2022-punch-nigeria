A Catholic priest, Rev. Fr. Hyacinth Alia, has sought support as he joined the 2023 governorship race in Benue on the platform of the All Progressives Congress. The Catholic priest made the plea on Saturday night when he had an interactive session with the Benue community in Abuja. The session was organised by a group, the Alia Alliance, saddled with the responsibility of coordinating efforts to promote the priest’s governorship ambition. The News Agency of Nigeria recalls that in 1992, Benue had a civilian governor and Catholic priest, late Rev. Fr. Moses Adasu. Rolling out his seven-point agenda for development of Benue, Alia said his mission was to ensure that government continued to priorotise the needs of residents and people of the state. The renowned priest of the Catholic Diocese of Gboko said he would ensure that government served the people, if given the chance to lead the state. The aspirant listed his seven-point agenda to include enhancing education and healthcare, tackling corruption and other malpractices. “Social justice will be strictly adhered to the context of ‘One Benue, One Brotherhood’,” he said, adding that he would also stop land grabbers in the state. The aspirant pledged to create jobs and ensure massive industrial development through tax breaks and holiday to local businesses. “We will provide a leadership that will restore our values, pride and dignity,” Alia said. According to him, Benue has suffered from long years of ill-governance which has stunted its growth and development.
