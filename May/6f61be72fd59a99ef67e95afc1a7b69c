An Ekiti State Chief Magistrate’s Court, Ado Ekiti District, has ordered the remand of a 24-year-old man, Opeyemi Ayeni, in a custodial centre for allegedly killing a police officer. According to the charge, “the defendant was reasonably suspected to have murdered a police officer, Inspector Adeeko Olakunle, at the Okeyinmi area of Ado Ekiti, on May 15, 2022, contrary to Section 234 of the Criminal Laws of Ekiti State, 2021”. The police prosecutor, Samson Osobu, in an ex-parte application, sought the remand of the defendant in the custody of the Nigeria Correctional Service “to allow the police to complete their investigation while the duplicate case file will be forwarded to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for legal advice”. In his statement to the police, the defendant stated, “I am into Internet fraud (Yahoo-Yahoo). I was coming from the Adebayo area of Ado Ekiti on that day when my vehicle hit the deceased on Okeyinmi Street, Ado Ekiti, where he was trying to cross to other side of the road. He was rushed to a hospital, where he died.” Magistrate Dolamu Kay-Williams said, “I found the prosecutor’s application to remand the defendant genuine. The defendant is hereby ordered to be remanded in the Nigeria Correctional Centre, Ado Ekiti. The case was adjourned till July 13, 2022, for mention.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
