Despite a season blighted by injuries, Nigeria international Asisat Oshoala fended off competition from Real Madrid’s Geyse to claim the 2021/22 Women’s Spanish Primera Division Pichichi award for the league’s top scorer, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Oshoala scored 20 goals to finish as the league’s leading scorer ahead of Geyse (19) and teammates Lieke Martens and Alexia Putellas, who both finished the season with 17 goals apiece. The former Super Falcons captain played a major role as Barcelona were crowned Liga champions for the third time in a row and seventh in total – winning all 30 of their games in the season that ended on Sunday. The striker missed a large chunk (four months) of the season through injuries but her impressive start to the campaign helped her stay in contention for the prestigious award. After winning the Pichichi on Sunday, Oshoala became the third Barcelona player after Sonia Bermúdez and Jennifer Hermoso to claim the award since its inception in 2005. While Sonia has won the award four times, Hermoso has claimed the award a record five times. Oshoala also became the second non-Spanish player to win the Golden Boot award after Mexican Charlyn Corral, who claimed it in the 2017/18 season. Also, it was also a memorable season for another Nigerian forward Rasheedat Ajibade, whose 10 goals helped Atletico Madrid finish fourth on the log.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
