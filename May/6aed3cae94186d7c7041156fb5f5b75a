Akwa United will be hoping to return to winning ways when they welcome Enyimba to the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in a matchday 27 Nigeria Professional Football League fixture on Sunday (today). The Uyo-based side saw their six-game unbeaten run halted by Katsina United last Sunday and will be looking to avenge the 1-0 loss they suffered in Aba in the first half of the season with Tosin Omoyele grabbing the only goal of the game in the 27th minute. Enyimba will be heading into the matchup which has been classified as a Super Sunday encounter with more confidence having defeated Gombe United 3-0 last week in Aba. The Peoples Elephants will be banking on the good form of Victor Mbaoma who is the league’s second top scorer with 11 goals this season. Mbaoma would be returning to his old stomping ground having represented the Promise Keepers in 2019 on loan from Remo Stars. Speaking ahead of the game, Akwa coach, Joseph Ayeni, who says he was disappointed with the loss to Katsina United says the errors of the loss against will be corrected heading into the Enyimba clash. “Katsina United won the match because they were able to convert the chances they had. We have taken some positives from the game and we hope to build on it as we look forward to our next game at home.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
