The Lagos State Government has unveiled a partnership to boost its Comprehensive Schools Programme. Recall that the state government earlier in the year inaugurated its Comprehensive Schools Programme. A statement from the Lagos State Ministry of Education stated that the state government in partnership with the Government of Finland recently sent a group of selected teachers and coordinators in the programme on a two-week training course at Tampere University of Applied Sciences in Finland. The statement also noted that during the training held between April 18 and May 1, the group was immersed in the workings of an education system ranked the best in the world. The statement hinted that the aim was to pick up on teaching methodologies and strategies which could be incorporated into the state’s Comprehensive Schools Programme for the best possible results. The statement added that Finland is widely acclaimed for its student-centred approach to learning and in a stress-free environment. “Education in the Scandinavian nation is built on a guiding principle where teachers are encouraged to develop their inner skills; collaborate with other professionals to improve the national curriculum, and this makes for constant innovation,” the statement said. A teacher from Lagos Education District I, Adebayo Sodiq, alongside his colleagues, witnessed innovation first-hand when he sat in at a project presentation on recycling plastic to form rings, earrings, and other items at Ylojarvi Upper Secondary School. “I was impressed by the confidence of the students and the obvious depth of their know-how. It was also an eye-opener on how learning can move from the pages of textbooks into practical and useful purposes,” Sodiq said.
