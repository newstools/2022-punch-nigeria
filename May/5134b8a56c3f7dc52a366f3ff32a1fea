The management of the Kogi State Polytechnic, Lokoja, has expelled 196 students from the institution over poor academic performance. This was contained in a statement issued in Lokoja by the Head of the Public Relations Unit of the polytechnic, Uredo Omale. Omale said the Rector of the polytechnic, Dr. Salisu Usman, announced the expulsion of the students during an emergency meeting of the Academic Board of the institution on May 12. According to Usman, the expulsion of the 196 students was ratified on Friday, March 25, 2022. She quoted the Rector as “advising the remaining students to avoid distractions and remain committed to their academic pursuit as they prepare for the 2021/2022 first semester examinations scheduled to commence on Monday, May 16, 2022.” He said the polytechnic management was committed to making the teaching and learning environment conducive for both the staff and students. According to him, students’ good academic performance is a direct result of dedication and hard work achieved under a conducive learning atmosphere, which the institution has put in place. Usman, therefore, urged students to be diligent in their studies and graduate as planned. He expressed his displeasure over the high turnover of student withdrawals from the institution due mainly to poor academic performance. “The Rector reiterated that the administration would continue to put in place necessary measures and sustainable quality assurance in the institution,” the statement said.
