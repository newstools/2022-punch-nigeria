Speculations were on Wednesday put to rest, following Senator Ibrahim Shekarau’s formal defection to the New Nigeria People’s Party, a development that has finally put to rest the lingering tussle for power sharing in the Kano chapter of the All Progress Congress. The Special Adviser, Media and Public Relations to Senator Ibrahim Shekarau, Dr Sule Ya’u, who made the confirmation, via Skekarau’s News platform, said Senator Shekarau has already been registered and issued with NNPP membership card. Thereafter, according to Ya’u, the leader of the NNPP, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso presented Shekarau, with the Kano Central Senatorial form, to enable re-contest for the Senatorial seat on the platform of the NNPP. The ongoing developments in quick succession have formally put to rest the lingering tussle for power sharing in the Kano APC, a challenge that led to the disintegration of the Kano APC. Meanwhile, the control for the leadership of Kano state is currently narrowed down to a battle to be fought between the incumbent APC and the NNPP, which has become the political bride of politicians in Kano, as politician, desirous to record their names in Kano’s political history have been and still trooping to. Shekarau’s formal defection to the NNPP, has to a large extent, according to political observers further strengthened the party toward springing surprises in the 2023 general elections.
