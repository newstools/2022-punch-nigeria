The Lagos State Government on Wednesday ordered the immediate stoppage of approval for structures above three floors in Ebute-Metta East and West. The Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr. Idris Salako, said that the move followed an audit of buildings in the area. This was contained in a statement by the ministry’s Deputy Director, Public Affairs, Mukaila Sanusi, titled, ‘LASG orders stoppage of approvals for structures above 3 floors in Ebute-Metta’. The commissioner said the low-lying nature of Ebute-Metta and its negative impact on some of the buildings, most of which showed serious defects, made it mandatory for the government to apply special measures to save lives and property. “The soil and topography, the low water level and effects, as well as the inability of structures in this area to bear loads above three floors, were considered in arriving at this decision,” the statement quoted Salako as saying. He added that the Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority has been directed to henceforth stop taking applications for approval above three floors in the area. “To guarantee the safety of lives and property by ensuring that we put a halt to lives being cut short by incidents of building collapse, the Government has been compelled to invoke the relevant sections of the Lagos State Urban and Regional Planning and Development Law 2019, as amended, to address the crisis”, he said. Salako called for understanding of stakeholders, saying the decision is in the best interest of the state and residents in the area. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
