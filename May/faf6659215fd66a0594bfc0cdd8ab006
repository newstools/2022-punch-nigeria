Nigeria international Leon Balogun is determined to win the Europa League title with Glasgow Rangers against Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday. Rangers booked their place in the final after eliminating Leipzig in the semi-final of the competition. The Gers are set to face their third German oppositions having knocked out Borrusia Dortmund in the early round of the tournament. Speaking ahead of the final, Balogun, born in Berlin and started his career in the Bundesliga and is no stranger to the Germans, said he wanted to win the Europa at all cost. ‘‘We want to decide the game for us – come what may. I definitely think that this is a feasible task for us,” the 33-year-old defender was quoted as saying by a German media, Sportbuzzer. Balogun however regrets that the Estadio Ramos Sanchez Pizjuan, the venue for the final clash cannot accommodate more spectators. “Two strong and great clubs. It’s a shame that the capacities are so low,” he said, referring to the stadium in Seville, which only accommodates 40,000 people. “Both clubs could have sold 10 times their allocated ticket quota of 10,000 tickets.” The Super Eagles defender, who used to play for Hanover, Bremen, Düsseldorf and Mainz, has been with Rangers since 2020 and has enjoyed some success with the Scottish club. Balogun has made 10 appearances in the competition and has scored two goals en route to Rangers’ qualification to the final.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
