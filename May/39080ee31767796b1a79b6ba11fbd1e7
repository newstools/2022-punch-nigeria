No fewer than 69,828 pupils sat the 2022 National Common Entrance Examination for admission into the 110 Federal Government Colleges across the country. This was disclosed by the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, who added that Unity Schools remain the best in the country. The Minister of Education disclosed this on Saturday when he led some top ministry and National Examination Councils officials to monitor the examination in some centres in Abuja. Adamu, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Mr David Adejo, added that of the 69,000 who sat the examination, 36,855 were female while over 32,000 were male. He, however, expressed satisfaction with the conduct of the examination, adding that the laid-out standards would be adhered to in the selection of the successful candidates. “As far as the Nigerian basic education is concerned and with respect to the junior and secondary schools, the unity schools remain the best, so, for you to get into it, it has to be competitive. “We are not admitting all the over 69,000 applicants; we are taking the best from the number, and there are standards that measure what we take,” he said. On his part, the Registrar and Chief Executive Officer, NECO, Prof. Ibrahim Wushishi, said, “Lagos State registered the highest number of candidates with 19,516 candidates, while the least registered state is Kebbi with 74 candidates – they had 37 males and 37 females.”  Copyright PUNCH.
