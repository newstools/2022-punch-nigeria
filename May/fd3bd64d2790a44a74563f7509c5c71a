A Federal High Court sitting in Osogbo, Osun State has dismissed a suit seeking to declare Prince Dotun Babayemi as the Peoples Democratic Party candidate for the July 16 governorship election in Osun State. The court consequently affirmed Senator Ademola Adeleke as the validly elected PDP candidate for the poll. In his judgement which took over 1 hour, 30 minutes, Justice Nathaniel Ayo-Emmanuel held that the primary election conducted at the WOCDIF Centre, Osogbo, on March 8, 2022, which produced Babayemi was null and void.
