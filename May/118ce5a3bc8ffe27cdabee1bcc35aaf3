The newly inaugurated leadership of the All Progressives Congress in Enugu State has expelled the immediate past state chairman and governorship aspirant, Dr Ben Nwoye, from the party. The expulsion was announced on Tuesday night during a press conference at the South-East Zonal Office of the party shortly after an expanded meeting of the State Executive Committee and the Senatorial District Committee which was attended by all the 17 local government chairmen of the party. The state APC Secretary, Robert Ngwu, who read the resolution, accused Nwoye of engaging in anti-party activities, tending to disrupt the peaceful, lawful, and efficient organisation of the party. But reacting, Nwoye described the expulsion as a charade and political entertainment, while calling on the national leadership of the party to intervene in the lingering crisis in the Enugu APC. While denying all the allegations, Nwoye said he had remained faithful and loyal to the party since its formation and wondered how he could be working against the party he had sacrificed so much to build.
