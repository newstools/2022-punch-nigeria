Italian Serie A side, Torino, have set an asking price of €10m for Nigeria international Ola Aina, according to a report. The defender has struggled to settle into life in Italy and is looking to force a move out of the club with a return to England on the card. The 25-year-old lost his place in the starting XI since his return from the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon featuring in only five from a possible 16. The Chelsea youth academy has a year left on his current contract and has refused to put pen to paper to extend it beyond 2023. Now according to Italian online outlet Calciomercato, Aina, who started his career in England with Chelsea, is eager for a return with Fulham, Leeds, and Crystal Palace interested in his services. The publication added that the Maroons will allow the player for a fee believe to be around €10m. “Ola Aina is one of the players who will most likely leave Torino during this transfer market session,” the website wrote. “For the Nigerian full-back, manager Davide Vagnati is looking for buyers abroad, particularly in England where Aina himself grew up and played in Chelsea, Hull City and Fulham jerseys. “Torino’s goal is to be able to obtain around €10m from the definitive sale of the full-back.”  Contact: theeditor@punchng.com Copyright PUNCH.
