A Canada-based Professor of Education and presidential aspirant, Benedicta Egbo, has enjoined Nigerians to ensure they refrain from electing or re-electing present crops of politicians or leaders in the 2023 general election. This, she said, had become imperative to ensure that fresh hands and brains are given the opportunity to correct the ‘mess’ past leaders plunged the country into. Egbo stated this on Monday while declaring for the presidency on the platform of the National Rescue Movement. According to her, you cannot keep electing the people that created our problems and expect a different result. She said, “The challenges facing Nigeria are not intractable because the nation has so much talent, resources and potential. Indeed, Nigeria can become one of the most successful and respected nations in the world. “But, that requires visionary, transformational, patriotic, inclusive and at the same time, pragmatic leadership and a political party that has a forward-looking agenda.
