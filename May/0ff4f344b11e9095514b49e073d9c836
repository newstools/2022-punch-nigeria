The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Wednesday said his government would ensure wider access to quality education that would further reduce the number of out-of-school children. Buhari said this in his 2022 Children’s Day message contained in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina. According to Adesina, the President “celebrates with young Nigerians on the occasion of this year’s Children’s Day, pledging that his administration will continue to work hard to ensure that every child has access to education, which prepares them for a bright future. “The President recognises the place of education in the development of every country and is committed to seeing a further significant reduction in the number of out-of-school children. “He acknowledges that while education of the Nigerian child will remain on the front burner for this government, other issues – healthcare, protection from harm, drugs, cultism, child trafficking and abuse, domestic violence- are equally receiving needed attention from the government.” The statement noted that Buhari believes that Nigerian children deserve the best and a safe country  where they can grow, make friends, interact and travel freely, and emerge as successful leaders in different fields of endeavour. ‘‘With our investments in infrastructure, youth development, education, Information and Communication Technology, Digital Economy, Culture, Arts and Entertainment in the last seven years, I believe we are laying a solid foundation for a better quality of life for future generations in the country,’’ the President said.
