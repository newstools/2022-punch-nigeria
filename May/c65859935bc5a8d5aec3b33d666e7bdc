I wish to inform you all that I have decided that I will contest for the position of President, Nigeria Football Federation in the forthcoming election.” “I have been consulting with all football elders, and stakeholders and my consultations will still continue. Please remember me in your prayers.” The doctorate degree holder in Health Education and Human Kinetics had served as special assistant to three successive Nigeria Football Federation’s general secretaries and coordinated safety and security issues at a number of matches and competitions for CAF and the world football body FIFA.
