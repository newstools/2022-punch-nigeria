The Lagos State Government has warned the public against inciting ethnic and political sentiments by circulating a doctored video showing security men of the state at the Alaba-Rago Market in the Ojo Local Government Area of the state. The warning was contained in a statement by the state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotosho, in response to a video showing officers of the Rapid Response Squad and the Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Unit at the market. It was gathered that officials of the RRS and task force visited the market last Thursday to give a 14-day notice to the traders to vacate the area for the state government to remodel it. According to the commissioner, one of the reasons for the remodelling was the discovery of locally-made shotguns in the market a few weeks ago. “The video is accompanied by a voice, which is not that of any official of the two agencies. The voice is that of a faceless blogger trying to whip up ethnic and political sentiments over the planned relocation of traders for the remodelling of Alaba-Rago Market. It is illegal to bring ethnic, religious, or political colorations to such an exercise, which is designed to ensure development and better security in our communities,” he added.  Copyright PUNCH.
