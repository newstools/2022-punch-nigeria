Yoghurt brand, SuperYogo, says it has embarked on a campaign to reward Muslim faithful for a peaceful and successful month-long Ramadan fasting period in fulfilment of the fourth pillar of Islam. According to a statement by the company, to herald the season, SuperYogo launched a Ramadan Campaign tagged ‘Goodness for the Season.’ The statement added that the campaign offered an opportunity to further highlight the nourishing and revitalising benefits of the brand as well as share goodness inherent in every pack of SuperYogo for replenishment in the spirit of the season. The campaign involved providing packages of SuperYogo filled with nourishing goodness across several mosques and praying grounds across the country. It culminated in Eid El Fitri day at the Eid Praying Ground, Alausa, Ikeja. According to the statement, over 2,000 Muslim consumers were offered take-home meals at the Eid praying ground in Alausa on Tuesday as the brand felicitated with Muslims this season. SuperYogo is a  refreshing, nourishing, brain and body snack which can be consumed anywhere to refuel the body. Alhaja Moji Oseni, an Islamic faithful at the Central Mosque, said, “I am glad at the gesture of support and identification with Muslim faithful from this beloved brand as we nourished our souls as well as our bodies. The Ramadan period is a time for generosity, communal bonding, sharing love as well as nourishment.” Brand Manager, SuperYogo, Abimbola Odimayo-Olabode, said the Ramadan campaign tagged ‘Goodness for the Season’ was organised to help Muslims who joined the fasting enjoy physical replenishment with their loved ones. “We join our Muslim brothers and sisters to celebrate this Eid el-Fitri. The fasting and prayers over the past month have been an opportunity to receive spiritual blessings. In the same way, we want them to enjoy physical replenishment by taking the nutritious goodness of SuperYogo and sharing it with their loved ones and members of their community.”
