Ahead of the International Children’s Day celebration 2022, the Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen, has said that the Federal Government has established family courts in 16 states to ensure child-friendly justice for children, either as victims or as offenders of violence. Tallen at a press briefing on Tuesday noted that the establishment of family courts resulted from the effective advocacy and sensitisation for effective implementation of the Child Rights Law across the country. According to her, the theme for the year is ‘Strengthening Supportive Systems for the Protection of the Nigerian Child; A Wake-Up Call.’ She noted that despite efforts by the government and other stakeholders, children were still vulnerable and victims of abduction, ritual killings, rape, child marriage, domestic abuse, and others. She added, “As a ministry, we are sometimes overwhelmed with these issues and it will seem as if we are not doing enough. “More worrisome is the recent increase of violence in schools, where children are physically and sexually abused online and offline. “In the meantime, the ministry, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, has developed policies and carried out a series of programmes to ensure the safety of children. “The establishment of family courts in 16 states of the federation is a direct result of the effective and sustained advocacy.” Tallen also noted that to ensure the safety and protection of children, she also reconstituted the technical working group on ending violence against children and the management in Nigeria.
