There had been insinuations that Ojo had defected to APC to reunite with his kinsman from Ile-Ife, Senator Iyiola Omisore, the National Secretary of the party.

This was after a former Osun PDP chairman, Mr. Soji Adagunodo, was chosen as the new South-West Vice Chairman of the party. Before Ojo was appointed as Osun PDP chairman in an acting capacity by his group. He was the Osun East Senatorial leader of the party. Responding to enquires by our correspondent regarding his rumoured defection to APC through a text message, Ojo simply said, ‘The process is ongoing.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
