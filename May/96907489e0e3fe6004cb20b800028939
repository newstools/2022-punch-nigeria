Progress has emerged the winner of the Nigerian Idol Season 7. This was announced at the Grand Finale which was broadcasted across Africa Magic stations on Sunday, monitored by The PUNCH. The show’s host, IK Osakioduwa, announced Progress as the winner after he battled with Zadok, for the grand prize worth N100m. After weeks of watching the top 12 contestants singing their hearts out on the live shows to earn fan votes, Progress and Zadok emerged as the final two. For the finale, D’banj and Simi, who are also judges for the show, performed on stage and thrilled the audience. D’banj had a performance with the two finalists, while the season 6 winner, Kingdom Kroseide, performed with the other 10 finalists. As the winner of the competition, Progress goes home with a cash prize of N30m, a brand new SUV, a Bigi-branded refrigerator and a year’s supply of Bigi drinks. He will also get to record an Extended Play album produced by a leading music producer in Nigeria and a music video, a weekend getaway from TravelBeta, and a DStv Explora fully installed with a 12 months premium subscription.
