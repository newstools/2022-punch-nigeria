Nigerian skit maker, Maryam Apaokaji, popularly known as Taaooma, has revealed that her mother inspired some of her skits. The comedian, known for acting out multiple characters in her skits, made this known in an interview with show host and actress, Nancy Isime. In the interview published on Wednesday, Taaooma noted that she got ideas for her skits whenever she was around her mum. When asked what or who inspires her skits, Taaooma answered, “My mum. Whenever I’m around her, she gives me -unknowingly- a lot of stories; a lot of things, yeah.” She also added that she does get ideas from daily activities that happen around her too. Taaooma further revealed that it would be difficult for her to act out a skit on stage because she had to play out up to seven or eight characters. “It’s going to be difficult for me to act out a skit on stage because I’m like seven or eight characters. If I was this person where it’s differentiated, it’s going to be nice… I might but, right now, it’s not on my mind,” the comedienne said. Taaooma, during the interview, also revealed that she didn’t know what she would have done if she hadn’t delved into comedy. Speaking of her childhood ambitions, she said, “I wanted to be a doctor. Later, I changed it to a lawyer. I got to university and was offered Tourism, which I actually love. I do love it. It’s a good course. It’s good if you love adventure.” Copyright PUNCH.
