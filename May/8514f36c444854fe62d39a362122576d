Akinkunmi Amoo is out of the Super Eagles international friendlies against Mexico and Ecuador and the 2023 AFCON qualifiers, after FC Copenhagen manager Jess Thorup confirmed that the midfielder has been ruled out for the rest of the season. The Eagles are scheduled to play Mexico and Ecuador on May 28 and June 2 respectively at the AT&T Stadium, Arlington, Texas. Amoo earned his first senior call-up for the Qatar 2022 World Cup play-off against Ghana in March but was an unused substitute. Since joining the Danish club in January, things have not gone quite as planned for the 19-year-old winger, who has only made Copenhagen’s match-day squad on three occasions, where he featured in two of those and was left on the bench in the game against Midtjylland. The former Brightville Academy player’s hope of making his first Eagles appearance has been dashed after he picked up an injury with Thorup adding that the winger’s season may be over. “Amoo has got a sprain in the back thigh and is, as it looks now, out for the rest of the season,” Thorup was quoted as saying by bold.dk. According to www.nhs.uk, such injury could take weeks or months to recover from, which means the former Golden Eaglets star could miss the Eagles two 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers in June.
