One of the highlights of the fashion’s biggest night in Hollywood, the Met Gala, was how celebrity couples showed up at the annual fundraising event. The event, which traditionally holds every first Monday of May, had its 2022 theme as, ‘In America: An Anthology of Fashion’. The event’s dress code, ‘Gilded Glamour and White Tie’, saw celebrity couples delving into the fashion archives of the late 19th Century. In this piece, The PUNCH highlights how some celebrity couples turned up at the event this year. See photos below: Photos: People Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
