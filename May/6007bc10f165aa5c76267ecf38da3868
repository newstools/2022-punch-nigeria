The family of a former Imo State Governor and All Progressives Congress presidential aspirant, Rochas Okorocha, has accused the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of failing to interrogate him 24 hours after his arrest. The PUNCH had earlier reported that EFCC operatives on Tuesday broke into Okorocha’s Abuja house after a seven-hour siege and arrested him. The commission had explained that it arrested the former governor for jumping administrative bail earlier granted him. In an interview with The PUNCH on Wednesday night, a daughter of the former governor Uloma Okorocha, said the EFCC had not shown it was in a hurry to interrogate her father. The development, she said, had further confirmed that her father’s arrest and detention might be part of plots to stop him from participating in the APC presidential screening and primaries. She said, “Since his arrest, no official of the EFCC has spoken to him. He has not been interrogated, despite the desperation to arrest him. Everyone saw how they invaded his home, shooting as if they were arresting a terrorist. After several hours of showdown, they damaged the doors and some other property in the house before they whisked him away. “There was also heavy shooting as policemen attached to the commission tried to chase away family members and supporters of the serving senator. With all these, he has not been questioned 24 hours after.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
