The Lagos State Police Command has said necessary human, material and operational resources had been deployed to forestall any breakdown of law and order during enforcement of the ban on motorcycle operations at six local government areas in the state. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin, in a statement on Sunday, said the attention of the police command had been drawn to a panic-laced message making the rounds on social media purporting that motorcycle riders had concluded plans to disrupt social and commercial activities in the state from June 1, 2022, in protest of the ban on the use of motorcycles within six LGAs in Lagos State. He said, “The state Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi, uses this medium to assure all Lagosians that all necessary human, material and operational resources have been deployed across the state to forestall any breakdown of law and order. “A carefully drafted security architecture, resulting from a detailed crime-mapping of the state has been emplaced across the length and breadth of the state. In addition, all Area Commanders, Divisional Police Officers and tactical commanders have been placed on red alert towards any eventuality. “The CP, therefore, enjoins all residents of Lagos State to go about their lawful businesses without fear of harassment or intimidation before, during and after the touted date for the purported civil disturbance, as officers and men of the command are fully on top of the situation.” Copyright PUNCH.
