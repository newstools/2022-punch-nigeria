Former Chief of Army Staff and Nigeria’s Ambassador to the Republic of Benin, General Tukur Buratai; Nigeria High Commissioner to the Republic of Zambia, Nwanebike Oghi; and some non-career ambassadors on Wednesday presented an 18-seater bus to the leadership of the All Progressive Congress. The white bus, which was manufactured by Innoson Motors, was branded at the bottom with “Donated by Conference of Non-Career Ambassadors.” The presentation took place at the APC National Secretariat after the delegation held a closed-door meeting with the party chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu. Explaining the purpose of the donation, Oghi, who is also the leader of the non-career ambassadors, disclosed that it is for the party electioneering campaign. “We know that at this particular time the party is going through electioneering processes and they need logistics. It is in that spirit that we bought our own 18-seater bus Innoson motor to support the party. “We are for homecoming, as non career we are party men, we come to congratulate our new NWC led by Senator Abdullahi Adamu,” he said. When pressed for other subtle interests other than electioneering logistics, the ambassador said, “Our interest is obvious, to continue producing the president that will lead the country forward.” Copyright PUNCH.
