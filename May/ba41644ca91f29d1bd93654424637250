The government of the United States of America is committed to strengthening the burgeoning US-Nigeria cultural ties through music, arts, film, cultural heritage, and professional and educational exchanges. The US Mission Nigeria hosted a reception on Thursday, May 12, 2022, to honour the 15th Annual Headies Music Awards, which will be held for the first time in Atlanta, USA, later in the year. Delivering remarks at the event, Ambassador Mary Leonard applauded the growing ties between the two countries in the creative industry. She explained that the choice of Atlanta to host the Headies symbolised the growing relationship between the music industries in the US and Nigeria. She said, “This year’s Headies awards will highlight the growing US-Nigeria ties and the vast potential of Nigerian musicians as cultural exporters.” In his welcoming remarks, the acting US Consul General, Brandon Hudspeth, added that cultural and artistic exchanges are just one way by which the US partners with the people and government of Nigeria. He said, “We continue to explore innovative ways to foster valuable people-to-people connections between our two countries.” On his part, the Executive Producer of the awards ceremony, Ayo Animashaun, said, “The Headies recognises outstanding achievements in the Nigerian music industry. Our goal is to continue to support the development of talent and nurture innovation in the industry.”  All rights reserved.
