THE Chief Executive Officer, Cedrus Group Africa, Olubusayo Adeniyi, has said the group is bridging infrastructure gap to boost investment into Africa and the country. He spoke during a press briefing in Lagos ahead of its upcoming programme tagged ‘Cedrus 5,000 Plus Africa SMEs’, aimed to position SMEs to become better players locally and internally. Adeniyi said, “Cedrus Group Africa is an investment banking firm. We are globally minded, and Africa focused. We actually exist for the purpose of bridging the gap in infrastructure in Africa and every other jurisdiction we are represented. “We discovered that Africa has not actually been an investment origination and destination.  We are here to use innovative means to provide investment solutions to the various needs. “We have dynamic experienced people within the field of investment providing investment solution. We have actually started to provide the solution to both government institutions and corporation, individuals and as many that will come across our needs.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
