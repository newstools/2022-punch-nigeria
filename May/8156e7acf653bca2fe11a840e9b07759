The media office of the Enugu State Peoples Democratic Party’s governorship candidate, Dr Peter Mbah, on Sunday said there was no truth in a claim that the candidate has been assassinated. The news of Mbah’s alleged assassination went viral earlier on Sunday. But his media office, in a statement signed by Dan Nwome, described the report as fake, wicked and evil. The statement was titled, “Fake news on the assassination of Dr.Peter Ndubuisi Mbah.” It read in part, “We have been inundated with calls over fake news in circulation on some social media platforms on the purported assassination of the Enugu State PDP governorship candidate, Peter Mbah. “The story is false, wicked and evil. “Our investigations indicate that the story was doctored from the video of the unfortunate gruesome assassination of one Dr Ndubuisi (real name: Prof Samuel Ndubuisi), the Director General of the Science and Equipment Development Institute along the Enugu Port Harcourt expressway, two years ago. “It is the mere coincidence of ‘Ndubuisi’ in the two names that have been twisted by some devious and malevolent characters to spread unfounded panic and alarm amongst our genuinely concerned teeming supporters and well-wishers in Enugu State and beyond.” “We condemn this wicked, ill-conceived misinformation and urge the masterminds to play politics of moderation and sportsmanship, have the fear of God and develop respect for the sanctity of human life.”  Copyright PUNCH.
