Street sensation, Naira Marley, on Monday released his debut album, God’s Timing The Best. The singer had teased his fans with the release of the anticipated album in a tweet on Sunday, “My first Album GTTB out midnight May 30. ‘God’s timing’s the Best’ for real. Marlians, are you ready?” Following the release of the album, mixed reactions have trailed the album as fans praised the singer while critics slammed him. Faulting the singer’s album release date, @unclebayotics tweeted, “Naira Marley dropped the first album of his career. No PR, no hype, nothing. He still dropped it on a Monday morning. Does he think he’s Wizkid or something?” But @mbahdeyforyou justified the release date, saying, “Naira Marley drop the album on Monday morning because marlians no dey go work.” “This Naira Marley album anything worst than rubbish should qualify it,” @oba_leks asserted. “Naira Marley should just quit music and focus on smoking,” @chocolekan advised. Some fans, however, hailed the singer for God’s Timing The Best. A fan, @snehqueenbee, tweeted, “It seems Naira Marley recorded most of these songs in 2019. It’s not a bad album.” “Naira Marley’s album isn’t as bad as you people are making it seem,” @frahan_oa said. The Marlian Records boss had hosted a listening party on Sunday night ahead of his album release. Under 12 hours of release, GTTB had hit the no 1 spot on Apple Music’s top Nigerian albums chart. The 14-track album is the singer’s first since his 2017 single Issa Goal pushed him to the limelight. Naira Marley has two Extended Plays, Lord of Lamba and Gotta Dance. Copyright PUNCH.
