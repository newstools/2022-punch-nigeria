A terminal operator, AP Moller Terminal, has partnered Maersk Shipping Company to boost port efficiency in Nigeria. The company in a statement said that a remarkable improvement in operational efficiency had been achieved on the West Africa network, with Fixed Berthing Windows, FBWs, among the key and high-impactful levers. Explaining further, it said that FBWs were first launched mid-2021 at APM Terminals Apapa, after which they were introduced at West Africa Container Terminal in Onne, Meridian Port Services in Tema and APM Terminals Nouakchott. The statement partly read, “Fixed Berthing Windows have been made possible due to a strong collaboration between teams, creative network solutions and focused execution. FBWs have enabled a reduction in deployed capacity by 15 per cent, while slightly increasing carrying capacity, thus allowing twenty-foot equivalent units-saved capacity, improved productivity and reduction in vessel waiting time. In these extraordinary times, capacity is priceless and asset turn improvement is critical for the success of the company strategy.” The statement also quoted Joe Sunxiuwu of Huawei as saying, “Fixed berth window is a big innovation and improvement. From that, the international leading time from China reduced more than one month. The time-saving can drive project delivery completion as earlier as possible and bring lot of profits for Huawei customers, like MTN, Airtel, amongst others.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
