A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in Cross River State, Pastor Usani Usani, has defected to the People’s Redemption Party. The former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs confirmed the defection on Thursday in a phone conversation with journalists. The party had a consensus arrangement for the governorship ticket which 17 aspirants were jostling for. According to him, “We built up the All Progressives Congress and the members of the APC are not my enemies. The constriction of the democratic space has occasioned this expediency.” He said the defection was to enable him to actualise his governorship ambition. Usani was one of the pioneer members of the party in the state and was appointed by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), as Niger Delta Affairs Minister between November 2015 and May 2019. Usani had contested for the governorship seat in the state three times; in 2003, 2011, and 2019. It will be his fourth attempt if he eventually contests in 2023. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
