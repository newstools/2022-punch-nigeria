The Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Nnaemeka Achebe, has debunked media reports attributed to him that he called on the Igbo living in the North to flee the area over the murder of Deborah Yakubu. There have been ongoing reports in some media platforms which indicated that the monarch had asked Ndigbo to leave the Northern part of the country following the killing of Deborah, a student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto State over alleged blasphemy. The monarch, in a statement by the Chief of Staff, Ime Obi Onicha, Chinyeleugo Anionwu, debunked the reports, describing them as fake. In the statement titled, ‘Obi of Onitsha has not issued any statement regarding recent events in the Northern part of the country’, the monarch asked the public to disregard such reports. The statement read in part, “The attention of Imeobi Onicha Palace has been drawn to a statement to the effect that His Majesty, Nnaemeka Achebe, Agbogidi, Obi of Onitsha has called on every Igbo living in the North to come back home immediately. “The statement which has gone viral on social media is fake and should be discountenanced.” Copyright PUNCH.
