The National Leader of All Progressive Congress, Bola Tinubu, has endorsed Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, for a second term in office. The Commissioner for Information, Gbenga Omotoso, made this known on Friday. This followed speculations that Sanwo-Olu may be denied a second term in office. “LET’S GO: Asiwaju endorsing Governor Sanwo-Olu for another term at an APC stakeholder meeting today. Thank you all for all your loving thoughts,” he posted. In another post on Facebook, Sanwo-Olu expressed delight at the endorsements he had got. He said, “I accepted the honour of being endorsed for 2nd term by an amalgamation of Igbo Traders in 58 markets in Lagos under the umbrella of Ndigboamaka Progressive Markets Association. “For decades, Igbo traders have remained prominent players in the economic growth of our state. “This endorsement is yet again another opportunity to recognise our Ndigbo brothers and sisters for their commitment to the growth and development of Lagos. “Certainly, Ndigbo traders have been part of the good story of Lagos; your entrepreneurial spirit is second to none and the Igbo enterprising spirit has become a case study in Harvard. “I’m happy that our modest interventions for more growth are visible and being recognised. “I accept this endorsement with much gratitude to all members of the association and entire Ndigbo in Lagos.” Copyright PUNCH.
