Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar on Sunday met two factions of the Peoples Democratic Party in Osun State, soliciting the support of the delegates ahead of the party’s presidential primary. He had also visited Oyo State. In Osun State, Atiku and his entourage had earlier met members of the PDP belonging to the faction loyal to the party’s governorship candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke, at the party’s state secretariat in Osogbo. The delegation later proceeded to the GRA Osogbo residence of ex-Osun State Governor, Olagunsoye Oyinlola, where it held talks with the faction backing the candidature of Dotun Babayemi. Speaking at the PDP secretariat, Atiku urged different interests in the party to close ranks and work for its victory in the next governorship poll. He said, “I don’t believe I need to come to Osun to ask for your support because if you vote for me, you vote for yourself but there is something that worries me about this state. “Last election, a disagreement within the PDP made us lose the election. We are going through the same crises and disagreements within the PDP. “Believe me, if there is anything that brought me here, it is to appeal for your unity. I want you to unite and make sure you win the forthcoming gubernatorial election. “No matter your grievances, you could see what disunity caused during the last election. My becoming president depends on Osun because it is a safe zone for me.” Receiving Atiku and his team to his residence, where he met some leaders of Babayemi’s faction, Oyinlola said having married an indigene of Osun, the ex-VP would enjoy the support he requested from the delegates.
