Political Adviser to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senator Femi Ojudu, has assured Niger State delegates in the forthcoming All Progressive Congress presidential primary that their welfare and comfort during the exercise have been settled. Ojudu, who spoke to the delegates on Wednesday in Minna while they waited for the Vice President who was in a meeting with the leadership of the Party, told the delegates that the Vice President takes them as partners in progress and not followers. Ojodu revealed that all arrangements have been made for all delegates during the presidential primaries to make them comfortable and at ease. He said “We have made hotel accommodations available for you even before you leave here. When you get to Abuja, you will be given your room and everyone will have a room to himself or herself. “Your feeding and transportation during the period will also be catered for. A desk will be created in every hotel to take care of any challenge you may have. The political adviser told journalists that they wouldn’t be allowed into the meeting with the delegates because it was a ‘family meeting’. Osinbajo had a closed door meeting with the delegates that lasted for over two hours and left afterwards without speaking with journalists. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
