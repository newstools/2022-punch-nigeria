INDIGENES of Ila-Orangun community in Osun State, have asked Osun State Government to convert the State College of Education in the town to a University of Technology and Innovation studies. The demand was contained in a letter addressed to the Speaker, Osun State House of Assembly, and co-signed by Mr Rasaq Adedapo, Mr Paul Ogunrinade and Mr Oyeniyi Oke on behalf of Ila-Orangun Community Development Council. The community said it wanted the College of Education to be upgraded to a university because of the worrisome students’ enrolment status into the NCE programmes. The letter read in parts, “This proposal arises after a critical analysis of the present situation of the college, which gives us an impression that the future prospects and sustainability of NCE programmes is certainly bleak. Student’s enrollments into the various programmes has continued to drastically decline in the last five years or so. “Recent statistics of students that sat for the 2019 UTME shows that 1,803.742 candidates sought admission into the degree programmes of various universities while only 34,141 (1.8%) sought admission into the Colleges of Education. “The Osun State College of Education, Ila-Orangun is not an exemption from this ugly trend of declining enrollment into the NCE programmes of the college and a steady rise in enrollment into the degree programmes which the college runs in affiliation with the Ekiti State University, Ado-Ekiti.” The community said if the college was suitably reconfigured into a specialised university, it would attract huge number of students.
