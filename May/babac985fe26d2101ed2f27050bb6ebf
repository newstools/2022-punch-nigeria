The Lagos State Government has called on heads of schools to implement the child protection policy enacted by the state. The Executive Secretary of the Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency, Mrs Titilola Vivour-Adeniyi, made this call on Thursday at a meeting with principals and teachers in Alausa, Ikeja. Vivour-Adeniyi explained that the child protection policy which was formulated in 2016 would curb abuse in schools. She said, “We are here to discuss critical issues that concern the best interest of children and child protection and we are also engaging other stakeholders like social workers, doctors, and religious institutions on the necessity of safeguarding children. “Asides from having a child rights law, there is a policy that guides child protection and safety and it was formulated in 2016 and we need to enlighten you of these provisions and enforce it in your schools.” The Director-General, Office of Education and Quality Assurance, Mrs Abiola Seriki-Ayeni, noted that the state would continue to monitor, evaluate and enforce child protection in all school districts. “The Lagos State government organised this sensitisation programme for public and private schools in District II and has also mandated all schools, communities, agencies and organisations to give priority to the protection of children,” she said.
