A former Governor of Zamfara State, Alhaji Abdulaziz Yari, has ordered the immediate withdrawal of four cases filed against the leadership of the All Progressives Congress. The decision followed the reconciliation of the feuding camps in the Zamfara State chapter of the APC. The National Chairman of the APC, Abdullahi Adamu, had reconciled the camps of the state Governor, Bello Matawalle; his predecessor, Yari; and Senator Kabiru Marafa. The reconciliation opened a new chapter of the APC in the state. Before the reconciliation, the feud between the various camps had factionalised the Zamfara state chapter of the APC. Efforts by the defunct caretaker committee of the party under the leadership of the Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, to resolve the issue were fruitless. Sources said the announcement of the withdrawal of the suits was made by Marafa at the end of a consultative meeting of stakeholders held at Garba Nadama Hall in Gusau on Wednesday. Three of the suits were instituted to challenge the party congresses in the state and the members of the State Working Committee that emerged from the exercise. The fourth suit was instituted against the national leadership of the APC. Marafa was said to have told the gathering that the withdrawal of the suits was to further consolidate the reconciliation efforts and give Governor Matawalle the necessary support to concentrate and tackle security challenges. He said Zamfara State APC is now united under one leadership and that all members are now working in harmony in the interest of the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
