The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Tuesday had a closed-door meeting with state governors and some members of the National Assembly elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress inside the Presidential Villa, Abuja. At the end of the meeting, the parties kept sealed lips on what they discussed. A source at the APC secretariat, however, told our correspondent that the meeting bothered around the coming primaries and the need for consensus. This is even as he disclosed that the outcome of the meeting with the President would determine the direction of the primaries and the new date for the postponed presidential screening. A meeting of the APC governors had earlier taken place on Monday night at the Kebbi Governor’s Lodge in Asokoro. The source also stated that Buhari might meet with presidential aspirants later.
