A human rights activist and a member of the Anambra State #EndSARS panel, Mr Vincent Ezekwueme, has called on the South-East governors to start implementing the reports of the panel as a way of dousing the current insecurity and tension in the region. While addressing journalists in Awka, on Monday, Ezekwueme wondered why none of the state governments has started implementing the recommendations of the #EndSARS report, several months after it has concluded sitting. He pointed out that victims who suffered various forms of damage as a result of police brutality are looking at the #EndSARS report as a consolation, He said, “If the report is implemented by the government, it will certainly assuage the pains, sufferings and loss incurred by the victims, petitioners as well as wipe away tears and sorrows of those who lost their loved ones, those who sustained injuries, permanent disabilities, lost of properties, unlawful incarceration and human rights abuses and violations. “Majority of the citizens believed that the constitution of the panel was merely to douse political tension following the 2020 #EndSars protest. “Government should promptly prove the critics wrong by paying compensations to the petitioners and constitute Human Rights Committee to forestall future occurrences of human rights abuses and violations.” Copyright PUNCH.
