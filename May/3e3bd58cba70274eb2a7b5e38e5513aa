Operatives of the Rapid Response have arrested four fake revenue officials for extorting N50, 000 from a female motorist in Lagos. The men were said to have posed as officials of the disbanded Lagos State Committee on the Removal of Abandoned Vehicles and impounded the vehicle of the motorist for ‘changing lanes’ at Alausa, Lagos, on Thursday. In a statement by the state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, on Friday, two of the suspects, Adedire and Osunkoya, apprehended by the Police, had in 2020, defrauded a professor at the Lagos State University. The Lagos Commissioner of Police, CP Abiodun Alabi, has directed the Commander, RRS, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi, to charge the suspects to court at the conclusion of investigations. “The motorist stated that the suspects took her vehicle to a park in front of Elephant Cement House, where she was asked to pay N50,000 as a fine. She, however, reached out to friends who contacted the Rapid Response Squad (RRS). “The RRS arrived at the scene promptly, arrested the suspects and commenced preliminary investigations. While the investigation was ongoing, their leader, one Taiwo Falodun, came along with a government official, identified as Olalekan Edu to solicit the release of the arrested suspects. They were both arrested too. “RRS fingerprint records showed that Taiwo Falodun and Adedire Olaniyi were once arrested in 2020 for extorting a university professor while posing as local government officials on LASU-Igando Road” the statement read in part.
