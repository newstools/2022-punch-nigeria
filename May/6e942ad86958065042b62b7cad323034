The embattled Rivers State governorship aspirant of the Peoples’ Democratic Party, Honourable Farah Dagogo has dragged his party, and the Independent National Electoral Commission to court over his alleged exclusion from the list of governorship aspirants in the State. Dagogo in a motion on notice filed at the Federal High Court, Abuja, sought an order of interlocutory injunction restraining the PDP from using any list of aspirants without his name to conduct the May 26 primary election pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit. The federal lawmaker is also seeking an order restraining INEC from accepting any candidate who might emerge from the primary election conducted without his participation. Six lawyers, B.A. Adegbie, M. Dayi, A.M. Idoghor, H. Amrurhobo, Dickson Sofiyegha and Erica Akpofure, filed the action on behalf of Dagogo. Dagogo, a serving member of the House of Representatives, representing the Degema-Bonny federal constituency was arrested, charged to court, and initially detained in police custody. He was standing trial on two counts of conspiracy to felony and cultism in a State High Court, but pleaded not guilty to the charges and had yet to be granted bail. But a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt had granted him bail and issued a restraining order to the police and other parties not to re-arrest him. The governorship hopeful was currently remanded to the Port Harcourt Correctional Centre on the orders of the State High Court. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
