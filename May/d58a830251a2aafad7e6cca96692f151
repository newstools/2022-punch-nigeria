Sharing a screenshot from the chart on his Twitter page on Wednesday, the Mavin boss noted that being in the no. 1 spot was not an easy feat. He appreciated fans and especially hailed Wizkid for co-signing the song. Don Jazzy tweeted, “Na Baba God dey run am. This No 1 was not easy at all. Shout out to the Mavin team. Shout out to the Mavin fans. Shout out to Big Wiz for the timely co-sign. We appreciate you all.

Crayon had on Tuesday shared a video where the song was playing in the background and Wizkid commented, “If I marry, play this song.” When Don Jazzy reposted the video on his Instagram page, Wizkid also commented, “my jam”, with love emojis. Shortly after Don Jazzy announced that the song had reached the no.1 spot, Wizkid also shared an Instagram story with the song in the background. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
