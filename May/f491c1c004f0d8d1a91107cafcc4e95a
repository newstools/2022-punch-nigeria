The Nasarawa State Police Command said it has begun a manhunt for the abductors of the Executive Chairman of the Keffi Local Government Area of the state, Muhammad Shehu. Shehu was kidnapped along with his driver by yet-to-be-identified gunmen along the Keffi-Akwanga road on Friday. Our correspondent gathered that the council chairman was travelling with his driver and a police orderly when the gunmen mounted roadblocks along the road and shot indiscriminately in the air, forcing them to stop their vehicle before they were kidnapped. A source said that the police orderly made efforts to repel the attack but was shot dead by the attackers. “We received information that the executive chairman was coming from a programme organised by Old Boys Association of the Government College, Keffi, when his vehicle was attacked. “His police orderly made efforts to handle the situation but he was shot dead by the gunmen before they were able to take the chairman and his driver away,” the source added. Confirming the attack on Saturday, the Commissioner of Police, Adesina Soyemi, said policemen had taken over the location of the attack to rescue the victims and arrest the kidnappers. “Policemen are now in the area where they were kidnapped. We have taken over the environment and I can assure you that they will soon be rescued and the perpetrators of the act will not escape the wrath of the law,” Soyemi added. Copyright PUNCH.
