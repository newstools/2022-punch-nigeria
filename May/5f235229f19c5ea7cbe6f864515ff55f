The race to fill the vacant stool of the Alaafin of Oyo has begun with at least 20 princes from the Owoade Ruling Family signifying their interest to succeed Oba Lamidi Adeyemi. Owoade Ruling Family is one of the two ruling families under the Agunloye Ruling House, according to the Mogaji of the family, Prince Adediwura Owoade. The Mogaji said this in an interview with our correspondent on Thursday. He said the family had opened a register for all interested members of the family to write their names and submit their curriculum vitae. He said the family would invite the vice-chancellor of one of the universities around to screen the names with the aim of presenting the best applicant to the Oyo Mesi, who are the kingmakers. He said the family had been cheated for so long but was now ready to ensure that one of its princes ascends the throne. Owoade said, “Twenty princes from Owoade Ruling Family have indicated their interest in becoming the next Alaafin. But like I told you we will screen them and present the best. “All of them are my children. Everybody who is contesting from Owoade family is my son. We are one family. We met it like that and we want it to remain like that. “I want to stress this that whoever is picked from Owoade family will work for the development of the town and we are ready to settle any rift with anybody in Oyo. We are for peace and whatever may be the cause of such fight, we are ready to settle it. We want unity in Oyo, we want Oyo be one in order to enhance development and security.” The stool became vacant following the death Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, on April 22 at the age of 83.
