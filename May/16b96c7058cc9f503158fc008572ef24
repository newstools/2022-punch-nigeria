Mr Larry Esin has joined the race to pick the 2023 Akwa Ibom State governorship ticket of the All Progressives Congress, saying zoning has failed in the state. According to a statement on Tuesday, Esin, who hails from the Oro ethnic nationality, declared his governorship ambition over the weekend. He lamented that Akwa Ibom is now more divided than before. He said the ditching of power-sharing among ethnic nationalities in the state by today’s politicians had resulted in great disunity in the state. “Zoning as it stands now in Akwa Ibom has failed. It was supposed to engender ethnic inclusion, but the state is now more divided than before,”  he said. Esin pledged to restore the lost hope of citizens and revive ailing sectors of the state economy. The aspirant who averred that governorship is not a white-collar responsibility, but a blue-collar job said his government would partner with various communities for accelerated and even development of the state. He further expressed his commitment to ICT, tourism development, and agriculture which will form the front row of his administration if he gets elected governor of Akwa Ibom. In a related development, the Chairman of APC Alliance, a grassroots leadership initiative within the party, has passed a vote of confidence on the Stephen Ntukekpo- led state executive of the party. In a statement issued in Uyo, APC Alliance Chairman. Ime Mbom, said the collaborative efforts of stakeholders are needed to win the general elections for the APC in Akwa Ibom in 2023.
