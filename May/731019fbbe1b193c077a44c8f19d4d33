The Anambra State Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, has condemned the reported killing of a woman and her children by some yet-to-be-identified gunmen in the state. The governor described the killing as unacceptable while promising that the perpetrators would be fished out and dealt with according to law. Some unidentified gunmen had on Sunday invaded the home of the woman and opened fire on them, thereby killing her and her four children. The governor expressed his displeasure and reaction in a statement signed by his Press Secretary, Christian Aburime, on Wednesday. According to the governor, all law-abiding citizens, irrespective of tribe, religion or other affiliations, are entitled to reside and or do business in any part of the country, including the South-East and in Anambra State, without any fear of unlawful harassment, molestation or attack of any kind, under any guise by anyone or group. He said, “No group or individual is justified to harass, attack or kill any citizen of Nigeria or anyone resident in Nigeria under any guise whatsoever unless in lawful execution of a court sentence.” While insisting that perpetrators of these heinous atrocities and their sponsors are testing the resolve of the state government and people of Anambra State, Soludo assured that efforts are underway to fish out and bring to justice whoever was behind the criminal activities. He reassured all Nigerians living or doing business in Anambra, of the resolve of the state government to ensure adequate protection of their lives and properties at all times. Copyright PUNCH.
