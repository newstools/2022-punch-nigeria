Ahead of Sunday’s presidential primary election of the All Progressives Congress, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, on Wednesday, concluded his interactive sessions with stakeholders and delegates in all 36 states and Abuja. This was according to a statement signed on Thursday by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, titled, ‘APC 2023 presidential primary: VP Osinbajo concludes interactive sessions with APC delegates, stakeholders in 36 states, FCT.’ Osinbajo, whose last visits were to Benue and Lagos states, had declared his intention to seek the APC’s presidential ticket on Monday, April 11, in a televised and online broadcast which went viral on traditional, digital and social media platforms. According to Akande, the Vice President who began the interactive sessions with the delegates in Ibadan, Oyo State, on Friday, April 22, lasted over a month. The consultations, he said, involved robust question-and-answer sessions while also discussing and exchanging ideas on various national issues, such as security, economy, technology, education, health, youth, women empowerment, social investments, national development, governance and politics. In a related development, a group has set up a grassroots-based crowdfunding portal to propagate Osinbajo’s candidacy. The portal, pyoglobalpartners.com, was launched by PYO Global Partners.
