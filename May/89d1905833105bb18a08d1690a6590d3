Nigeria international left-back Jamilu Collins has said he is pleased to make a permanent transfer to English Championship outfit Cardiff City on a two-year deal, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The 27-year-old joined the Bluebirds on a free transfer as his contract with German second-tier side SC Paderborn expires this summer says his dream is to help Steve Morison’s side gain promotion to the Premier League. “I’m really excited to be in Cardiff, and I can’t wait to get started,” he told the club website. “The club has great history, and when I got the call to come to Cardiff, I was so excited, I couldn’t resist. I’m looking forward to the challenge of the new season. “The goal is to fight for the Premier League.” Collins becomes Cardiff manager Steve Morison’s fourth signing of the close season. Cardiff also signed Jak Alnwick, Ebou Adams and Ollie Tanner. Speaking on his arrival, Morison said, “We’ve been monitoring him for a long period, and we’re really pleased to get him signed. “He’s a great athlete, a really good left-back, and can play in that left wing-back position as well. I’m really pleased that we’ve got competition for places. “I want to get as many bodies in for the start of pre-season, because the first 10 days of pre-season are going to be huge.” Collins will provide Joel Bagan with competition for the left-back spot in Morison’s side, while he can also operate in midfield or central defence. The Nigerian defender helped Paderborn reach the Bundesliga thanks to successive promotions in 2017-18 and 2018-19, although they were relegated after one season in the top flight. He made 137 appearances during five years at Paderborn.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
