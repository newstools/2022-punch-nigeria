The factional candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party for the July 16 governorship election in Osun State, Prince Dotun Babayemi, has enjoined members of the party to support the Eyitayo Jegede-led Reconciliation Committee. The reconciliation committee was put in place by the PDP national headquarters to resolve lingering differences in the party. Babayemi made the call on Saturday in a statement by the  Director of Media, Omooba Dotun Babayemi Campaign Organisation, Kayode Oladeji. He said it had become imperative for members of the party to rally round the committee, so as to foster the needed unity in the party, especially as the state governorship election drew nearer. “The reconciliation committee appointed by the national leadership of our party to settle some grey spots within our party can only succeed if we all support them; our support will also bring about the needed peace and unity amongst members of the party in the state. “We must leave nothing to chance; no stone must be left unturned in making sure we get to our desired point through meaningful resolutions. Nobody can ever clap with one hand. We are one big indivisible PDP family poised for a mission of bringing sanity to Osun through purposeful governance,” Babayemi said. Copyright PUNCH.
