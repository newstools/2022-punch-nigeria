The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church Of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has paid a visit to Imo State. The governor of the state, Hope Uzodimma, who played host to the cleric, described the visit as a “prophetic mission for divine intervention”. Uzodimma announced Adeboye’s visit late Friday, as he also appreciated the octogenarian for supporting the state. Uzodimma said, “It’s a pleasure welcoming the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch A. Adeboye and his religious team as they visit Imo State on a prophetic mission for divine intervention in the challenges confronting us. “In the course of our fight against insecurity and related menace, we have never failed in seeking divine intervention. For as Christians, we are admonished to pray without ceasing, in all circumstances. “May I, on behalf of the Government and good people of Imo State, express a profound gratitude to Daddy GO and the Redeemed Christian Church of God for their support and prayers in the stability of our dear State and the Nation at large. “Rest assured of Imo State’s hospitality and a secured partnership in this mission.” Copyright PUNCH.
