A presidential aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party and former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, has dumped the party. In a letter addressed to the National Chairman of the party, Senator Iyorchia Ayu, titled ‘Resignation From Peoples Democratic and Withdrawal From the Presidential Contest’, the former governor said he was happy to have contributed to the nation-building efforts of the country through the PDP. The letter partly read, “I am writing to intimate you of my resignation from the Peoples Democratic Party,  which was conveyed to the Chairman of Agulu Ward 2, Anaocha LGA, Anambra, effective Friday, May 20, 2022. “Consequently, I am by this letter informing you of my withdrawal from the PDP Presidential Primaries “It has been a great honour to contribute to nation-building efforts through our party. Unfortunately, recent developments within our party make it practically impossible to continue participating and making such constructive contributions.” Obi thanked the National Chairman of the party for his leadership and wished him well in the service of the country.
