A Kano political group, Kungiyar Rama Alheri Ga Masoya, has urged a former Director-General of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking In Persons, Bashir Lado, to come back and contest the Kano Central Senatorial District seat in 2023. The state coordinator of the group, Aminu Giwa, made the call Thursday while addressing party supporters in Kano. He said the group had decided to request the senator to contest the Kano Central senatorial seat because of the numerous development projects he brought to Kano when he was a senator during the Seventh National Assembly. “It’s on record that Senator Lado brought Kano over 100 constituency projects while in the Seventh Senate, which covered health, education, infrastructure and many others. “He brought the N3 billion Kundila flyover bridge in Kano where we are standing now, which the Kano people named Gadar Lado (Lado bridge). “Another big project is the N16 billion 174km Kano-Katsina road dualisation. Before, the road was a terrible single lane which caused a lot of accidents,” he said. According to Giwa, the group had resolved to support him to recontest the senatorial seat. The group, therefore, called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Abdullahi Adamu, the national leader of the APC, Bola Tinubu, and Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State to support Lado to contest the Kano Central senatorial seat in 2023. The group also called on the people of Kano Central senatorial district to support Senator Lado to return to the Senate and continue the good work he had been doing. Copyright PUNCH.
