The Founder of Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti, Chief Afe Babalola, has charged the Federal Government to give universities adequate funding to carry out innovation research. Babalola said universities were established for learning and research, hence the need to undertake research works for innovations that would improve the economy and redress the country’s present situation. The ABUAD founder spoke in Ado Ekiti at a Research and Innovation Conference with the theme, “The 2030 and 2063 Sustainable Development Goals: Our common future.” He said, “Innovation fosters economic growth, enhances job creation, curbs crisis. Nigeria was rated the world’s poverty capital because it is not innovative and doesn’t do research that can generate wealth. “Research and innovations are key in tertiary institutions and society. Nigeria was not a poor country when I was born. Employment generation is just 8%. We have to look at the structure of this country if we want to get it right.” A former Vice-Chancellor, Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba, Ondo State, Prof. Femi Mimiko, said leadership was key to the realisation of the SDGs’ focus in the African continent. Mimiko said the kernel of the SDGs’ policy was to bail over one billion persons out of poverty globally, saying Africa remained one of the continents where poverty remained high, which he said accounted for its low performance on the SDGs’ scale.
