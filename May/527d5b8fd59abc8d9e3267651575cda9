No fewer than three have been confirmed dead, and two persons critically injured as a shop collapsed in an Ebonyi community market. It was learnt that the roof of one of the open market stalls in the market caved in on Friday evening. The incident, it was further learnt, took place at Ekeaja Market Square, Uburu, in the Ohaozara Local Government Area of the state, hometown of Governor David Umahi. The governor confirmed the incident in a statement on Saturday by his Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Nwaze Francis. Umahi, in the statement, expressed displeasure over the tragic incident. The statement read in part, “The Governor of Ebonyi State, David Nweze Umahi, has received with rude shock the disturbing and unfortunate news of the toppling of a part of the roof of one of the shades at the Ekeaja Market, Uburu which resulted in the loss of about three lives while two others were hospitalised.” Umahi, who described the occurrence as catastrophic, sympathised with the families of the three persons who lost their lives. “As mortals, we cannot question God but we pray fervently for God Almighty to grant the victims rest in his bosom and comfort their families. “We however pray that God Almighty grants the hospitalised survivors quick recovery and reintegration with their families.” Copyright PUNCH.
