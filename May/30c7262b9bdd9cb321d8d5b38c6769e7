Fast-rising singer, Chukwuka Ekweani, popularly known as Ckay, is the only Nigerian to make the 2022 Time‘s Next Generation Leaders list. This was announced by Times on their official website on Thursday. The Time‘s Next Generation Leaders list recognises young people from across fields and around the globe “who are working to build a better world”. Time described Ckay as one of the most successful African recording artists ever on a global scale. Speaking in an interview with the magazine about one of his most successful songs, ‘Love Nwatiti’, Ckay said, “If an artist makes something from his soul, people can tell, regardless of how fast or slow it is, or whether or not it fits trends.” ‘Love Nwatiti’ garnered over two billion views on TikTok and 500 million more on YouTube. The song has also charted in six continents, hitting No. 1 in India, Norway, and Switzerland. The singer is expected to release his debut album later this year. Other leaders round the world who made the list this year include the youngest member of Mongolia’s Cabinet, Bolor-Erdene Battsengel; South African beauty entrepreneur, Deepica Mutyala, and a host of many others.
