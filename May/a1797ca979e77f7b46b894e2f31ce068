The APC has shifted its presidential primary originally slated for May 30  to June 6 and 7 following the decision of the Independent National Electoral Commission to extend the deadline for the conduct of primaries by political parties to June 9, according to TVC. However, a source in the party said, “With this new deadline, the party has shifted the presidential primary again by a few days. This will be communicated in due course. It (shift) will also allow people enough time to travel down Saturday PUNCH reports that the party has yet to prepare the Eagle Square venue for the primary. One of our correspondents, who visited the Eagle Square, observed a team of soldiers and policemen patrolling the premises. When he attempted to move into the venue, he was accosted at the gate by one of the local security men. The guard, who claimed that he had been ordered not to allow anybody access into the venue, confirmed that the uniformed security operatives were having their routine drill ahead of the planned convention. Saturday PUNCH also observed seven patrol vans and one armoured personnel carrier were stationed not too far from the access road leading to the venue. According to the guard, many officers in the security team were drawn from the anti-bomb squad of the Nigeria Police Force, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps and the Department of State Services, among others.
