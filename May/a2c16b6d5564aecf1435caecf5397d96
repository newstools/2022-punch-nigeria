A 45-year-old businessman, Ifeanyi Odii, has emerged the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in Ebonyi State. The business mogul polled 349 votes while his closest rival got nine votes in the election which took place at the PDP secretariat in Abakaliki, located along the Abakaliki/Enugu Expressway, on Sunday. Two other aspirants who are members of the House of Representatives, Sylvester Ogbaga and Chukwuma Nwazunku, got one vote each. According to a statement on Monday, Odii was declared winner of the election by the governorship committee chairman for Ebonyi State, Rotimi Olalekan, who described the exercise as transparent. Giving his acceptance speech, Odii promised to help the PDP to reclaim its mandate which was taken away by the current governor, David Umahi, who defected to the All Progressives Congress in November 2020. He reiterated his desire to keep his campaign promises and “identify growth opportunities and allocate scarce resources for maximum returns.”  Contact: theeditor@punchng.com Copyright PUNCH.
