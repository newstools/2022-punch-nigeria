A group canvassing support for the presidential ambition of former Lagos State governor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, on Thursday urged the All Progressives Congress not to pick a wrong candidate as its presidential flag bearer in the next general election. The group named ‘Bola Ahmed Tinubu Our Choice 2023’ then lauded the proposed meeting of the South West elders in All Progressives Congress and presidential aspirants from the region. This was contained in a statement signed by the Director of Media and Publicity of the group, Abimbola Tooki, obtained in Osogbo. The statement welcomed the move to unite all APC aspirants, noting that the outcome of the meeting should build a united front ahead of the 2023 general elections. It added, “The party should not make a mistake in the forthcoming presidential election, but to go for a candidate who can unite the people and develop the country.” While urging the conveners of the meeting to build a united front for the South West to take over power from the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in 2023, it advised that internal wrangling and crisis will not help APC to achieve its desired result in the next presidential election.
