The All Progressives Congress in Delta State is now more united and hungry for power in the 2023 general election, the party’s Senatorial candidate for Delta South Senatorial District, Thomas Joel-Onowakpo has said. Joel-Onowakpo, a former Chairman of Delta State Board of Internal Revenue, made the assertion in a chat with journalists shortly after his affirmation as the party’s senatorial candidate on Saturday. He insisted that there are no more threats of factions within the party in Delta State. While conceding that some party leaders might still be exercising disagreements “on different grounds”, Joel-Onowakpo maintained that such should not be insinuated to be factionalising the party in the state. He declared, “There are no factions in APC in Delta. The APC we have in the state today is far better than the APC we had in 2018. The only thing you may want to say is that we have party leaders who are disagreeing on different grounds. “What could have been regarded as the biggest factions that we had in the Delta APC was the Leaders Council and the group mobilising support for the Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege. But today, the two groups have collapsed their structures to work together as one. “So, (the) APC is now more united in Delta State than ever before. The APC we have today is poised to win the 2023 general election in the state. The APC today is hungry for power, for success. We are very united and we are poised to win the forthcoming general election, by God’s grace.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
