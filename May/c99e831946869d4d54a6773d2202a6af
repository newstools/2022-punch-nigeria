The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has, once again, uncovered another N90 billion alleged fraud involving the suspended Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris. Idris, who was seeking bail last night, had reportedly opened up on some top government officials allegedly involved in some transactions. Further expanding the scope of the ongoing probe of the suspended AGF by the EFCC, the latest revelation made the alleged money laundering involving Idris, former governor of Zamfara State, Abdul-Azeez Yari, a total of N170 billion. The PUNCH had reported that Yari was arrested by the anti-graft agency at about 5 pm, Sunday evening, and taken into custody. The EFCC had also grilled a Permanent Secretary in connection with some “deals in which he was implicated.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
