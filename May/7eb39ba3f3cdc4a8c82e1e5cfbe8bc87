PUNCH Metro gathered the assailants also killed a security guard and burnt down Orugwu’s family house. It was learnt that the council boss was not at home when the gunmen struck. A reliable source told our correspondent that the hoodlums invaded the chairman’s home in Ekpaomaka late on Tuesday night. Orogwu confirmed the incident to journalists on Wednesday. He said, “They attacked my family compound at Ikwo at night and killed my elder brother, two of his sons and a security guard.” He explained that the gunmen also set ablaze the house in the compound.
