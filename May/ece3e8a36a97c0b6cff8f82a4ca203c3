No fewer than 400 serving officers who sought inter-cadre transfer to fill up vacancies in some ministries, departments and agencies in Ogun State have been shortlisted after passing all the three stages of the Public Service Competitive Selection Process. According to a  release signed by the Permanent Secretary, Civil Service Commission, Mr Adedayo Somoye, the process was to address the shortage of staff in some cadres within the civil service. The staff, according to the statement, had attained higher academic qualifications through their personal self-development efforts and were qualified for the entire process. The Press Officer, Ogun State Civil Service Commission, Mrs Fatimah Alatishe, also revealed that those who participated in the previous upgrading examination but were not successful were given the opportunity to re-sit in order to enjoy career progression in the available vacant posts. It would be recalled that the Commission released names of over 600 candidates who all passed the three stages of the Public Service Competitive Selection Process for officers upgrading into both professional and sub-professional cadres. Somoye added that the exercise was to encourage workers in the state to develop themselves in relevant fields for service delivery, as it would enable them to progress in their chosen careers. He said that the present administration was doing a lot to improve workers’ productivity and deployment in areas of critical needs.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
