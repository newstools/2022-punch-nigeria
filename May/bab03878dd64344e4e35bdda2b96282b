The Managing Director, Dove Buka plus Bakers, Adewale Ajani Isola, has called on government at all levels to encourage local wheat production to bridge the supply gap on account of the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Isola, who spoke at the opening ceremony of the firm’s new outlet in the Lekki area of Lagos recently, said the government had to intervene, given the rising cost of bread, a major staple in the country. Isola said, “Eighty per cent of the raw materials for baking are sourced locally apart from wheat which comes from Ukraine. That’s the major challenge now because it affects flour supply. Bread is a staple and the government has to come in. “Our government can go into wheat production. There is no grain that our land and weather cannot support. Government should also provide the enabling environment for interested participants through loan facilities.” President of the African Development Bank, Dr Akinwumi Adesina, said about a week ago that the cost of bread was now beyond the reach of many Africans due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Isola however noted that his motivation for going into food business despite being an architect was the desire to encourage healthy nutrition among Nigerians. “People must eat and we are here to make our products accessible, affordable and available; the health of the people is our focus,” he added. The Project Consultant, Olomu Solomon, also said, “Bread will be part of our major foods and we intend to infuse the local dishes in our restaurants.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
