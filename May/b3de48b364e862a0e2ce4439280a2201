The Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria says it has flagged a Glo dial *109# “Link your NIN” commercial featuring a female model (Odas Ighodaro). A statement by the apex advertising regulatory agency, signed by its President, Olalekan Fadolapo, said the campaign, which was sponsored by Globacom Limited, was currently being aired on some TV stations and social media platforms. It said the advert, targeted at the Nigerian market, had elicited complaints about the exposure of the model’s cleavage. The statement added the APCON had written to Glo, asking the telecom firm to stop further exposure of the advert or face punitive measures from the agency. The statement read in part, “The advertisement was neither submitted not approved for exposure by the Advertising Standards Panel, the statutory body charged with the responsibility of ensuring that advertisement confirm with the prevailing laws of the federation as well as the Code of Ethics of Advertising in Nigeria.” Copyright PUNCH.
