Former Super Eagles World Cup coach Adegboye Onigbinde and President-General, Nigeria Football Supporters Club, Dr Rafiu Ladipo, have jointly said legendary Nigerian footballer Teslim ‘Thunder’ Balogun was a successful footballer because of the contribution and support of his wife, the late Alhaja Mulikat Teslim Balogun. The Balogun family celebrated the 24th memorial anniversary of Mulikat in Ikorodu, Lagos on Wednesday (today). Onigbinde said the legendary footballer might not have gone the distance he went, if he had married another wife. The former NFF Technical Director  noted that far back as 1958, it was Mulikat, who then Premier of the Western Region, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, sought audience with to convince her husband to dump his British club, Queens Park Rangers, to return to Nigeria to assist the West Rovers  to win the  Challenge Cup. “Mulikat convinced her husband and he returned to help the club win the title,” Onigbinde said. Ladipo added, “If there were top decisions made by Teslim Balogun that lifted him to become one of Nigeria’s greatest footballers of all time, they were due to the influence of his wife, who stood firmly by him with humour, humility and discipline. She accompanied her husband to all his training sessions when he finally returned to Nigeria. She was always there to quietly point out areas where her husband didn’t do well in training and this helped tremendously during competitive games.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
