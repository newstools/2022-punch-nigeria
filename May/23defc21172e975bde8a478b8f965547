Some terrorists were reported to have invaded Kurmin Sata, some few kilometers away from Millennium City in the Chikun Local Government Area of the state, killing one person and abducted about 20 residents of the area. An official of the Joint Task Force who spoke on condition of anonymity said the attack took place in the early hours of Saturday. The official added that four out of the 20 person abducted by the terrorists escaped, adding that those who escaped included two women and two men. “Among those kidnapped, according to the official, were the village head of the community and a chief. “They killed one person and kidnapped 20. When they stormed the village, the terrorists were shooting indiscriminately and in the process the bullet hit one and he died on the spot,” the JTF official said. Eyewitnesses said the police from the Millennium division had since visited the scene of the incident. The state police command had yet to confirm the attack as of the time of filing this report. When contacted, the command’s spokesperson, Mohammed Jalige, couldn’t be reached and a call to his mobile was not responded. He had also yet to reply to a text message sent to his mobile at the time this report was filed. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
