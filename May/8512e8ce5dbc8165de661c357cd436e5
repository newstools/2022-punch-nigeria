The All Progressive Grand Alliance presidential aspirant, Prof. Peter Umeadi, has promised to promote the overall good of every Nigerian if elected president in the 2023 general elections. Umeadi, a former Anambra State Chief Judge, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria in Enugu on Saturday. He said that his administration would not pursue personal or group interest if elected. “My administration will not pursue personal or group interest over the aspirations that will edify every Nigerian, irrespective of ethnicity. “I pledge to administer Nigeria with firmness and fairness to ensure progress, harmony and prosperity,” Umeadi said. He said his presidency would uphold political and financial accountability to the people. Umeadi added that his administration would judiciously expend resources to provide basic amenities for all Nigerians to reposition the country on the path of greatness. According to him, his presidency will surmount the country’s pertinent developmental challenges. “What is important to take up the job of the President of Nigeria is the right frame of mind. “And the mindset to expeditiously overcome the developmental challenges bedeviling Nigeria is what I am bringing into the office,” he said. The former Chief Judge added that his presidency would take repositioning of the country’s judiciary and judicial system seriously. “My presidency will improve the judicial arm of government and our judicial system by strict application and adherence to principles of law, separation of powers and due process.”
