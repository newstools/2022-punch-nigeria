The West African Examinations Council, Nigeria, has said the West African Senior School Certificate Examination for 2022, will take place between May 16 and June 23, 2022 in Nigeria. Speaking at a press briefing on Monday, Head of Nigeria Office, WAEC, Mr Patrick Areghan, advised students to shun examination malpractice and study hard. He said, “I call on parents and guardians to admonish their wards to study hard and desist from engaging in any form of examination malpractice.  The mass media must play its watch-dog role. “The various Ministries of Education should call their principals, teachers and other officials serving as inspectors to order.  Every candidate and examination functionary must play by the rules which are well stipulated in the WAEC syllabus and guidelines for the conduct of examinations issued to schools. Erring schools will be derecognised; erring officials will be adequately punished while erring candidates will lose their results, no matter whose ox is gored. “I want to specifically warn supervisors to desist from aiding and abetting examination malpractice by assisting candidates in one way or the other, especially by allowing them to enter the examination hall with their cell phones and make use of the same. This is shameful and indecorous. We shall fish them out and deal with them. All hands must be on deck to sanitise the educational sector.” Areghan revealed that the exam would take a period of six weeks, adding that the reversion to the May/June period for the conduct of the examination should be celebrated.” Copyright PUNCH.
