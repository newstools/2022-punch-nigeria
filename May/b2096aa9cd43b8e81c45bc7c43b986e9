The Osun State Police Command on Friday confirmed the arrest of three people suspected to be workers at a mining site in connection with the killing of a farmer in the Iberekodo community of the state. The deceased, whose name was simply given as Ajewole, was reportedly killed following a disagreement with the labourers, who stormed his farm without permission and started mining. A resident in the community who spoke on condition of anonymity said Ajewole resisted the attempt by the illegal miners to take over his farmland but was shot dead during a scuffle with the invaders. Contacted by our correspondent, the state police spokesperson, Yemisi Opalola, confirmed that three people had been arrested in connection with the crime. She said, “It is true that the man was killed. Three people have been arrested in connection with the crime. Those arrested are being quizzed by the operatives. Investigation is still on. We are going to ensure justice is served. Those arrested are still with the police.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
