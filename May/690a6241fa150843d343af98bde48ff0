Chairman of Tuns Group of Companies, Dr Olatunde Badmus, on Monday, said having many Yoruba men in the race for presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress may divide voters in South-West region. Badmus, who is the Asiwaju Musulumi Of Yorubaland, Edo and Delta, spoke in his residence in Osogbo during Eid-el-Fitri celebration on Monday. The businessman said Yoruba people being an important race in the country should not be divided over APC presidential ticket. He said, “Yoruba race is an important race in Nigeria. But from just one race, you have about seven of our children come out and say they want to be president, whereas there is only one seat. “Is that not a way to divide about 12 to 13 million votes that we have here in Yorubaland? We know ourselves. We know those who have contributed to our wellbeing. “Only God knows who will be the next president but I will advise that we Yoruba should not divide our votes. It won’t pay us.” Asked if he and other Yoruba elders would take step and prevail on some of the aspirants to drop their ambitions and unite behind one person, Badmus said, “Politicians have ego but by the time they go for their primaries, one person will emerge. “The stage they are now, each of them believes he is going to win. And who among them will admit he can’t win?” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
