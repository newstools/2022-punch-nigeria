A former Governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari, said his decision to reconcile with Governor Bello Matawalle was in the interest of the people. Speaking with Journalists in his residence in Talata-Mafara on Monday, Yari said he did not reconcile with Matawalle because of any political position. He said, “I didn’t reconcile with Governor Matawalle simply because I want to attain a certain political position. But having thought of the implications of our sour relationship with the people of the state, I realise that, reconciliation is the best option. “It is often said that when two elephants fight, it is the grass that will suffer, as such, we have decided to close our ranks and come together to move our state forward.” He, therefore, called on his supporters to embrace the reconciliation process and work together with Matawalle’s loyalists in order to move the state forward. Yari stressed that he would soon organise a town hall meeting with his supporters in order to enlighten them on the importance of the reconciliation. Meanwhile, thousands of APC stakeholders have been trouping to the former governor’s residence to express their support for the reconciliation process. Among those who visited Yari were the state and the federal lawmakers, the Secretary to the State Government, Head of Service and Commissioners. Others were the Permanent Secretaries, Directors General and Heads of parastatals. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
