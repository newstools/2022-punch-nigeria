The Majority Leader of the House, Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, who is representing Doguwa/Tudun Wada Federal Constituency in Kano State, has got the ticket of the All Progressives Congress unopposed to contest in the 2023 general elections. Ado-Doguwa, who was a member of the House in the defunct Third Republic, and returned to the parliament in the current Fourth Republic, will be seeking reelection for the seventh term. He is arguably the most ranking member of the House. In 1992, he was elected to the House where he made history by becoming the first Nigerian to be sworn in as a member immediately after completing his national youth service. “This is my 7th mandate, to run for the House of Reps unopposed, without any contention,” the lawmaker told our correspondent, while appreciating the leaders and members of the APC in his constituency and Kano State by extension for their support. Also, the lawmaker representing Nasarawa Federal Constituency in Kano State at the House, Nassir Ali Ahmed, won the primary to clinch the ticket of the APC. Ahmed, who is Chairman of the House Committee on Public Procurement, is seeking reelection for a fourth term. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
