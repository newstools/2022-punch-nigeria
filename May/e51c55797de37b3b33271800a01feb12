The Abuja Centre Coordinator of the Joint Admissions Matriculation Board Equal Opportunity Group, Prof. Sunday Ododo, says no fewer than 383 candidates with visual impairment and other forms of disabilities sat the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination. Ododo, who is also the General Manager/Chief Executive Officer of the National Theatre, Iganmu, Lagos State, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Friday in Abuja. He said the physically-challenged candidates experienced no difficulties taking the exam, as typewriters, computers and Braille devices, among other materials were available for their use. “However, there are few exceptions; there are those that are not blind but scared to write examination, like those with Down Syndrome and autism. “In their case, we brought examiners to read questions to their hearing and allow them to produce the answers and the examiner helped to write them down or the candidate could Braille them down.”
