The Rector, Osun State Polytechnic, Iree, Dr. Woye Olaniran, has announced the invention of a data capturing machine for voters’ registration by some students of the institution. Olaniran, who disclosed this during a press briefing heralding the combined 7th convocation ceremony of the polytechnic held in Osogbo on Tuesday, also said the data capturing machine was part of many inventions by students and lecturers of the institution that would be exhibited as part of the activities for the convocation. According to him, the data capturing machine could detect multiple registration. When tested using his data, it revealed that he had previously registered. He said the management would patent the invention and present it to the Independent National Electoral Commission for possible collaboration. “Our students developed a machine that can register voters. They attempted to register me when being tested, and the machine confirmed that I had registered earlier. It is an invention that, after we patent it, we will take to INEC.”  Copyright PUNCH.
