…as Nigerians excel in collegiate games NIGERIAN sprinter Favour Ofili ran a blistering 10.93secs in the women’s 100m on Saturday at the LSU Invitational at the Bernie Moore Track Stadium, Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, LA to win the event and move up to No.8 on the all-time collegiate list. Ofili, 19, who set a new Nigerian national record in the 200m earlier this year, was running the 100m for the second straight meet. She burst out of the blocks on the way to setting a wind legal personal best of 10.93secs in the event to win the title, beating three Olympic and world medalists Mikiah Brisco (10.98), Aleia Hobbs (11.11) and Jenna Prandini (11.15) in the process. Ofili’s 10.93 moves her up to No.4 as Nigeria’s fastest female 200m runner behind Blessing Okagbare (10.79), Chioma Ajunwa (10.84) and Gloria Alozie (10.90). With her feat, she’s overtaken Mary Onyali (10.97), Damola Osayomi (10.99) and Mercy Nku/Gloria Asumnu (11.03). Also, she is now the No.5 in Africa, fifth fastest woman in LSU history, eighth fastest in collegiate history, and the time ranks her as the fourth fastest wind legal time in the world this season. Another Nigerian Favour Ashe, a University of Tenneessee freshman, was also in devastating form in the men’s 100m, running 9.79secs with a 3.0 m/s tail wind. It is the fifth-fastest all-conditions time in collegiate history in the men’s 100m. World U20 champion in the 400m, Imaobong Nse Uko ran 51.66secs, the second best 400m time of her career, to place third behind Kendall Ellis (51.00) and Rosey Effiong (51.66), daughter of former Nigeria track king, Daniel Effiong. In the men’s 400m, Nathaniel Ezekiel of Baylor University also ran his second fastest 400m time ever, stopping the clock at 46.64secs to place ninth in the final classification. Chinecherem Prosper Nnamdi threw 73.06m to win the men’s javelin event at the meet. Focus had been on the 19-year-old to finally break the Nigerian record of 81.08m set by Pius Bazighe in 1999. Nnamdi was just a centimtre outside the mark when he threw 81.07m at the Michael Johnson Invitational penultimate weekend. At the Corky/Crofoot Shootout meet at the Fuller Track and Field Complex in Lubbock, Texas, Rosemary Chukwuma was also in inspiring form. The 20-year-old legally dipped inside 23secs for the first time in her career to win the 200m race at the event and set a new Texas Tech University record. Her 22.78secs new lifetime best is the 10th-fastest time in the NCAA to be recorded this season, the fifth fastest time in the Big 12 this season, sixth fastest by an African so far this season and third by a Nigerian after Ofili (21.96) and Tobi Amusan (22.66).
