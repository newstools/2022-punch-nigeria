Kano State Governor, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje, on Sunday directed the Head of Service, Usman Muhammad, to oversee the office of Chief of Staff to the Governor with immediate effect. Usman, before his appointment as Head of Service in April, was the Chief of Staff to Ganduje, at the early stage of the administration. The appointment was sequel to the exit of the Chief of Staff, Ali Makoda, who has now pitched his tent with Rabiu Kwankwaso’s New Nigeria People’s Party. According to a statement on Sunday by the state Commissioner for Information, Muhamad Garba, Muhammad’s supervision of the office of Chief of Staff would continue until the appointment of a substantive Chief of Staff. The governor, according to the statement, expressed hope that Muhammad would effectively supervise the office as he had earlier worked in that capacity. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
