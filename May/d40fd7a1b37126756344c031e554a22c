A popular photographer in the Sapele area of Delta State, simply identified as Sunny White, has reportedly been shot dead. PUNCH Metro gathered that the incident happened on Friday at his wife’s store at Otomewo Road by Oboscah Lane. An eyewitness said the killers of the photographer came in an ash colour Toyota Corolla car without number plates and shot at him while he was relaxing at the shop with his kids. “He was relaxing at the shop with kids while his wife was attending to customers. “White is a very respectable young man and he did not deserve to die this way. “With this act, it is obvious that security operatives need to step up their game in the area to stop the continuous assassination of young men,” the witness narrated. The witness said the reason White was killed was yet to be ascertained as of the time of filing this report. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Bright Edafe, on Saturday stated that the killing was not reported to the command. He said, “The matter was not reported to the Command, though, there was a cult clash at the community.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
