A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in Ondo State, Dr.  Abiola Oshodi, has warned the party against engaging in imposition of candidates at the forthcoming primary of the party. The party would be holding its primary this month to elect its flagbearers for the presidential, governorship, state, and National Assemblies elections in 2023. Oshodi, who is an aspirant of the APC  in Owo/Ose Federal Constituency of Ondo State, stated this on Friday, after picking his expression of interest and nomination forms. According to him, the imposition of a candidate on the people does not do any good to the party other than causing crisis in the party. He said, ” I want to appeal to the party leadership in Ondo State to allow the people’s will to prevail as imposition tends to tear the party.” Oshodi, a medical doctor said the Owo/Ose Federal Constituency had not experienced development as a result of the representation, saying the current representative of the constituency had not done well. He added, “My desire is to help in turning the Constituency to an egalitarian one where life shall be made more abundant for the constituents, where no child of school age is deprived of education just because his/her parents could not afford school fees, and where every constituent shall be proud of his/her representative. “I intend to be one of the prime movers in the house by being proactive and be heard loud and clear by not being a bench warmer by lobbying, draw a lot of dividends of democracy to this Federal Constituency”.
