The National Chairman of All Progressives Congress, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, says the ruling party has achieved more feats than any other political party in Nigeria in the last seven years. Adamu spoke on Tuesday in Abuja at the inauguration of screening committees for State House of Assembly aspirants. The party chairman, represented by the Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Abubakar Kyari, stressed that he does not doubt that all the aspirants assembled at the International Conference Centre for screening will carry on with the party’s tradition of excellence. He said, “We can beat our chest seven years after achieving what others have not been able to do. Therefore, this transition is key to leaving a lasting legacy for the President. “We are on the verge of electing new leaders for the post-Buhari era. That is why you are chosen to spearhead it. I do not doubt that we would do just that with the calibre of people I see here. Politics is dynamic, and ambition is dynamic. You will face challenges, but you are there not to succumb to those challenges.” Kyari described the screening of the State House of Assembly as the foundation of all the primaries. “We have just conducted the screening of the governorship, senatorial, and House of Representatives aspirants, but the basic foundation is what you people are going to do, which is the election of local government and state delegates,” he said.
