THE Kaduna State House of Assembly on Tuesday suspended chairmen of two local government areas in the state. They are the Chairman of Chikun Local Government Area, Salasi Musa, and that of Giwa Local Government Area, Abubakar Lawal. The chairmen were said to have been suspended over alleged misappropriation of funds. The decision to suspend the two council chairmen followed a motion by member representing Zaria Kewaye Constituency, Alhaji Ahmed Chokali. The lawmaker said the House could no longer continue to watch while the council chairmen continue to flout the state’s local government guidelines,  stating also that the house would conduct an investigation into the matter. “I stand here to move the motion that this house should conduct an investigation under Section 128 of the constitution to investigate the affairs of the two local government areas,” he added. While urging the House to suspend the chairmen in order to conduct investigation,  Chokali directed  the chairmen to handover the affairs of the local governments to their deputies. The Speaker of the House, Alhaji Yusuf Zailani, presided over the sitting where the House directed the House Committee on Local Government to investigate the allegation and report back to the House.
