The Prelate of the Methodist Church Nigeria, Dr. Samuel Kanu-Uche, has urged Nigerians to remain calm in the face of security challenges ravaging the country. Speaking with The PUNCH on Wednesday during his farewell visit to the palace of the Ayangburen of Ikorodu, Oba Kabiru Shotobi (Aderogushen V), Kanu-Uche expressed dissatisfaction over the recent killing of a student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Deborah Samuel, by an irate mob, following allegations of blasphemy against Prophet Muhammed. The Prelate said, “We know there are things that can cause anger, hunger, economic downturns, and other things, but we should be patient with one another. We have no other country than Nigeria, so we should not start killing people. “We should not vent our anger against fellow Nigerians, we should be one another’s keeper, and we should protect one another. That is my message to Nigerians.” The Methodist Church Nigeria, Diocese of Ikorodu, had earlier organised farewell service in honour of the retiring Prelate.. The one-day event kicked off at the palace of the Ayangburen of Ikorodu in Lagos, where church members and dignitaries had converged to welcome the prelate and his entourage, before proceeding for the service and reception at the Patriarch Bolaji Cathedral Church, Ikorodu. Appreciating the prelate’s commitment, Oba Shotobi said, “You have laid the foundation; you have laid the golden eggs, and we’ll continue to live and witness all the good days you had done in the church.” Copyright PUNCH.
