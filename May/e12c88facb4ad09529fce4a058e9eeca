The Managing Director, Old Mutual Nigeria, Mr Olusegun Omosehin, has said that for Nigeria to achieve its Sustainable Development Goals on universal education, uptake of insurance policies will play a critical role. A statement said he spoke in commemoration of the 2022 Children’s Day celebrations in Nigeria. Olusegun expressed concern about the inaccessibility of education to millions of children across the country, and its numerous daunting implications on the affected families, communities, and the nation at large. He noted that the unavailability of a functional educational system for Nigerian children hinders the nation’s contribution to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. The managing director said, “We must understand that our collective future as a nation depends largely on the quality of education available to our children. As the country, which UNICEF ranked the highest rate of out-of-school children in the world, coupled with a population that has rapidly increased over the last decade to an average of 10.5 million, all policymakers in the government and associated stakeholders must commit resources to strengthen our educational system. “While there have been glimpses of improvement recently, with the increase in the allocation to education in the Nigerian budget from 5.2 per cent in 2021 to 7.2 per cent in 2022, there is still a long way to go to attain the global benchmark of countries spending 15-20 per cent of their budgets on education. “As such, if Nigeria is to meet its SDG commitments on education, we must gird our loins to ensure that we meet up with the global best standards on quality education for our children.”  Copyright PUNCH.
