The Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, has announced the immediate lifting of the curfew earlier imposed on the state to curtail the spread of violence in the state. The governor had, in the wake of violence that greeted the peaceful protest organised by youths in the state calling for those arrested in connection with the killing of Deborah Yakubu, declared a curfew in the state metropolis. The notice lifting the curfew was contained in a statement signed by the state’s Commissioner for Information, Isah Galadanci, on behalf of the governor and made available to newsmen on Friday. Deborah was killed and her remains were set on fire following allegations of a blasphemous statement allegedly made by her in her school, Shehu Shagari College of Education WhatsApp group. “Acting on enabling powers under section 176 (2) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, section 1, 2, and 4 of the Public Order Act, and section 15 of Sokoto State Peace Preservation Law, the Governor of Sokoto State, Rt Hon.
