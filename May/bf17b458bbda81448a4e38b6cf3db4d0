Some hoodlums, on Thursday, attacked members of the Federal Capital Territory Administration Task Force at Gaduwa District of Abuja. A police officer was said to have been injured, while other members of the team were taken hostage by the hoodlums during the attack. Those held hostage, it was gathered, were later released, following a rapid response from the rescue team of the FCT Police Command, led by the Deputy Commissioner of Police for Operations, Bernard Igwe. Senior Special Assistant on Monitoring, Inspection and Enforcement to the FCT Minister, Ikharo Attah, confirmed the incident. Attah said that some officials of the Development Control attached to the task force, who went to Gaduwa community to mark for demolition some illegal houses in the community, were heavily resisted and attacked by some persons bearing different dangerous weapons. “I was sent somewhere by the Minister and before I could arrive the scene, the police officer, who was badly injured on the head, and others had been rushed to hospital. “Those who were held hostage were rescued by the rescue team led by DC Bernard Igwe. The area where the indigenous people stay was not marked. The police will determine what happens to those who were arrested.” One of the officials that were held hostage and leader of the Development Control officials, Kalu Amadi, said the experience was horrific and might take some time for him to overcome the psychological trauma. Amadi, who was allegedly stripped half naked, explained that the attackers refused to hear that he was on an official duty, and almost killed him. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
