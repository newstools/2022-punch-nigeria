A motorcyclist, Nura Mohammad, on Thursday lost his life, while two of his passengers were also injured, after a truck ran over them in Agunbelewo community in Osogbo, Osun State. The driver of the truck involved in the accident reportedly fled the scene before the arrival of police operatives. A roadside trader, identified as Mopelola, who was closed to the scene of the accident, told our correspondent that the motorcyclist carrying two passengers, coming from Okinni was heading towards Osogbo when it ran into a commercial minibus that obstructed traffic. She further explained that, “the motorcyclist and his passengers fell on the road after hitting the minibus and the oncoming truck ran over them and injured the three of them. “They were immediately rushed out of the scene to hospital.” When contacted, Osun Police Command Public Relations Officer, Yemisi Opalola, confirmed the accident, adding that the motorcyclist died on his way to hospital. “The other two passengers were receiving treatment at UNIOSUN Teaching Hospital, Osogbo. “Efforts are on to trace the two vehicles involved in the accident because we could not find them when our officers visited the scene,” Opalola said.
