French President Emmanuel Macron, on Monday, named Labour Minister, Elisabeth Borne, as prime minister to lead his ambitious reform plans, the first woman to head the French government in over 30 years. Outgoing French Prime Minister, Jean Castex, earlier handed his resignation to the president, part of a widely expected reshuffle to make way for a new government following Macron’s re-election in April and ahead of legislative elections in June. The centrist Macron will need a legislative majority to push through his domestic agenda following his re-election, with a new left-wing alliance and the far-right threatening to block his programme. The last woman premier, Edith Cresson, briefly headed the cabinet from May 1991 to April 1992 under president Francois Mitterrand.
