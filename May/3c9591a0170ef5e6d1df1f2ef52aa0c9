A Christian cleric, Venerable Olu Obanla, who was abducted few days ago by some gunmen, has regained his freedom. Obanla, along with his son, was reportedly kidnapped along Ifon-Okeluse Road in the Ose Local Government Area of the state on Saturday. After the abduction, the hoodlums were said to have contacted the family of the victims, demanding a sum of N10 million, but the family could not afford the sum. However, it was gathered that the victims had been released on Monday and had reunited with their family. The Police Public Relations Officer of the state, SP Funmilayo Odunlami, confirmed the development and said the victims were already with their family members. She said, “Yes, they have been released yesterday (Monday) around 12:30pm at Edo State.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
