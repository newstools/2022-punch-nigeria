Yahaya stated this in his goodwill message to mark this year’s World Press Freedom Day, through the Director of Press, Government House, Ismaila Misilli, on Tuesday. While referring to the theme of this year’s celebration, ‘Journalism under digital siege’, he underscored the impact of the digital era on the freedom of the press, the security of journalists and access to information, advising them to guard against fake news and misinformation as well as ensure accurate and balanced reportage of events and activities.
