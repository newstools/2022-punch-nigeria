A former Speaker of the Kano State House of Assembly and Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Pension, Kabiru Alhassan Rurum, has announced his defection from the All Progressives Congress. But Senator Barau Jibrin a governorship aspirant of the party in Kano State, who is said to be a disciple of the national leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, denied defection from the party. Rurum, a governorship aspirant in APC, told The PUNCH in a phone interview that the way things were happening in the party showed that some people were hell-bent on choosing their candidates, rather than allowing internal democracy to prevail. He said he had done all he could to ensure that free, fair playing grounds were allowed in the cause of party politicking, adding however that the powers that be in the party prevented that. He said, “It is unfair at this dispensation to deny Kano South the chance to produce the next Governor, hence they have not gotten that chance since 1992. He said he was considering the possibility of joining forces with Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party to ensure that Kano South Senatorial District produced the next Governor. This came as another speculation spread that Senator Barau Jibrin and also a Kano gubernatorial aspirant of the APC had decamped out of the party, an allegation that was quickly denied by him. Jibrin, who debunked the rumour in a telephone interview, said that he was still in the APC and was not thinking of going out of it anytime soon. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
