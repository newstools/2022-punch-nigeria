There was pandemonium in Igbo-Etche, in the Etche Local Government Area of Rivers State after an unidentified woman allegedly searching for accommodation fled with three siblings. It was gathered that the middle-aged lady visited the compound of the children’s parents to rent a one-bedroom apartment. She was alleged to have lured the children, aged three, six and seven, from their residence in the process of enquiring about the apartment on Thursday. Their mother, who was left distraught by the incident, was said to have raised the alarm when she couldn’t find her children. It was, however, learnt that the incident was reported to the police. Her neighbour, Faith Thompson, told our correspondent that the suspected abductor assisted the mother of the children who was on her way to the market. “The lady in question helped her to carry a charcoal bag. Later she (suspect) returned and told the children that their mother was calling them. Later, she made a call. “I went to the roadside to ask their mother about her children. She said they were at home. I told her they were not at home. I asked her about the lady that was looking for an apartment and whether she was with her but she said no. That was how we started looking for the children,” she explained. When contacted, the acting spokesperson of the state police command, Grace Iringe-Koko, said she had yet to get the report, but promised to find out from the police division and get back to our correspondent. Her response had yet to be sent as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
