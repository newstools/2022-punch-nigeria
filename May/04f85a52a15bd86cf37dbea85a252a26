Singer, Habeeb Okikiola, popularly known as Portable, on Friday, declared himself a “superstar” and also said he is now rich and “expensive”. He added that his music career had opened doors for him and he has now transitioned from days of want to the era of plenty. The PUNCH reports that popular socialite and businessman, Emeka ‘E-Money’ Okonkwo, sponsored Portable to the United Kingdom. After arriving in the UK, Portable took to his Instagram page to share photos and videos of himself and the socialite at the airport. The Zazuu crooner also revealed that he’ll be performing in three cities, while in the UK. While in the UK, the singer knocked his former promoter, Quadri Taoreed, aka Kogbagidi, for his alleged refusal to process a trip for him to the United Kingdom. But in a video on his Instagram page on Friday, Portable who could be seen holding foreign currencies with both hands, said he needed to announce to the world that he now has money. He said the cash in his hand was gotten through legitimate means since he worked for it and he was free to show it off. He said, “Expensive OG. Don’t you know I am expensive? I’m a hero, a superstar. I’m now expensive; expensive than your cars and houses. I now have money and I do music for a living. “It is my money, my legit money so why won’t I show off with it? It is legit money and I’m proud to show it off. I hustle for the money. “When I was poor, I told everyone my situation. Now that I am a superstar with money, I am also back to inform the world that I now have money. I won’t lie, I’m not poor anymore.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
