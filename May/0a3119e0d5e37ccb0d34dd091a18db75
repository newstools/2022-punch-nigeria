Barely a month after a hoodlum was hacked to death by suspected cultists in Abeokuta, Ogun State, another lout, popularly called Wale Matasaka, was shot dead by gunmen suspected to be members of the Aiye cult in the Abeokuta metropolis on Sunday. Our correspondent gathered that the victim, who was suspected to be a member of the Eiye cult, was shot and hacked to death in front of a popular lounge on Quarry Road in the state capital. His death came after 16 persons were killed in cult clashes in the state a month ago. PUNCH Metro also learnt that the latest killing might not be unconnected to last month’s massacre, which took place across the three senatorial districts of the state. A witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Matasaka was trailed by his killers to the popular lounge and shot at repeatedly. The source said, “After the victim fell, the killers went further to hack him before fleeing the scene. “The incident was sudden and fast. It was fun before the killers stormed the place and rained bullets on the victim. “People had to scamper to safety while the deadly attack lasted. When the dust settled, his lifeless body was seen.” A gory picture of the victim’s corpse seen by our correspondent showed machete cuts on both his head and body. The state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Abimbola Oyeyemi, said he could not speak on the incident as of press time.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
