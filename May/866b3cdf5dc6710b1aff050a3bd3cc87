Terrorists who attacked the Abuja-Kaduna train on March 28 have released one of the pregnant women among the abductees. Our correspondent gathered that the pregnant woman was released on compassionate grounds by the terrorist group suspected to be Ansaru Islamic sect, a breakaway of the Boko Haram sect. In a viral video, the pregnant woman, wearing a long black gown and a face mask, called on the Federal Government to negotiate with the terrorists. She said it was necessary because of the uncertainty surrounding the plight of others still languishing in the terrorists’ den. The woman also stated that they were being fed well by the terrorists, adding that the terrorists also took care of their medication. The woman was among the passengers aboard the ill-fated AK9 Abuja-Kaduna train attack by terrorists on March 28, 2022. Another pregnant woman was delivered of a baby girl while in the kidnappers’ den. The released pregnant woman was the third victim of the train attacked freed by the terrorists. The two others are the Managing Director, Bank of Agriculture, Alwan Hassan, who paid N100m ransom; and Sadique,  a son of  the Convener of the Northern Elders Forum, Prof. Ango Abdullahi.
