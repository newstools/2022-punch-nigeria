An Ebute Metta Magistrate’s Court has struck out a case of conspiracy, forgery, and stealing brought against five employees of UACN Property Development Company Plc. The five workers — Cyril Oaku, Ogundipe Victoria, Toyin Marcus, Adekoya Olushola, and Da-Silva Bankole – were arraigned before the court on charges of conspiracy, forgery and stealing in May 2016. The defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges. During the court’s sitting on May 4, 2022, counsel for the first, fourth, and fifth defendants, Tunde Abioye, observed that the prosecution had not shown up to present its case against the defendants. While citing Section 248(1) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, Abioye urged the court to strike out the case for lack of diligent prosecution. The Chief Magistrate A.O. Akandu, in her ruling, agreed with the counsel and dismissed the matter. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
