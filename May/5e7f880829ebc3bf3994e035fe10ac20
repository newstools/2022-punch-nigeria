Israel Adesanya is billed to face middleweight No.1 contender Jared Cannonier on July 2 at UFC 276 at the T-mobile Arena, Las Vegas according to footage from a podcast that showed the background of Dana White’s office. Adesanya defeated Robert Whittaker in February for the second time to retain his middleweight strap, while Cannonier knocked out Derek Brunson in the second round in February to become the weight’s No.1contender. The American recently announced that he had signed the dotted lines for the fight against Adesanya but the date had not been made public. “Contract signed,” Cannonier wrote on his Instagram stories. “Big news on the way.” Adesanya in previous interviews had welcomed the fight against the American. “He’s a beast in the division,” Adesanya had told MMA Fighting. “He’s the dark horse in the division. He’s the guy everyone is sleeping on but you can’t sleep on him because you’ll get put to sleep. I think he’s the guy, the second most dangerous guy in the division behind myself. I look forward to fighting him.” However, footage from a podcast has revealed other potential upcoming UFC fights with fans excited to see a fight between Khamzat Chimaev and Nate Diaz also fixed for July 2. Chimaev is one of the most ferocious up-and-coming stars and recently edged a decision against Gilbert Burns. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
