The Chairman, 2022 Peoples Democratic Party National Convention Organising Committee, Senator David Mark, has described the rising insecurity, unemployment, corruption and poverty in the country as the hallmark of the All Progressives Congress’ administration led by the president, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). According to him, the present regime has made living in the country worthless. Mark stated this while giving his welcome address during the PDP’S primary election in Abuja on Saturday. He said, “Fellow countrymen and women are today in captivity with kidnappers and our government looking overwhelmed and unable to rescue them. Sadly, the APC government has mortgaged the future of Nigerians with borrowings with nothing tangible to show. Nigeria is now the poverty capital of the world. “The intractable insecurity situation, rising unemployment, poverty, ineptitude and corruption and above all the poor management of our diversity have become the hallmark of the APC administration. They have made living in Nigeria worthless.” Mark also lampooned the government for the protracted ASUU strike, adding that the strike was as a result of the failure of the current administration to address the issues bedevilling the education sector. He enjoined the aspirants to approach the exercise with the spirit of sportsmanship. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
