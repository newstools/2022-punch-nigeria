A Federal High Court sitting in Osogbo has fixed Wednesday, May 18 for ruling on the validity of March 8 governorship primary of the Peoples Democratic Party in Osun State. Justice Nathaniel Ayo-Emmanuel, after listening to submissions of counsel for parties in the matter on Monday, subsequently adjourned for ruling. The plaintiff, Prince Dotun Babayemi, in a suit with No FHC/OS/CyS/26/2022, had dragged the Independent National Electoral Commission, PDP and Senator Ademola Adeleke before the court, asking it to declare as invalid the governorship primary that produced the ex Federal lawmaker. Addressing the court, counsel for the plaintiff, Yusuf Ali(SAN), said the primaries held at Osogbo City Stadium was organised contrary to the decision of the court. He urged the court to dismiss the primary as it was an illegal exercise. But in a counter argument, counsel for the PDP, Mr M. Atolagbe, told the court that the plaintiff did not participate in the primary election conducted by the party’s National Working Committee. He declared the matter as an abuse of court since the plaintiff was not part of the process. He added that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain such a matter as a similar case was pending before an appellate court. Towing the same line of argument, Mr Wole Jimi-Bada, who represented Adeleke, told the court to dismiss the suit for lacking in merit. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
