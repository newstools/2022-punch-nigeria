The Director-General of the Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s Support Groups Management Council, Abdulmumin Jibrin, has announced his decision to leave the All Progressives Congress. Jibrin, a staunch Tinubu campaigner, disclosed this in a terse post on his official social media platforms on Saturday. He posted: “I have done my best for the APC. It’s time to move on. “I will announce my new political party within the next 24 hours Insha Allah. I will make a formal statement in due course.” The former lawmaker, who represented Kiru/Bebeji Federal Constituency of Kano State in the House of Representatives from June 2011 to June 2015, had earlier been a strong voice in promoting the presidential ambition of the former governor of Lagos State. He had appeared on television on occasions to sell Tinubu’s ambition to Nigerians ahead of the APC primary election. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
