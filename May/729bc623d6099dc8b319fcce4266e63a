Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has stated that the All Progressive Congress does not have the capacity to unify the country, adding that APC’s years of misrule have further divided the country. The presidential aspirant made this know in Minna on Thursday when he met with Niger State delegates of the Peoples Democratic Party seeking their votes in the forthcoming party’s primary. He stated that the APC does not have the capacity to bring Nigeria out of the quagmire it has thrown it into nor does it have the capacity to provide employment and skills for women and youth. “Therefore I appeal to you not to vote for APC in the general elections, they don’t have the capacity to unify this country nor can they provide empowerment for women and youth”. The presidential aspirant added that the PDP is left with no option but to ensure that they wrestle power from APC to avert and correct the mistakes of the ruling party’s misrule. “You see what the APC did you in your state, what did they bring to you other than banditry and hardship. Everything you have in Niger today was as a result of the efforts from the PDP administration therefore you cannot afford to allow them again”. Atiku also appealed to members of the party to be united adding that the unity of the party will be the determining factor for winning the state governorship election in 2023. In his remarks, the PDP Chairman in Niger, Tanko Beji, urged the delegates to do the right thing during the party’s primary. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
