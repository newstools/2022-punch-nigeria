A Kano State governorship aspirant of the People’s Democratic Party, Muhyi Rimingado, has called on Nigerians to be more vigilant in their environments. Rimingado made the appeal while commiserating with the people of the state and Sabongari area in particular over Tuesday’s explosion that rocked the ancient city of Kano. In a statement by his media office, the governorship aspirant urged Kano residents to be more security conscious and vigilant in their daily activities. Rimingado noted that the strategic importance of Kano in the affairs of Nigeria cannot be overemphasised due to the configuration of ethnic nationalities residing in the state. He, therefore, urged residents to intensify prayers for sustainable peace to reign “in our dear state as we approach the general election”. The PDP chieftain said an explosion of such magnitude calls for sober reflection so that “our common humanity will continue to unite us as we put hands on deck to take Kano to greater heights”. He further appealed to all and sundry to desist from rumour mongering over the cause of the explosion as to whether it was a gas or bomb effect. The aspirant also called on relevant government agencies to adopt proactive measures at curbing such incidents. He also condoled the people who lost their loved ones during the sad incident and prayed to Allah to prevent future occurrence in any part of the country. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
