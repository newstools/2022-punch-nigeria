Led in evidence before the court, Sade confessed to have committed the offence. To prove the case against Sade, Police prosecutor, Samson Osobu, called three witnesses and tendered three exhibits including N100,000 cash recovered from the convict. Sade’s counsel, Yinka Opaleke, did not call any witness, but pleaded with the court to temper justice with mercy. Delivering judgment, Justice Lekan Ogunmoye said there was prescribed mandatory sentence for the offence and the court had no discretionary power to exercise in the matter. “The defendant is hereby sentenced to seven years imprisonment in count one (Fraud) and five years imprisonment in count two (Stealing) with N20,000 option of fine. “The sentences are to run concurrently,’’ Justice Ogunmoye said.
