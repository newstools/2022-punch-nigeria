Another female aspirant, Dr Caro Nwosu, has formally declared her ambition to join the 2023 presidential race under the African Action Congress. Nwosu, who is the president of the Voice for Senior Citizens of Nigeria group, made the declaration at the Symposium Hall of the Nigerian National Merit Award House in Abuja on Thursday. In her declaration, Nwosu noted that her government would give unalloyed support to the oneness and unity of Nigeria and therefore committed to building a united, peaceful and harmonious nation with the ability to accommodate and cater for all her citizens and very strong enough to be the world black and African superpower. Nwosu said that she will tackle the country’s challenges that have bedevilled the nation’s quest for a strong and stable federation and unlock the country’s potential. “I will put serious checks and balances in place to promote accountability, entrench the rule of law, nurture political parties to grow, promote transparent and credible elections, and growth in democracy,” she stated. She also pledged to give appointments to 35 per cent of Nigerian women through the act of parliament and also to youths and people living with disability in government. Okunnu-Lamidi was the first female to declare her interest in running for the office of Nigeria’s number one seat in early January in Lagos. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
