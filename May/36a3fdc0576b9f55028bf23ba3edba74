Justin Dean, a sports therapist and the estranged husband of dancer and singer, Korra Obidi, have continued to trade tackles with each other on social media over $5,000 which Obidi claimed Dean withdrew from their joint account without her permission. Taking to her Facebook page, Obidi claimed that Dean withdrew the money she deposited into the joint account they both used to manage. She said, “He has stolen from me and my girls. I don’t want to be treated like a horse that is working for a slave master. I sent this money by mistake to the joint account. He has emptied the account. He is stealing from me. “He is not giving me any money for food, for the girls; nothing. I am taking care of these girls myself and he is stealing from us.” Obidi also stated that when she reached out to him to pay back the money, he refused. However, reacting to the allegations, Dean said, “(Yes), I transferred money. It was an accident. I was not expecting anyone to transfer any money to the joint account or any account. I was paying bills. I am a busy person. I returned the money; it was a bonafide accident.” Meanwhile, Obidi also returned to her social media pages to insist that Dean actually took the money. In a video posted on Instagram, she claimed that the doctor was not being truthful. Highlighting the e-mail conversation she had with Dean where he acknowledged transferring the funds and asked Obidi to also refund some money she took from him, she said, “You stole $4900 from the joint account. Send my money back. We are separated and it is a theft.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
