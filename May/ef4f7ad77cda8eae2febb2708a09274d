Super Eagles forward, Cyriel Dessers, has raised doubts over his future at Feyenoord, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Dessers, who joined the Dutch side from Belgian outfit Genk on a season loan, is yet to reach an agreement with the club despite being available to join them permanently for €4m. The Rotterdam club has until June 1 to exercise this option. Speaking ahead of Wednesday’s Europa Conference League final at the Arena Kombetare in Tirana, Albania, Dessers said, “I really don’t know,” the 27-year-old said when asked about his future at club. “I don’t want my manager to talk to me about it. After the final against AS Roma, we will sit down to eat and something should come out of it. “I don’t feel like this will be my last game. I have often said that I am very happy at Feyenoord. On the other hand, I am 27 years old and this may be the opportunity to really take a step abroad. “But Feyenoord is a special club and the grass is not always greener elsewhere.” The Nigeria international has impressed this season, particularly in the Europa Conference League, where he is the tournament’s top scorer with 10 goals. In all competitions, the 27-year-old has scored 21 times in 46 games. Meanwhile, Feyenoord coach Arne Slot and technical director Frank Arnesen are unsure whether the club will be able to meet Dessers’ demands, according to a report on Dutch website sudinfo.be.
