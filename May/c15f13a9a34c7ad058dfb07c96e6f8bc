Following speculations that she has withdrawn from the presidential race, the only female aspirant under the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Uju Ohanenye, said she remains in the race. Ohanenye stated that she is in the contest to win, adding that she would give the race her best. The presidential hopeful spoke in Abuja on Wednesday after a socio-cultural group, Nzuko Umuada Anambra Advancement International Initiative presented her with an award. She noted that Nigeria needs domestic interventions to overcome challenges bedevilling the country. Ohanenye said, “We have few women in the contest. I am talking to them to come out. Let’s summon the courage. I don’t know whether, are we afraid of you men? Or are we afraid of the world? “Because so many women are well to do, they work hard. I am telling them to come out. You know before now, we decided to relax thinking that the men will give us the best because we are all brought up to be loyal to our husbands, to be under a man, but as things are going right now, our children are suffering everywhere and I don’t see it as the people that have ruled are not doing their best but a woman’s input is very much needed. “Nigeria needs domestic interventions to overcome the various challenges we are facing which only women can give. I am giving this contest all that I have got. It is a lie I have stepped down. I am not thinking of that.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
