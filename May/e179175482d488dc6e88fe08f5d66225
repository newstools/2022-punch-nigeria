A veterinarian, Dr Bukola Oyebanji, has said Nigeria can meet its daily dairy needs in the next five years from local production if structures that will support and improve the dairy business can be provided. Oyebanji disclosed this at the opening session of a training workshop for selected academics and dairy business owners sponsored by Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife; Federal College of Animal Health and Reproductive Technology; and Van Hall University of Applied Sciences, Netherlands, held in OAU, Ile-Ife, Osun State. According to her, all stakeholders must demonstrate the will to ensure that the country achieved sufficiency in milk production by paying attention to all key areas from the production of raw milk to value addition. She said, “It is about the will to succeed. I am expecting that in the next five years, we should be able to meet our daily dairy needs from local production. By the time we get the breed that can give us enough milk, we can also do cross-breeding or selection for our breed. In the next five years, Nigeria can attain self-sufficiency in milk production. It is just the will to do it that we need. “We want to see improvement in production. I am talking about production from the animals. During a recent visit to farm, we discovered that animals are still given two litres of milk per day and if you look at developed countries, you see animals give 25 litres of milk in a day. ” Copyright PUNCH.
