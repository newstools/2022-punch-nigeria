The National Leader of All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, has advanced reasons why the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and his Deputy, Obafemi Hamzat, deserved to continue in office beyond 2023. Tinubu said the duo has built an unbreakable team to raise the bar of excellence in governance and service delivery in the state, with visible achievements and progress to show for their efforts. The presidential aspirant said this at the party’s stakeholders’ meeting held at Adeyemi Bero Auditorium in Alausa on Friday, where physically raised the hands of Sanwo-Olu and Hamzat, in approval of their second term bid The formed unbreakable team, the APC National leader said, earned the governor and his deputy the opportunity to return for a second term, and not a blank endorsement that many politicians sought. Tinubu, a leading presidential hopeful on the APC platform, said Lagos under Sanwo-Olu’s leadership had remained a state of pride for residents and other Nigerians who crave responsive governance and progress. He said: “We have a brilliant Governor at the helm of affairs, who is supported by his deputy to build an unbreakable team that has raised the bar of excellence in governance in Lagos. I especially thank Dr. Hamzat, who has been a very good assistant and a pillar of support to the Governor. “Sanwo-Olu with Hamzat has raised an impenetrable team. I commend both of you and all members of the cabinet. You have all done wonderfully well and I must say that I am very proud of you.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
