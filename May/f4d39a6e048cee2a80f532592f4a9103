TikTok is testing games for the app in Vietnam ahead of a major push into the space according to Reuters. A company representative confirmed tests of HTML5 mini-games, saying, “We’re always looking at ways to enrich our platform and regularly test new features and integrations that bring value to our community.” The outlet’s sources indicate the plan is for ad-supported games that draw from the library of its parent company, ByteDance, which could boost revenue and increase the amount of time people spend on the TikTok app — if that’s even possible. TikTok has already tried at least one in-app mini-game, as it teamed up with Feeding America to make Garden of Good, a FarmVille-like experience where players could earn points and use them to make a donation. It also announced a partnership with FarmVille developer Zynga late last year to make Disco Loco 3D, an HTML5-based endless runner that could work inside the app, but new reports suggest that’s just the start for TikTok’s gaming ambitions.
