Supporters of aspirants for various positions in the primary elections of the All Progressives Congress in Osun state have been congratulating them (aspirants) on their victories in the exercise, even though official results of the primary were yet to be released. The state had opted for direct primary which enabled all party members holding valid membership cards to vote for the aspirants of their choice at each ward’s collation centre of the 332 wards in the state. As of Saturday evening, official results of the State Assembly primary held on Thursday were yet to be released. Also, results of the House of Representatives primary held on Friday were still being expected even as elections to pick senatorial candidates were being held. Non-release of the results has not,however, deterred supporters from congratulating the aspirants. Several conflicting results were also circulated across social media platforms awarding victories to different aspirants. Secretary of a Congress Committee set up by APC in the state to assist groups sent by the national secretariat of the party to conduct the primary, Mr. Sunday Akere, when speaking with our correspondent on the development said, “The results are coming in. The Committee in charge of the State Assembly primary will announce the results in full. “The Committee in charge of the House of Representatives will also announce the results. The national returning committee will make necessary announcements.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
