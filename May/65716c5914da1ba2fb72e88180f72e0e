The Vice Chancellor of Abia State University, Uturu, Professor Onyemachi Ogbulu, has commended the Governor and Visitor to the university, Okezie Ikpeazu, for his intervention and support towards solving the security challenges experienced for a while along the Okigwe-Uturu road and environs. Addressing the newly sworn-in executives of the university’s Student Union Government and Student Representative Council when they paid him a courtesy visit, the Vice Chancellor assured that the university management, with the support of the state government and relevant security agencies, are working relentlessly to bring the security situation in the area under permanent control. Ogbulu explained that the university management considered the safety of students in giving directive for them to proceed on a mid-term break, while more security solutions are being worked out. He also commended the university’s electoral body for conducting free and fair elections that produced the new SUG executives, “…in keeping with the tradition of transparency and non interference in election processes established by the founding fathers of the University”, stressing that the management of the school under his watch, is not clannish or ethnocentric, “rather will work in synergy with the new executives for the overall development of the University.” In their separate speeches, the SUG President, Comrade Ibeneme Chidera, and Speaker of the SRC, Rt. Hon. Ihemadu Evans, pledged their cooperation to the school management to work for the interest and welfare of students, while the Deputy Speaker, Rt.Hon. Glory Arisa, in her vote of thanks described the Vice Chancellor as “a man of goodwill.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
