…Senator Abe’s supporter okays process The All Progressives Congress in Rivers State said about 89 aspirants for the State House of Assembly were screened, describing the process as peaceful. The party screened 61 aspirants on Wednesday and concluded the exercise on Thursday after it screened 28 more state legislature aspirants. A member of the Congress and screening committee from Abuja, Prince Michael, confirmed this to our correspondent on telephone, saying all camps were accommodated. Michael stated, “Some persons came back today. So, all together they are 89 screened. “They were supposed to come yesterday (Wednesday), but even before I arrived Port Harcourt, most of them were calling me, even threatening me with text messages. “Because of what happened yesterday, the chairman didn’t have access to the secretariat initially. “But they came today and they were screened. Everything went smoothly. They were even interacting with the chairman of our committee.” One of the aspirants and supporter of Senator Magnus Abe, Innocent Ajelo, said the screening was transparent. “They gave everybody free chance to submit their documents. Initially we were scared because anybody can come from anywhere and claim that the party sent them. “But having come here today, they showed us evidence that they are from the national secretariat and we submitted ourselves for screening. I score them 80 percent. “We are only being careful of not being in the wrong hands,” he stated. Asked how many aspirants from the Senator Abe camp were screened, he said “We have only one APC in Rivers State.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
