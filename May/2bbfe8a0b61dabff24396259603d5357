A gospel singer, Doris Aigbadumah, has said she often gets inspiration for her songs while she is deep in worship and meditation. She told Sunday Scoop, “My inspiration comes from the place of meditation and worship. Most times, it could just be three lines of lyrics (that would come to me). l would then build the rest of the song.” Asked what informed her decision to do gospel music, she said, “l started singing from a very young age. I knew I had a special gift for me because while in college, I was called ‘the girl with a golden voice’. After my college education, I decided to do something else with my time, and attending a music school was the first thought that came to my mind.” Aigbadumah also noted that so far, the acceptance of her music has been encouraging. Though some people feel that gospel musicians should not sing praises of people at ceremonies or parties, she said, “l do not share that thought because gospel music falls into different categories. We have ministers of the gospel, entertainers of the gospel, and inspirational singers. A minister of the gospel would not sing the praises of any man but an entertainer of the gospel can sing the praises of man. It all depends on the category the artiste fits in.” Reeling out expectations from her music career, she said, “In years to come, I desire to own a music firm where I would have uninterrupted access to do live recordings. I will also like to organise a gospel music competition, to discover new talented artistes.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
