American doctor, Justin Dean, has denied claims that he stole money from his estranged wife and popular Nigerian dancer, Korra Obidi. The PUNCH had reported that Obidi cried out in a Facebook live video on Saturday, alleging that her husband stole a sum of $5,000 from her. The mother of two said she had mistakenly sent the sum to her PayPal account, which was connected to the couple’s joint account. “Justin went into the joint account, I had mistakenly sent $5,000 there for rent and a bunch of other stuff. I sent it to my PayPal; I didn’t know the account linked to the PayPal was still a joint account. He emptied the account,” she claimed. Responding to the allegations hours later, the chiropractor said the withdrawal from the joint account was a “bona fide mistake”. “I transferred money,” he admitted. “It was an accident. I was not expecting anyone to transfer any money to the joint account or any account. I was paying bills. I’m a busy person. I returned the money, it was an accident, a bona fide accident.” “$27,445, that’s what I make as a $300 an hour clinician. An elite clinician, one of the top paid clinicians in the country,” he boasted. He also stated that he had transferred funds from the joint account thinking it was his savings account. Dean announced he was divorcing his wife in March, shortly after they welcomed their second child. According to him, the marriage was detrimental to his mental health, and the safety of his children.
