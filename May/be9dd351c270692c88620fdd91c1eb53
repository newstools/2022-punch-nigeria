THE Lagos State Police Command has commenced investigation to unravel the circumstances surrounding the death of two lovers, whose corpses were found inside a Sport Utility Vehicle in the Isolo area of the state. The PUNCH gathered that the corpses of a man, identified simply as Koyejo, and that of his yet-to-be-identified lover, were recovered inside the vehicle which was parked around Double Star Junction, in the Jakande Estate area of Isolo, on Sunday. The corpses of the lovers were said to have been discovered when people in the area observed that the engine of Koyejo’s SUV, which was parked on the premises since Saturday, was still running at the same spot on Sunday. In a bid to ascertain what was going on, some of the concerned people moved closer to the vehicle and as they peeped through the window, they reportedly saw the lifeless remains of the lovers inside the vehicle. The residents were said to have raised an alarm and reported the incident to the police station. Contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin, who confirmed the incident, said the command had “commenced investigation.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
