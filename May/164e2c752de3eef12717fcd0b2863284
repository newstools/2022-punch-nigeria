Internationally-recognised Nigerian singers, Davido and Burna Boy, are both set to release songs from their respective next albums on the same day, May 13, 2022. Born Damini Ogulu, Burna Boy announced that his new song, “Last Last”, off his next album, Love, Damini, will be released on May 13. The Ye crooner tweeted late Tuesday, “Finally, breakfast will be served midnight 13/05 WAT #lovedamini”, as he shared an image with the words, “Last Last”. His announcement came a few hours after Davido announced his first song, “Stand Strong”, off his next album. Speaking of the song on his Instagram page on Tuesday, the award-winning singer noted that the song will be something different from the usual. He noted that Stand Strong talks about the other part of his world “where every day is a battle.” Davido wrote, “For the first time, I want to bring you into the other part of my world. The part where every day is a battle but I have no option but to STAND STRONG. I present to you, the first single off my next album.” He also shared a snippet of the song which featured Kanye West’s Sunday Service choir, The Samples. At the end of the snippet, Davido announced that the song will be released on May 13. Following their announcements, fans have built expectations toward the release of the songs on Friday.
