A budding afro-pop singer, Oluwaseyifunmi Michael, aka Sey Byth, has described investment in the music business as both huge and risky. He said, “The funds expended on music projects cost millions of naira with no guarantee that there would be return on investment. It is only someone who has a lot of money to spare that will invest in such a business because the funds can easily go down the drain. So, any youth that struggles to produce good music without any support should be encouraged,” The singer also threw a jab at the Federal Government for pointing accusing fingers at the Nigerian youth for the incessant killings and kidnapping in the country. He said, “Is the government clean? Now that elections are coming, politicians are ready to do anything to attain power. However, I give kudos to all musicians. It takes a lot of stress to make a song from the scratch. “The government should not frustrate the energy and talents of the youth because we are adding great value to the country. They should create good platforms and opportunities for the youth to thrive.” The singer also stated that he is happy that his new song, Oluwa, is being well received by fans. Copyright PUNCH.
