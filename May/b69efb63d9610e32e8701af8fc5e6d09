Nollywood actor and comedian, Ayo Makun, popularly known as AY, has stated that one’s true character can be judged by the way he treats his fellow men. The filmmaker made this known in a tweet on Thursday, where he mentioned that they was always a story behind every person’s action or reaction. This comes shortly after the actor exposed the reasons behind his alleged beef with fellow comedian, Bright Okpocha, popularly known as Basketmouth. According to AY, Basketmouth had “uncontrollable superiority complex” which he (AY) had to avoid. In his latest tweet, however, the father-of-two noted that it was always easier to condemn “the one who can’t take it anymore” based on his approach to situations. AY’s tweet read, “There is always a story behind every action or reaction. It is easier to always condemn the one who can’t take it anymore based on his approach to unbearable situations. “But we can ONLY judge the true character of a person by the way he treats his fellow men.” In Ay’s earlier revelation, he described Basketmouth’s attitude as an “incessant childishness” he had to avoid for his sanity sake. Basketmouth, however, had not reacted to AY’s disclosure at the time of writing this report. In August last year, Basketmouth had also spoken about his beef with AY Makun, as he stated that the latter “messed around with loyalty.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
