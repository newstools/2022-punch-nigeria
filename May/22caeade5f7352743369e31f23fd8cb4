Operatives of the Ekiti State Police Command have arrested two suspected cattle rustlers troubling herders in the forests in the Ikole-Ekiti area. The police said the two suspects were arrested for the rustling of a N500, 000 cow, which they sold to a receiver, who had, in turn, butchered the cow. Police Public Relations Officer for the Command, Sunday Abutu, disclosed how the suspected rustlers were nabbed in a statement titled, “Ekiti State Police Command arrests suspected cattle rustlers” made available in Ado Ekiti on Tuesday. Abutu said, “On April 30, 2022 at about 2.30 pm, the command received a distress call that a group of cattle rustlers came to Ikole Ekiti forest, attacked some herdsmen with dangerous weapons, and forcibly went away with a cow valued at N500,000. “Upon the receipt of the information, the command mobilised a team of Rapid Response Squad to the scene where one Mohammed Mohammed (22years old) and Yahu Bello (42years old) were arrested. “During interrogation, the suspected cattle rustlers confessed to the commission of the crime and led operatives to the house of the receiver of the rustled cow. The cow has been dismembered, but the receiver, unfortunately, escaped arrest.” “While a serious manhunt has been launched on the fleeing receiver, the arrested suspects will be charged to court subsequently for prosecution,” the PPRO said.
