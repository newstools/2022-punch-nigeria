The Vice-Chancellor, Prince Abubakar Audu University, Anyigba in Kogi state, Prof. Marietu Tenuche has warned staff and students of the institution against cultism, rape, and extortion. The Vice-Chancellor handed down the warning in a speech delivered at the matriculation of 6,470 new students and made available to newsmen in Lokoja on Monday. “This institution has zero-tolerance for social vices like cultism, rape, extortion, and others and will not spear anyone caught”. She told the matriculating students unequivocally to as a matter of their own interest keep off from outlawed social vices in the institution which may bring to ridicule the name of the university, state, and their parents. “Cultism, rape, extortion, of money from students using class representatives, indecent dressing, among others, are vices that have no place in the new university that we are building. As an administration, we have zero tolerance for these vices”, she said. She also disclosed that the National universities Commission had given full accreditation to the nine programmes of the  Faculty of Education. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
