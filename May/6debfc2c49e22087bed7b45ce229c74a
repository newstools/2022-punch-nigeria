A former Chairman, Adamawa United, Emmanuel Zira, has called on the League Management Company to put the 2021/22 Nigeria Professional Football League season on hold, The PUNCH reports. Zira’s statement came on the heel of violence at different match venues in the league, with the latest in Ilorin and Lagos. The game between Kwara United and Rivers United was marred by off-pitch incidents in Ilorin while the game involving MFM FC and Enugu Rangers saw the match official being manhandled by a fan in Lagos. The match-day 24 incidents were not the first unpleasant incident to have happened this season. On match-day 19 of the 2021/22 NPFL season, fans of Wikki Tourists attacked players and officials of visiting Enyimba in Bauchi, inflicting varying degrees of injuries on their captain Austin Oladapo, Cyril Olisema, and some officials after the tie ended 0-0. Despite several fines and bans by the LMC on clubs to curb the menace, violence continues to rock various match venues across the country. Zita suggested that the season be put on hold to allow the league governing body to look for a solution to the violent acts. “What is the match commissioner’s report saying about this controversial reportage? I hear Lagos too was on fire,” Zira said. “I think the league needs to take a break and convene an urgent meeting to thoroughly discuss these issues and arrest these incidences before they get out of control. “A stitch in time saves nine.”  Copyright PUNCH.
