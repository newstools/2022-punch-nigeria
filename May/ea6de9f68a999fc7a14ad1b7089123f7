A 57-year-old man, Izete Jeremiah, who was allegedly shot by a herdsman, has appealed to the Edo State Government and well-meaning individuals to come to his aid to enable him to undergo surgery and lead a normal life. Jeremiah was allegedly shot on April 7 at Odiguetue community in the Ovia North-East Local Government Area of the state. He was reportedly shot in the mouth during an attack by suspected herdsmen who invaded some farms. The victim, who is currently battling for his life at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, said he had spent all his savings and now relies on relatives of other patients to access treatment and get drugs. During a visit to the UBTH where he is currently receiving treatment, it was observed that Izete could neither speak nor eat except through a feeding tube passed through his nose. His wife, Mabel, told journalists, “My husband has been at the hospital since April 7. My husband can’t speak or eat, except through the nose with the aid of the tube. We have spent our savings and even borrowed. We don’t have money now; even the drugs they gave us were bought by relatives of patients through contributions. “We have spent over N500,000, excluding hospital bills. Now, he has to undergo surgery on the damaged jaw so that he can eat and talk. He needs over N800,000 for the surgery. The artificial jaw plate costs about N500,000. They haven’t told us the cost of the surgery, and we still have hospital bills to pay. “We need help from well-meaning individuals to be able to carry out the surgery. I am also calling on Governor Godwin Obaseki to come to our aid so that my husband can get well and take care of his family. Things have been difficult for us.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
