A televangelist and founder of the Solid Rock Kingdom Church, Apostle John Okoriko, who recently regained freedom after being kidnapped by suspected gunmen in Akwa Ibom State, has said two of his abductors knelt before him and demanded prayers and forgiveness before he was released from their custody. The cleric was abducted on the premises of his church in Mkpat Enin Local Government Area of the state and released after four days in captivity. Okoriko, who spoke while narrating his ordeal in the hands of his abductors on Sunday, said the kidnappers tortured him so he could accept to pay the N100m ransom demanded by them. He said, “The torture was much. They did terrible things to my body to force me to bring money to them. I told them that I had not seen such money in my entire life. They told me I am ‘Adeboye’ the richest pastor close to them in Akwa Ibom State. “Out of the five-man gang that abducted me, two of them knelt and asked me to pray for them before they released me in the evening and I prayed for those that needed my prayers.” Copyright PUNCH.
