One person was burnt to death on Friday as a vehicle went up in flames around the Long Bridge axis of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. Our correspondent who was at the accident scene observed that the vehicle veered off the road and plunged beneath the bridge. Officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps who were among the first responders at the scene told The PUNCH that rescue operations were ongoing. It was also gathered that some occupants of the charred vehicle were evacuated to a nearby hospital. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
