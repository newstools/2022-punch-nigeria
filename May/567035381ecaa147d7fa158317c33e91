Three royal fathers and residents of communities in Ayedaade Local Government Areas of Osun state on Monday, commended Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, for keeping promises made to the electorate. They also assured him that his re-election would be supported. Oyetola continued his re-election campaign in Ode-Omu, Orile-Owu, and Gbongan following the flag off in Ife last Thursday. A statement by Ismail Omipidan, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, titled: ‘2022: Olufi, Alayegun, Olowu, throw weight behind Oyetola’s re-election,’ said Olufi of Gbongan, Oba Adetoyese Oyeniyi, commended the governor for his impressive record in less than four years. Oba Oyeniyi said Governor Oyetola needed to return to consolidate on the good works he had done since assuming office in November 2018. Speaking in a similar vein, the Alayegun of Ode Omu, Oba James Bolanrinwa Alabi Oladipupo, described Governor Oyetola as fulfilling God’s promise, adding that his performance in three-and-a-half years showed that he was raised to fix Osun. He said, “God made a promise to Osun and fulfilled it with the emergence of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola. Those who are observant will know that there have been tremendous and significant changes in Osun since he became governor. He will do even better if trusted with the mandate again. “I appeal to you all not to work against the fulfilment of God’s promise. Rather, let us join hands with the man who has been ordained for this great task. I believe that come July 16, he will emerge victoriously.” In Orile-Owu, the Olowu of Orile-Owu, Oba Daud Akinfalabi, also pledged the readiness of the Owu community to support Oyetola’s re-election on the strength of his performance.
