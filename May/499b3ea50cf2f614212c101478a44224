The Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Abeokuta, Peter Odetoyinbo, has cautioned governments against regulating social media. The bishop also advised media organisations and practitioners to be careful of the content they are releasing out to the public. Odetoyinbo  spoke at an event marking the World Communications Day,  with the theme ‘Listening with the ear of the heart,’ held at St. Peter and Paul Cathedral, Adatan, Abeokuta, Ogun State. The bishop, who spoke with newsmen, shortly after he inaugurated the Catholic Media Practitioners Association of Nigeria, said social media should be left open as it is, and allow people take responsibility of what they post. When asked on whether government should regulate social media or not , Odetoyinbo said “why  should government regulate it? We must ask. It’s the government that can tell why it should regulate it. “It is government that can answer why it should be regulated, because, it is open to everyone. As long as everybody takes responsibility in freedom for what is being communicated, I think the network will provide good things for the world.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
