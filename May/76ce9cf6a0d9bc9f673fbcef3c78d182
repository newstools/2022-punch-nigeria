The All Progressive Grand Alliance has approved the postponement of its House of Representatives primaries by one day, according to a statement obtained on Saturday and signed by its National Organising Secretary, Ifeanyi Mbaeri. The party said the shift was to avoid a clash with the date of the court trial of the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, and the attendant sit-at-home order usually issued by the IPOB in most parts of the South East. According to Mberi, the special national convention for nomination of presidential candidate of APGA would now hold on June 1, 2022. He said, “Due to the ongoing court trial of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu which has been adjourned to May 26, 2022 and the resultant sit-at-home in the South-East, it has become imperative for the party to reschedule its House of Representatives primaries earlier scheduled for the same May 26, 2022 “Consequently, the House of Representatives Primary Election of APGA will hold nationwide on May 27, 2022.” Mbaeri said the party had duly notified the Independent National Electoral Commission of the adjustment in dates. The party, however, said other primary elections of APGA would hold as originally scheduled. “For clarity, the dates for APGA primaries are as follows: State House of Assembly: May 24, 2022; House of Representatives: May 27, 2022; Senate: May 28, 2022.” The statement added that the party’s governorship primary slated for May 29,  2022 would still hold as scheduled.
