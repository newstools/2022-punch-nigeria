The Osun State Commissioner of Police, Wale Olokode, has warned youths in Ede, and the rest of the state against joining cult groups. Also, Timi of Ede, Oba Adesola Lawal, has pledged support for the campaign to end cultism and other vices across his domain. Speaking in Ede during the launch of Police Campaign Against Cultism and Other Vices in Ede North and South, Olokode blamed bad parenting for some of the vices being exhibited by the youths. He also identified the influence of peer groups, economic hardship, and incessant strikes, among other reasons for youths’ involvement in cult activities. According to him, the campaign was aimed at tackling the menace of cultism, and warning youths in Ede, and Osun in general, to steer clear of cultism and other vices. Oba Lawal, in his remarks, appealed to students to shun cultism and other vices, and “promise to support the crusade to reduce the rate of crimes and criminalities among the youths.” Copyright PUNCH.
