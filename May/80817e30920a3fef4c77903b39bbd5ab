It was another black Sunday in Anambra State, following the killing of seven persons in various communities across the state by gunmen. Gunmen were said to have invaded Isulo and Nanka, Orumba North Local Government Area, as well as Abatete in Idemili North LGA. It was gathered that the attack at Isulo left four siblings dead with their mother. Two persons were killed at Abatete while another person was killed at Nanka Orumba North LGA. Eyewitnesses said the gunmen stormed those areas and opened fire on the victims and left. When contacted, the state police spokesman, Tochukwu Ikenga, said the details of the incidents were still sketchy. Ikenga added that the command would talk about the incidents on Monday when they must have gotten a clear picture of what transpired. However, one of the senior police officers who did not want to be quoted confirmed the Isulo incident. He said that the woman and her children did not look like people from Igboland. But he failed to confirm the other two locations, saying, “I have not received the signals of those ones.” Tension had already heightened in the state following the constant attacks of the gunmen in recent times.
