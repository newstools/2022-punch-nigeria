Joseph Ameh, ex-husband of popular dancer, Kafayat ‘Kaffy’ Shafau, has broken silence concerning the annulment of his marriage. In a statement on Sunday, the father-of-two refuted claims from his wife that he slept with her best friend. He added that he made a “lot of silly mistake” in the marriage and have decided to move on. The statement addressed to his wife read, “I will make this as brief as possible. I made a lot of silly mistakes in my life and in my marriage. “I take full responsibility of all my foolishness with absolutely no excuses. “However, I never slept wit your best friend or close pals- neither have I ever been violent towards you,contrary to the narratives flying around about me. “Anyway, It has been a year since the marriage officially ended. I’ve tried to move on and I do advise you do the same too. “I wish all the very best to both of us as we move on maturely. The end of our marriage should not be the end of our lives. “This is the first and last time I will speak on this subject.” Kaffy had caused a stir on the Internet when she opened up about her divorce in January 2022. The dancer, who noted that she was celibate for three years before her divorce, had hinted that her husband slept with her best friend in a recent interview. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
