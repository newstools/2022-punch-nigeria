Almeria will be banking on their most in-form striker Sadiq Umar in their quest to gain promotion to the Spanish topflight as they take on Real Sociedad B on Friday (today), PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The game has all the makings of a thrilling contest as both sides head into the clash on a three-match winning streak. Almeria made it three straight wins last time out as they edged out Amorebieta 3-0 on home turf with Umar scoring his side’s third goal in the 89th minute to seal all three points. They are now unbeaten in each of their last six outings, claiming four wins and two draws in that time. With three games to go, Almeria are currently top of the league standings with a two-point cushion over second-place Eibar. The Nigeria international has been instrumental to Almeria this season and has contributed 28 goals (17 goals and 11 assists) in 33 games. The victory over Amorebieta saw the Rojiblancos move to top of the league with 76 points from 39 games. A win today could see Almeria secure promotion and play in the La Liga Dision for the 2022/22 season. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
