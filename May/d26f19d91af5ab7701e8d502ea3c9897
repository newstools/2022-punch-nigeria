The Anambra State Governor, Chukwuma Soludo, has told the people of the state not to panic over gunmen’s threat to attack local government areas in the state. Soludo described the “anonymous” letter as a tool intended to create tension and fear among the peace loving people of the state. In a statement on Wednesday signed by the Chief Press Secretary, Mr Christian Aburime, the governor assured the people of the state and residents of adequate safety and protection as security agencies are jointly working round the clock with the state government to maintain law and order. The statement, titled, ‘Re: Threat of attack on 10 LGAs in Anambra State’, urged the people to go about their lawful businesses without any fear or molestation. It read in part, “The attention of the Government of Anambra State has been drawn to an anonymous threat letter being circulated in the state of a planned attack on 10 local government areas in the state. “According to the said letter, the listed local government areas include; Ihiala, Aguata, Awka North, Nnewi South, Awka South, Idemili North, Idemili South, Orumba North, Orumba South and Anambra East. “The anonymous letter no doubt is intended to create tension and fear among the peace loving people of the State. “The government assures the good people of Anambra State and residents of their safety and protection as security agencies are jointly working round the clock with government to maintain law and order.” Copyright PUNCH.
