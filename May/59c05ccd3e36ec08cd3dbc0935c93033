The leadership of the Abia State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has forgiven aggrieved members who had earlier engaged in legal battles to topple the state executive committee that emerged through the party congress. According to a statement on Wednesday, the Chairman of Abia APC, Dr. Kingsley Ononogbu, made this known while addressing journalists in Umuahia. An FCT High Court presided over by Justice Babangida Hassan had on Monday struck out the suit filed by the aggrieved group led by the former party chairman, Donatus Nwankpa, and a former federal lawmaker, Acho Obioma. “We have not only forgiven them (litigants) but we are also ready to accommodate them as if nothing has happened. They will be equally accorded their rights and privileges,” Ononogbu said. The party chairman pointed out that the main task before the main Abia opposition party is for the party to successfully conclude its mission to rescue the state from the alleged misrule of the Peoples Democratic Party. He said intra-party squabbles and distractions with endless litigation would not help the party. “As the 2023 general election is just at the corner, all hands must be on the deck. We must forge ahead to complete the task. The time and opportunity to set the state free has come,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
