There are indications that a former Governor of Anambra State and presidential hopeful, Peter Obi,  who dumped the Peoples Democratic Party on Wednesday may join the Labour Party to actualise his presidential ambition. The PUNCH had reported that Obi in a letter addressed to the National Chairman of the PDP, Senator Iyorchia Ayu, announced his resignation from the party saying recent developments within the party had made it impossible for him to continue in the presidential race. He, however, said he was happy to have contributed to the growth of the country through the PDP. The PUNCH learnt that the former Anambra State governor had been in talks with the Labour Party and might be defecting to the party soon. However, it remains unclear if he will be given the party’s automatic ticket as renowned political economist, Prof. Pat Utomi, is expected to pick up the Presidential form of the Labour Party on Thursday. Obi, who enjoys massive support from the youths, had purchased the N40m form of the PDP and was screened to participate in the party’s presidential primary on Saturday. However, it had been difficult for him to bring many of the delegates to his side. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
