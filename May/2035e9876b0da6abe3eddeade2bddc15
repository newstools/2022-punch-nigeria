The immediate past Vice-Chancellor of Abia State University, Uturu, Professor Uche Ikonne, has emerged as the Peoples Democratic Party’s governorship candidate from the primary conducted in Abia. Announcing the result, the Returning Officer, Governor Ayodele Fayose, said Prof. Ikonne polled 468 votes to defeat the closest rival, Mayor Lucky Igbokwe, who polled 45 votes, and Ezinwanyi Jonah, who polled five votes. Out of the 11 aspirants, only three appeared for the primary as the rest eight were said to have withdrawn from the race. Meanwhile, some of the aspirants that withdrew, including a former PDP state chairman, Sen. Emma Nwaka, and Desmond Anyaso said they withdrew from the race which they said was inconsistent with acceptable standards. “This decision is taken timely to enable me completely dissociate myself from a process that is fraught with irregularities, illegalities, and undemocratic acts. As a firm believer and disciple of the tenets of democracy, it would be injurious to my reputation, my aspiration, and the collective hope of those who believe in me if I go ahead and participate in a primary election that is most undemocratic, and at best detrimental to the progress and development of Abia State,” Desmond said. Sen. Nwaka also said he withdrew from the race which he said did not properly follow the democratic process, starting from the selection of the three delegates, even as forms for the delegates were not sold.
