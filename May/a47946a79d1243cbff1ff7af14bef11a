A former Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki has wooed Lagos State Peoples Democratic Party delegates for their votes, ahead of the May 28 and May 29 presidential primary election of the party. Saraki, along with his team, met with PDP leaders at Ikeja on Monday evening. He said that if elected as the next president, Lagos State would be given special attention as an investment destination in the country. The former governor of Kwara said that Nigeria needed a president with action and courage to stand and take some very bold decisions to reposition the nation. Saraki said, “Please, let me appeal to you, I am your own. Let us work together to ensure that we win at the federal and win at the state. “There is nobody among all the aspirants that has the same history and closeness to Lagos State as myself. Do not leave your own to go look for someone outside. “Together we can make this country better. My interest will be your interest. I want to appeal, don’t share your delegate votes, this is my own state. I beg you.” On the calls for “special status” for Lagos, Saraki, who described such status as a special priority, said that state would have special attention in the scheme of things if is elected. He urged the delegates not to be deceived with any gratification, saying leadership that would make Nigeria better should be uppermost. According to him, Nigeria needed a president that has the capacity, knowledge and experience to unite the people, and that he is the best bridge between the North and the South. He said that he had the capacity to reconcile people like he did when he led PDP Reconciliatory Committee which brought peace to some state chapters of the party which were bedevilled with crises. NAN
