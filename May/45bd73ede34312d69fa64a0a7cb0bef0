The Zenith Labour Party, on Thursday in Abuja, called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to ensure the immediate resignation of some of his cabinet members and appointees aspiring to various electoral offices in next year’s elections. The resolution was reached after its National Executive Committee meeting held at its Abuja national secretariat. The opposition party also knocked the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party over “exorbitant nomination fees,” which would incentivise successful aspirants to loot the national treasury. Citing section 84 (12) of the electoral act (2022), the party’s national chairman, Dan Nwanyanwu, lamented Buhari’s silence over the refusal of his ministers and other appointees seeking electoral offices to resign from their current positions. Nwanyanwu said, “NEC condemns the president’s silence on the appointees in the government who are seeking elective offices. It is absurd. It has not happened in our history. “It raises a morality question and ZLP believes that there should be moral content in politics. President Muhammadu Buhari this is not right. “The NEC, therefore, calls on the president to direct all those who have indicated interest to run to resign immediately. It shouldn’t be happening under his watch. “This is not right. It should not be accepted by you. Act as we know you to direct them to resign their position and go contest the positions they want. This is the position of most Nigerians. It is not right and we should not allow it to be a part of our political culture.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
