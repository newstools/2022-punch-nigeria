The senator representing Ondo Central Senatorial District, Ayo Akinyelure, has allegedly collected back the vehicles he gifted the leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party after he lost the just concluded senatorial primary of the party. Akinyelure lost to Mr Dayo Adedipe (SAN), having scored 74 votes behind Adedipe, who polled 78 votes in the primary. After the loss, Akinyelure was said to have blamed the immediate past governor of the state, Dr Olusegun Mimiko, and some other leaders of the party for allegedly causing his downfall in the election. Dissatisfied with the outcome of the election, the senator was alleged to have approached the leaders, some of whom are national delegates, demanding the  return of his vehicles. However, the Special Adviser to the senator on ICT,  Mr Jonathan Ayilaran,  denied the allegation on his Facebook page, saying the senator didn’t demand any vehicle back. Ayilaran maintained that onIine report on the allegation was untrue, describing it as an attempt by detractors to blackmail his principal. He said, “Distinguished Senator Ayo Akinyelure, FCA, did not collect cars he bought for party leaders as claimed on some social media platforms but only collected the car given to him (one of the leaders) from his pool for an assignment and meant to be retuned on completion (sic). “However, the distinguished senator will not be perturbed by cheap and baseless blackmailing as no one can drag the good name he has built over the years in political mud in Ondo State and Nigeria at large.”  Copyright PUNCH.
