Flight operations have resumed at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, after the removal of a mangled body on the runway. A source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, hinted that full flight operations have resumed after the runway was cleared of the mangled corpse of a yet-to-be-identified man. The PUNCH had reported that the international wing of MMIA, Lagos, was temporarily shut in the early hours of Thursday after the mangled body of a dead man was found on Runway 18R. Airport officials said the corpse was suddenly found on Runway 18R during a routine runway inspection by FAAN personnel. However, airport officials had told our correspondent that the runway was temporarily shut down while a team of officials from the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria and the Nigeria Police Force evacuated the corpse from the runway. During the temporary shutdown of the runway, international flights were prevented from landing and taking off from the airport’s international terminal. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
