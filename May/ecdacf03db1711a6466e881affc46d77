I remember the things you said, so I know that you are a man of justice and equity, hence, my confidence in you. “As this administration comes to an end, I would like to call on President Muhammad Buhari to investigate the murder of my mother Kudirat Abiola. “Her anniversary comes up in exactly a month from now. The confession of her murderer Sergeant Rogers must be investigated.” In the social media thread, he lamented that the case of his mother’s death had suffered a setback since the then former Attorney General of Lagos State, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo was no longer the AG in the state. He also called on President Buhari to name her “the Martyr of Democracy,” in “In the Women hall of Fame” Recalled that Kudirat, the wife of late Chief MKO Abiola, was assassinated on June 4, 1996, by unknown assassins allegedly linked to the Abacha junta.
