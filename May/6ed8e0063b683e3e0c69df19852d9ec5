Tension is looming in the Delta community of Agbor as Customs and Army officers on duty along the Benin-Agbor Expressway reportedly assaulted Mr. Samson Nwachuckwu, a human rights volunteer and Special Assistant to the State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa. A Twitter user, Harrison Gwamnishu posted on Sunday that the two uniformed officers jointly assaulted Nwachukwu by slapping him for an undisclosed reason. According to the hashtag Twit #Endimpunity, sighted by PUNCH Metro, Nwachukwu never retaliated “but endured the pain” as he formally lodged complaints of the incident to higher authorities. The Twitter user who is apparently an official of the Human Rights Volunteer declared in the Hashtag Twit that the group members would vehemently protest the assault until the authorities discipline the offending uniformed officers. “We are shutting down that expressway tomorrow (Monday) to demand justice,” the tweep posted.
