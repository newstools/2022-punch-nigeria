No fewer than three soldiers have been arrested for collaborating with terrorists in Zamfara State. While one was arrested for selling ammunition at N100, 000 each, two others were nabbed for collaborating with terrorists. Our correspondent gathered that ammunition had gone missing at a military base in Shinkafi Local Government Area, prompting authorities to investigate the disappearance. A military source told our correspondent that the soldier selling ammunition confessed to the offence after being arrested. The source added that the soldier also planned to sell another round of ammunition for N1million before he was arrested. The source said, “There was a case of missing ammunition at Forward Operations Base in Shinkafi Local Government Area of Zamfara State. An investigation carried out on the case revealed that three soldiers were involved. Two were collaborating with the bandits, and one was arrested for selling ammunition to them. “The soldier confessed to selling about 100 rounds of 7.62 mm SP each at the rate of N100, 000 and promised to sell another quantity of about 1,000 rounds of the same ammunition to bandits at the rate of N1million.” The Director of Army Public Relations, Brig General Onyema Nwachukwu, could not be reached for comment. Calls to his line indicated it was not reachable, while the response to his line on the matter was still being awaited. The development is coming barely 13 days after an official of the Nigerian Army, identified as Lance Corporal Jubril, reportedly committed suicide after being arrested over his alleged connection with the Islamic State of West Africa Province terrorists in Gaidam, Yobe State.
