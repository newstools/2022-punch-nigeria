The Lagos State Government in collaboration with Nondunna Limited has started plans to ensure a transition into a circular economy model of tackling gas emissions in the state. The Head of Climate Change and Environmental Planning Department, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Bankole Omoniyi, disclosed this on Monday during a workshop organised for the state ministries and agencies in Alausa, Ikeja. Omoniyi explained that Lagos State Environment Protection Agency and the Lagos State Resilience Office will work together with Nondunna Limited to implement the circular economy in the state. He said, “A circular economy is a regenerative system in which resource input and waste, emissions, and energy leakage are minimised by slowing, closing, and narrowing energy and material loops and the nation stands to benefit immensely if the policy is fully adopted in the country. “Circular economy also calculates that 62 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions (excluding those from land use and forestry) are released during the extraction, processing, and manufacturing of goods to serve society’s needs; and 38 per cent are emitted in the delivery and use of products and services “The total carbon emission in Lagos State was estimated at 26,443,656 tCO2e in 2015, hence the need to implement the project which is themed, ‘Facilitating the transition to circular economy and the building of an environmentally resilient Lagos.” The Information Technology Consultant of Nondunna Limited, Mr Stephen Adetutu-Oniya, said IT would be deployed for use in order to implement the project through the circular economy and resilience dashboard and Web App.  Copyright PUNCH.
