Ralf Rangnick feels Manchester United need to strengthen in every area of the pitch apart from goalkeeper, where they have “three excellent” options. United stopped talk of a potential walk-out demonstration by beating Brentford 3-0 in Rangnick’s final home game as interim manager. Old Trafford had a feel-good environment for the game after a wretched season as it closed its doors for the summer with farewells to a host of first-team players who are out of contract. Nemanja Matic, Juan Mata, Phil Jones and Edinson Cavani in all probability made their final Old Trafford appearances, while Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard are also out of contract in the summer. Rangnick told Sky Sports, “Apart from goalkeeping where we have three excellent goalkeepers in Tom Heaton, Dean Henderson and David de Gea, in all other areas there will be players leaving the club. I wouldn’t put focus on special areas of the pitch – it should go through the whole team. “So far we haven’t been able to speak [to Ten Hag]. Erik’s focus is on winning the Dutch league, our focus was on our games. “It’s obvious quite a few players will leave and there is a need for top-quality players. I strongly believe that if everyone works together we can bring Man Utd back to where we need to be. “Other clubs only needed two or three transfer windows to challenge but from now on we need to bring in top-quality players who really help raise the level. If this happens then I don’t think it should take too long.”
