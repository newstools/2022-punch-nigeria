The minister of Niger delta affairs, Godswill Akpabio has resigned from the cabinet of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari(retd). This was disclosed in a statement released by his aide, Jackson Udom, late Wednesday. This is as the media aide to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Jibrilu Gwandu, kept mum on the resignation plans of his principal, Abubakar Malami, SAN who has picked up the governorship form for Kebbi state under the ruling All Progressives Congress. The PUNCH had reported that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari(retd.), directed that all members of his cabinet and appointees vying for electoral offices resign on or before May 16, 2022. The order which came on Wednesday was announced during the Federal Executive Council meeting and presided over by the President at the Council Chambers of the State House, Abuja. “Our attention has been drawn to mischievously written news stories making the rounds by paid agents of some politicians, that the leading presidential aspirant, Senator Godswill Akpabio, has purportedly withdrawn from the presidential race. This is a joke carried too far. “This is certainly the handiwork of those who are scared of contesting against Senator Godswill Akpabio. “Senator Akpabio has resigned his appointment as Minister, Niger Delta Affairs Ministry and will soon submit his nomination form at the International Conference Centre, Abuja, in line with his party’s guidelines,” the statement by Udom said. So far, other ministers who have resigned include the Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu, and the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba. Copyright PUNCH.
