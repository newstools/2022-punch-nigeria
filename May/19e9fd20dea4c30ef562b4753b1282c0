The Anambra State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party screening committee has cleared its candidate in the November 6, 2021, governorship election, Valentine Ozigbo, for the party’s primaries ahead of the senatorial election in 2023. Ozigbo is contesting the Anambra South Senatorial District seat in the National Assembly. This was contained in the report of the five-man screening committee held on April 27. The report which was signed by SKE Udeh Okoye and other members of the committee indicated that Uche Ekwunife and Stella Oduah, both sitting Senators, were also cleared. Other members of the screening committee were the Secretary, Eddy Izondu, Dr Angela Mba, Dr Innocent Nwankwo, and Alhaji Rukayat Ibrahim. Others cleared were Chief Chris Ubah, Ezebiakwa Peace, Tony Nwoye, John Emeka and Obinna Uzoh. Chuma Nzeribe was the only aspirant disqualified out of the nine screened from Anambra. The Committee said Nzeribe, a former Senator, was disqualified on the grounds of being declared wanted by existing court order and denial that he had not been tried by any court of law. It said Nzeribe misled the party by not declaring his status in the eyes of the law and as a man who jumped bail and was declared wanted. “We have, in our possession, a Court Order in Charge No. CR/791/2020, between FRN v. Hon. Chuma Nzeribe, before Hon. Justice Y. Halilu. “On December 17, 2020, Hon. Chuman Nzeribe was admitted to bail, after he pleaded not guilty to the charges on December 16, 2020. He subsequently breached the bail terms and jumped bail,” the party stated. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
