A 25-year-old teacher, one Ayobami  Runsewe, has been arrested by the Ogun State Police Command for allegedly defiling a nine-year-old pupil in the Ago-Iwoye area of the state. Sunday PUNCH learnt that Runsewe, a class teacher at a nursery and primary school in the area, allegedly lured the victim to his house in the Ayegbami area after the school lesson at about 4:30pm and forcibly had unlawful carnal knowledge of her. It also gathered that the suspect was arrested on Thursday following a complaint by the mother of the pupil at the Ago-Iwoye Divisional Headquarters. The state police spokesperson, SP Abimbola Oyeyemi, on Saturday disclosed that the victim’s mother went to the station with her daughter to lodge a complaint. He said, “The blood-soaked pants of the victim were brought to the station as evidence. Upon the report, the DPO Ago Iwoye, SP Noah Adekanye, detailed his detectives to the scene, where the randy teacher was promptly arrested.” The PPRO added that Runsewe initially denied the allegation but couldn’t speak further when the pupil confronted him. “On interrogation, he initially denied having anything to do with the victim. But when the victim confronted him, he was unable to say anything further,” Oyeyemi added. He, however, said the Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, had ordered the immediate transfer of the suspect to anti-human trafficking and child labour unit of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for further investigation and possible prosecution.
