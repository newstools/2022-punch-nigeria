Manchester City are interested in signing Paul Pogba on a free transfer in what could become one of the most explosive deals in British transfer history. But Pogba will not make a final decision about his future until the end of the season, when his Manchester United contract expires, according to reports. Sky Sports reported last month the France international, who is thought to have played his final game for United as he is out with a calf injury, has not ruled out staying in the Premier League. It is understood two clubs from England’s top flight have been in touch with Pogba’s camp. Reports have emerged of interest from United’s rivals Manchester City and Sky Sports News has been told Pogba will look at every concrete offer presented to him. Real Madrid, Juventus and PSG remain interested in signing him on a free transfer, six years after United signed Pogba from the Italian club for a then world record £93.25m. Pogba is free to talk to clubs outside England, but cannot officially negotiate with English clubs until he is out of contract. City were interested in Pogba in 2018, while he is a known admirer of Pep Guardiola. United, who are set to miss out on Champions League qualification, have not offered fresh terms to Pogba since last summer. Pogba is 29 and believes the next deal he signs will be the most important of his career.
