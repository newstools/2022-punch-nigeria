The Multinational Joint Task Force has said no fewer than 200,000 persons displaced by the Boko Haram terrorists have been resettled in their ancestral homes. It said the displaced persons were from Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria and Niger Republic between 2021 till date. Data obtained from the MNJTF showed that a total of 117,193 were returned to 18 villages in Cameroon; in Chad, 22,112 displaced persons were returned to 20 villages; In Nigeria, 47,126 persons were returned to five communities and in Niger Republic 30,735 persons returned to 20 communities. The document partly read, “The successes of our operations have led to the defeat of several terrorists from many villages which were BHTs (Boko Haram Terrorists) strongholds with a corresponding rescue of thousands of captives. Consequently, safe and secure environments were thus created which has led to the return of many internally displaced persons and refugees. “The inhabitants of these sacked villages therefore had no option than to relocate to other safe haven either as internally displaced persons for those that relocated within the shores of their countries or as refugees for those that left for neighboring countries. “For the period 2021 to date, over 200,000 IDPs/refugees spread across the four sectors of the MNJTF have safely returned to their ancestral homes.
