Nigeria Professional Football League side, Kwara United, has debunked claims that the club had signed a new coach in place of Abdullahi Biffo, who travelled to the United States for medical treatment. According to club chairman, Kumbi Titiloye, the former Abia Warriors and Katsina United gaffer was granted some days off to travel abroad for urgent medical treatment. “We are not hiring another coach because Biffo will soon return after his treatment in the US, with his assistants in charge in subsequent games,” Titiloye said. With this, Lukman Ijaiya and Mukaila Iyala are expected to be in charge of Kwara United’s NPFL match-day 30 encounter against Akwa United on Saturday in Ilorin. Ijaiya and Iyala worked for years as youth coaches at Kwara, before their recent elevation to the first team. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
