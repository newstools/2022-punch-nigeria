The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has approved the appointment of Brigadier-General Mohammed Fada as the new Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps. Fada, from Yobe State, will take over from Major General Shuaibu Ibrahim who spent two tenures. A source made this known to our correspondent on Tuesday. “The Federal Government has appointed a new Director-General for the NYSC; he’s Brigadier General Mohammed Fada from Yobe State. He was in NYSC on Tuesday and has been briefed by the outgoing DG, Major General Shuaibu Ibrahim. “After the farewell parade, Ibrahim will come and hand over and leave. It is good that when you’re leaving, it should be tears of joy and instead of people praying, ‘let this stupid go’ and tenure of three years will be like 20 years,” the source said. Ibrahim, a native of Nasarawa LGA in Nasarawa State, is an Associate Professor of History and War Studies at the Nigerian Defence Academy. He assumed office in May 2019 and prior to his appointment as the 18th DG of NYSC, he was the Registrar of the Nigerian Army University, Biu, Borno State. He has a Bachelor’s degree in History (1989), M.A. in History (1992), also in UNIJOS and PhD in History (2007) at the University of Abuja. But in 2007, he finished his PGDE at Tai Solarin University of Education, Ogun State. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
