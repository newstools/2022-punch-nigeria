Nigerian Soya Bean
We are grateful for the cooperation shown by Nigerian poultry feed producers in the supply of samples of soyabean meal for this survey of Nigerian sources of soyabean meal. A total of 22 soya bean meals were submitted by 3 major producers of feed during the month of September 2021. The samples originated from 12 different bean crushers with between 1 and 5 samples per source.
The below table gives the result determined by our sister company Aunir, an ABVISTA business, through their unique feeds quality service using NIR technology to assess ingredients. The data presented shows that on average the 12 soya bean processors gave material that compares favourably with the average determined for European, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) samples tested by Aunir in the period 1st August to 1st October 2021.
• Moisture is consistent and low compared to EMEA samples.
• Protein is good at 46.1% average for all 22 samples tested, one source gave a lower value of 41.1% (this was retested and value confirmed), removing this sample lifts the average to 46.3%. similarly taking this low protein out of the average determined for the 12 individual sources increases the protein from 45.9% to 46.3%. EMEA value for protein is slightly higher at 47.4%. Where more than one sample per crusher was tested the values are consistent.
• Oil is variable according to source and will be a reflection of the different crushers objective in extracting oil. Values ranges from 1.21 to 4.8%. The overall average is same as the values for EMEA but with a higher standard deviation (S.D.)
• Fibre is higher than the EMEA average 6.1% vs. 4.4% with one source having a value of 10.5%, this is the same source that gave the low protein. Taking this sample out reduces the average to 5.9% which is still above that determined for the EMEA samples. Level of fibre is an indication of either incomplete dehulling of beans or the adding back of the hulls after oil extraction.
• In terms of the degree of heat treatment used in processing the results are very encouraging. The urease value for 21 out of the 22 samples is less than 0.1 the exception being the low protein/high fibre source. The values compare well with the EMEA data. In addition, the reactive lysine as a % total lysine is 94% across all sources showing that heat treatment has not been excessive.
Overall the results indicate that good quality soyabean meal is available and used by the Nigerian feed industry, consistency is the key to effective raw material use. The data generated by the Aunir analysis shows that individual sources of soya bean meal, where multiple samples were tested, are consistent in their analysis.
Knowing the analysis and variation within a source of raw material allows most effective evaluation and use of that material and having this knowledge is recommended by Premier Nutrition. The service provided by Aunir is a valuable tool in optimizing diet formulation and product performance.
The Anunir analysis service also provides full suits of values for phytic phosphorus, fibre fractions, essential amino acids, SID poultry amino acids, AID and SID pig amino acids.
