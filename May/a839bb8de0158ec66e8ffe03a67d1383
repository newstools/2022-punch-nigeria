Business Mogul, and international pop star, Rihanna, was honoured with a statue of herself at the Metropolitan Art Museum in New York. While she was unable to attend the Met Gala on Monday, the museum paid tribute to the singer at the event held on Monday. In the montage posted on her official Twitter page, the Umbrella singer’s pregnant figure stood regal alongside other historic statues. The sculpted image was designed after her cover spread in the Vogue Magazine’s May issue, where she posed with her baby bump in a sheer catsuit and gave an exclusive on her pregnancy journey. Notorious for her unconventional maternity style, Rihanna has made several public appearances baring her baby bump. In the interview, she expressed hope that society redefines “what is considered descent” for pregnant women. Reacting to the video, the singer tweeted on Tuesday, “Shut down the Met in marble! What’s more gilded than that? Lol! Thank you @metmuseum and @voguemagazine for this historic tribute! Y’all bad for this one!” The annual event saw celebrities from all walks of life gracing the red carpet. The dress code, Glided Glamour and White Tie, had the stars delving into the fashion archives of the late nineteenth-century New York. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
