A governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress in Abia State, Chief Daniel Eke, has faulted the process of the conduct of governorship primary by the party in the state. Eke described the process as distrustful and unacceptable. He made this statement Thursday in Umuahia while the party’s governorship primary was going on elsewhere, stating that as an aspirant, he was not in the know about the details of the primary. “We have election today, but I don’t have information on the time, venue and modalities. I don’t know if it is direct or indirect,” the aggrieved aspirant said. Eke said he had called and messaged the party’s National Office without any response, stating that “I believe it is illegal for an aspirant not to be informed about what is going on. I have been calling (the) National Office for three days and nobody has answered me. “Last night (Wednesday), I sent a text message to the National Organising Secretary, nothing has happened up till now.” He further queried, “How can we do election through delegates when no delegate election took place? INEC (the Independent National Electoral Commission) should look into this.” According to Eke, with the fake information circulating around, the National Office should have come out with a directive and tell the people what the process was, adding, “anything else is out of process.” He said he would slug it out with the party through its national office.
