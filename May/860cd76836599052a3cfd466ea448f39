NIGERIA’S U-17 women’s national team, Flamingos, must overcome their Ethiopian counterparts to earn a ticket to this year’s U-17 Women’s World Cup finals in India in October. Coach Bankole Olowookere’s side defeated Egypt 2-0 in Cairo on Saturday night, with top scorer Opeyemi Ajakaiye opening the account in the fifth minute, before Aminat Bello added a second nine minutes later at the Petrosports Stadium, Cairo for a 6-0 aggregate win. Ethiopia defeated South Africa 3-0 in Johannesburg in the first leg of their third round clash, only to lose 1-0 to the South Africans in Addis Ababa on Saturday. The Ethiopians had edged Uganda on the away-goal rule in the second round, with aggregate score stalemated at 3-3. Not only are the Flamingos, who have played in every edition of the U-17 Women’s World Cup, bar one, undefeated in the qualifying series, they are yet to concede a goal. They hammered DR Congo 3-0 in Kinshasa and 5-0 in Benin City for an 8-0 aggregate score, before sending the Egyptians packing 6-0. The nifty Ajakaiye is top scorer with five goals, having scored in each of Nigeria’s four matches, with a brace against the Congolese in Benin City. The first leg of the Nigeria/Ethiopia final round fixture holds May 21, with the second leg two weeks later.
