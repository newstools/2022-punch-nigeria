Former President of the Senate and presidential aspirant under the Peoples Democratic Party, Anyim Pius Anyim, has protested the absence of a list of delegates from Ebonyi State ahead of the PDP presidential primaries. Anyim made this known in an open letter of concern issued on Friday addressed to the PDP National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, and Chairman of the PDP Special Convention, Senator David Mark. In a statement made available to The PUNCH on Friday, signed by Anyim’s Special Adviser, Sam Nwaobasi, Anyim lamented that he had gone through the list of delegates from other states and the FCT but could not find that of Ebonyi State delegates. Anyim noted with dismay, that despite assurances by the National Organising Secretary of the Party that the ‘technical error’ would be rectified, the problem remained as at 12 noon on Friday 27th May. The letter titled ‘Open Letter on the Absence of Ebonyi State Delegates List’ reads, “The Chairman may recall that during the meeting of Presidential aspirants and the Special Convention Committee held on the 26th day of May 2022 at the Legacy House, the entire delegates list for all the states were presented to each of the aspirants. “On an examination of the list, I discovered that the Ebonyi State delegates list was not included. On inquiry from the National Organizing Secretary, he informed me that there was a technical error and it will be corrected today. “As at the time of writing this letter i.e. 12 noon 27th/05/2022, I have no clue about the fate of the delegates from Ebonyi State. “The purpose of this letter is to alert all concerned that disenfranchising delegates from Ebonyi State or any state for that matter will fundamentally affect the election.” Copyright PUNCH.
