American boxer and promoter, Floyd Mayweather, says he plans to establish a boxing academy in Africa, especially in Nigeria to build young fighters. Mayweather, a former WBC Super featherweight champion, stated this when he visited All Progressives Congress presidential aspirant and Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, at his Abuja residence early Monday morning. “The ultimate plan is to find the next Mayweather. I want to work with kids; I will come over to meet and talk to make sure we are all on the same page, and slowly start building these fighters. We just want to help,” Mayweather said. “It’s all about giving back, helping the youths and the young generation coming up. I want to build a boxing camp for the kids. Different American trainers will come over and work with them. “There are so many talents in the sports world over there in the United States, and Africa is dominating in the US now. There are so many hidden talents, so many skills, so we want the world to see these skills. “We don’t want it to be hidden, like I was able to display my skills and talents to the world, here I am today. I want to build an academy just for the children to grow.” In response, Amaechi told the boxing great that he believed the Federal Government would support any initiative to harness more talents in the country, which would also create jobs.
