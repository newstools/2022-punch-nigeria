The Joint Action Committee of the Non Academic Staff Union of educational and associated institutions and the senior staff of Nigerian universities will today meet with the the Federal Ministry of Education “to present the payment platform on which they want to be paid to Education Minister,Adamu Adamu”. This was contained in a statement by the ministry’s spokesperson, Ben Goong, said on Tuesday. The PUNCH has reported how the two unions like the Academic Staff Union of Universities had rejected the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System introduced by the Federal Government for the payment of workers salaries. While ASUU had introduced the University Transparency Accountability System, the JAC of SSANU and NASU had introduced the University Peculiar Payroll Payment System. “These are the reasons why we decided to assist the government by coming up with a solution that would take care of the universities’ peculiarities because the university is not like the regular public or civil service. “Our retirement age is 65; we also have sabbatical leave, where our members can go to other universities, share experiences and gain more knowledge while they will be receiving salaries in their mother stations as well as the new places”, the National President of SSANU, Muhammed Ibrahim, had stated in an interview with The PUNCH. The meeting is scheduled to commence by 2pm Today(Tuesday). Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
