Former Governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, has begged delegates from Gombe State to support his aspiration to become president of Nigeria. Tinubu made the plea on Tuesday, during a consultative meeting with delegates, where he lamented the current challenges of the country. Tinubu said, “Today is the day I have come to ask for your support to be president of Nigeria. You can put me there with your voters. “I believe in myself, I’m confident, capable, intelligent, courageous, brave, determined, and the government is not a joke. In the coming delegate election. Choose wisely, choose me, I beg you ooo.” The All Progressives Congress chieftain said he would tackle insecurity head on, stressing that his government would develop contemporary measures in ridding the country of criminality. He revealed that they have the power to consolidate his quest to the number one position of Nigeria, adding that he has the capacity to reposition the country. “We have an opportunity to change Nigeria, I guarantee we will change Nigeria. The change in Lagos is just beginning, the change that made Lagos the richest state in Africa now. We will collaborate with all the states of the federation,” he added. On his part, Chief of Staff to Gombe State Governor, Inuwa Kari, said it is pay back time, revealing that Tinubu has worked assiduously for the growth of the APC. Kari, who doubles as state coordinator of Asiwaju movement 2023 in Gombe, added that people should rally round the national leader towards realising his aspiration. He said, “We know what we did to put the party together. Through this great man, we are at the Villa, and we are in charge of the government in Gombe.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
