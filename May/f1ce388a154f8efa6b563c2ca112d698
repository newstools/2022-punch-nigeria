Mexico’s head coach, Gerardo Martino, has announced a 38-man squad list to face Nigeria on May 28 in an international friendly billed for the AT&T Stadium, Arlington, Dallas, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. El Tri – who will be featuring at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar – will also face Ecuador at the Red Bull Arena in Harrison on June 2. Martino named veteran goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa, LA Galaxy’s Julian Araujo as well as Wolverhampton Wanderers’ Raul Jimenez. Others in the squad are Atletico Madrid midfielder Hector Herrera, Israel Reyes, Luis Romo and Orbelin Pineda, who feature for Celta Vigo in the Spanish LaLiga.

A double from Herrera and lone goals from Rogelio Funes Mori and Jonathan dos Santos steered El Tri to a comfortable victory as they wrapped up preparations for their 2021 Concacaf Gold Cup campaign in style. The two teams will be meeting for the seventh time ever with four of their previous encounters ending draws. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
