Nigeria’s Ambassador to Spain, Chief Demola Seriki, has purchased the N20m senatorial form of the All Progressives Congress to contest the Lagos-Central senatorial seat. Seriki, a former Minister of State for Defence and Supervising Minister for Mines and Steel, is seeking to succeed Lagos-Central senator, Mrs. Remi Tinubu, the wife of APC national leader, Bola Tinubu. The envoy will, however, be going up against the Deputy Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Wasiu Eshilokun. The Lagos Central senatorial district comprises five local governments including Surulere, Eti Osa, Lagos Island, Apapa, and Lagos Mainland. In his manifesto, the envoy promised to focus on security, education, mass transportation, roads and infrastructure, housing, health, environment, agriculture, and economic, social, youth and women development. His pledge reads in part, “A senator is expected to effectively articulate the position and expectation of his or her district and constituents with possession of eloquence prowess. In particular Lagos State being the most important state in Nigeria and the second largest economy in West Africa only after Nigeria. “Hence, Lagos requires a quality senator. I have worked effectively over the years with the National Assembly members while I was a Minister of the Federal Government in various ministries namely: Agriculture, Water Resources, Mines and Steel, Defence and Interior. “With humility, I know the functionality of the Senate with its oversight process and procedure and will garner the experiences to benefit my people in Lagos Central in particular and Lagos State in general.” Copyright PUNCH.
