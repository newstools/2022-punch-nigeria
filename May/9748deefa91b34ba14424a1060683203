The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria has commended Henkel’s commitment to the growth of the country’s manufacturing sector and economy. The association gave the commendation when Henkel’s top management, led by its Chairman and Managing Director, Rajat Kapur, paid a courtesy visit to MAN in Lagos, according to a statement on Friday. Kapur, who was in company with Henkel’s Head of Manufacturing, Roman Rylyk, and Head of R&D, Innocent Ojiaku, explained that the company was into detergent production and saw itself as “a trusted partner and a strong contributor to the Nigerian economy.” He said, “Secure energy supply, the availability of critical raw materials, and access to foreign exchange are amongst the key topics within the manufacturing industry in Nigeria. As a leading multinational who is committed to growing our business and industrial activities safely, responsibly, and successfully, we believe that open dialogue and exchange with key stakeholders is critical.” In response, Director-General, MAN, Ajayi-Kadir said, “Our door remains open and we encourage you to continue to play an active part in the association’s activities, as it would not just address some of the issues you raised today, but will also help the manufacturing sector as a whole.”  Copyright PUNCH.
