A Lokoja High Court presided by Justice Nicodemus Awulu has adjourned till May 23, 2022, further hearing on the suit challenging the appointment of Abubakar Yakubu as Ejeh of Ankpa. Awulu adjourned the suit after a new lawyer of the defendants filed a new application. A high court of Kogi State had earlier restrained the state government from carrying out the planned coronation of Yakubu as Ejeh of Ankpa. Given on March 2, the order was based on an interlocutory application filed by three ruling houses of the Onu Enjema traditional clan in Enjema District of Ankpa Local Council, Guardian reported. The order restrained Yakubu from “parading or further parading himself as the Ejeh of Ankpa pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit in this honourable court.” Counsel to the plaintiffs, Philip Abalaka, has said that they were challenging the application by the defendants to vacate the earlier order of Judge Funsho Ajayi of Anyigba High Court.
