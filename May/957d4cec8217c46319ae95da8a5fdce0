The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said his administration is anchored on the provision of training and capacity building for workers in the state. The governor stated this on Sunday during his address at the 2022 International Workers’ Day celebration held at Onikan. Sanwo-Olu explained that the quest for good governance and development in the state can be achieved through organised labour working with a political system that is able to deliver the dividends of democracy to all citizens. He said, “Training and capacity building are central pillars, in our view, of the management of our organised labour. I wish to emphasise that our development agenda is anchored on the existence of a skilful, productive, competitive and adaptive human resource base. “To this end, we will shortly be ensuring that a 12-member delegation drawn from our Labour leaders and the Lagos State Government attends the forthcoming International Labour Organisation Convention in Geneva, to further expose them to international best labour practices. “Furthermore, the recently established Lateef Jakande Leadership Academy, which will commence operations in June 2022, aims to develop future leaders in our public service by equipping participants with the requisite skills and instilling in them the ethics and values of purposeful leadership, through direct mentoring and on-the-job training.” Copyright PUNCH.
