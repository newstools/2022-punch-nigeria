Kate Jones, a reality TV star popularly known as Ka3na, has thrown in her hat for the race to be Nigeria’s next President. The self-acclaimed boss lady made this known with a poster shared via her Instagram page on Wednesday. The Big Brother Season Five housemate also indicated that she would be running under the umbrella of the All Progressives Congress. “The cat’s out of the bag. #Ka3naForPresident #PresidentofNigeria #APC #Letyourvotecount #PeacefulElection,” she captioned the post. With her declaration to run for president, she would be slugging it out with the likes of Vice President Yemi Osibanjo; APC National Leader, Bola Tinubu; former Ogun State governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, and several others vying for the presidential ticket under the party. Notably, the mother of one announced she had relocated to the United Kingdom in March, following her divorce from husband, Mr. Jones. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
