It was a very sad moment when the news broke to me about the gruesome murder of David Sunday Imoh. It was like a joke or a April fool when a WhatsApp message was sent to my wife, by Bolu, one of our daughters in the faith. It reads, “My husband has died”! We quickly called her and she revealed to me how some Hausa Okada boys stabbed, killed and burnt her husband, David, at the Lekki area of Lagos. It was like a dream, I don’t really know where we are heading in this nation. I have known David Sunday Imoh to be an easygoing boy for more than 15 years as a young man, later his wife (who happened to be the assistant Choir Director in our ministry for more than seven years) brought him to me as a suitor. They got married and gave birth to two lovely children. He later became a sound engineer assisting our ministry and working in many churches with their sounds for several years. I call on the government especially Lagos State and the Nigeria Police as a matter of urgency to bring everybody involved in this wicked act to book with immediate effect. David Sunday Imoh must not die in vain; Bolu who they turned to a young widow in her thirties , his parents, two little children who are now fatherless must not be made to suffer in vain. Let there be #justicefordave. Pastor Adewale wrote in from Lagos Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
