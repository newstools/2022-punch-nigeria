Nollywood actress, Nkechi Blessing, and her ex-lover, Opeyemi Falegan, have again traded words on social media after the politician called out the actress over her personal hygiene. In a video shared by Falegan, he stated that he had publicly apologised to the actress to let the matter slide and not because he wanted her to come back. In the now-deleted video which he shared on the Instagram page, Falegan revealed that he broke up with the actress because of her personal hygiene. Falegan said in the video, “I apologised to her because I just want bygone to be bygone. Not because I want her back. Are you serious? Do you know why I left? I left for a different reason. Personal hygiene. “You have to tell a woman to change her pants in three days. You have to tell a woman to brush her teeth in the morning. After the whole thing, everywhere is messed up. Do you want me to manage that? No, I wouldn’t.” In response, the actress debunked his claims, adding that she didn’t even own panties since she was 18. “I’m glad your lies are staring into your face. It’s a known fact that I NBS have never worn a pant since I was 18. Opeyemi, just wow. “That was a weak comeback bro. Leave me alone in peace. When talking about hygiene. Please clean that rat hole you live in first. This battle is a lost one already. Stay dead, please. “Why is it so hard for you to move on? is it by force? If I decide to go that route with you, you will not like me. Leave me alone!” This unfolded barely 48 hours after Falegan publicly apologised to Nkechi, and the actress, in response, flaunted another ex-lover, Mike Adeyemi, on her Instagram stories.
