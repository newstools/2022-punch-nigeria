Mr Seun Odofin, an aide to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Femi Gbajabiamila, is seeking the ticket of the All Progressives Congress for Obokun/Oriade Federal Constituency for the 2023 general election. Odofin, an indigene of Ijebu-Jesa, the headquarters of Oriade Local Government Area of Osun State, in a statement issued by his campaign office, obtained in Osogbo on Saturday, also said the opportunity of working with Gbajabiamila had given him exposure needed to be a good federal parliamentarian. He went further to advocate a peaceful contest in the elections. He expressed concern that the Federal Constituency, despite possessing a rich political history and having produced a governor for the old Oyo State in 1979, had not fully benefitted from several opportunities. He, however, called on the electorate in the constituency to ensure that whoever the APC gave its ticket to was supported to win the poll. “I have seen it all working with Rt. Hon Femi Gbajabiamila and I believe I have the strength, exposure, patience, and other qualities to represent an elite constituency like Obokun/Oriade in the House of Representatives. But let’s have a peaceful contest. “I sincerely thank Hon Gbajabiamila for his investment in we the youths that he is working with and I believe my federal constituency and Osun at large will eventually reap full benefits of all of these. We can’t afford to remain in the opposition. We have to join the mainstream to be able to benefit maximally,” Odofin concluded. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
