Rima Queens, Defenders Babes and Benue Queens emerged victorious on Monday at the ongoing Prudent Energy Handball Premier League at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja. Rima, who are currently second on the log in the female category, had to dig deep to beat former champions, Adorable Angels, 24-23 in a match that could have gone either way. The defeat is the fifth for the Angels, who seem to be in disarray in the first phase of this year’s edition. Benue Queens also defeated Plateau Peacocks 23-21 in a keenly-contested tie. The game brought out the best in both teams as they battled hard for a win to better their standings on the log. But it was the Queens who did enough to win the game. Seasider Babes of Lagos are finding the going tough in the league as they lost to Defender Babes 36-27. The Lagos team are also struggling and will be hoping to do better before the second phase of the league, which comes up later in the year. It was an off day for Bendel Dynamos as they walked over Kada Queens to grab the maximum two points and 10 goals. In the male category, Rima Strikers lost to Safety Shooters 35-20, Police Machine narrowly defeated Benue Buffalos 17-16, while D-Defenders beat Owena Kings 35-27.
