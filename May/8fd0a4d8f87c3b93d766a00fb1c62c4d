A total of 383 visually impaired candidates are participating in the ongoing Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examinations organised by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board. The Chairman, JAMB Equal Opportunity Group and coordinator of the Lagos centre, Prof. Peter Okebukola, made this known on Thursday while monitoring the examination process at the Distance Learning Centre of the University of Lagos. He added that the UNILAG centre had in attendance 59 blind candidates, saying it started in on May 12  and would end on May 13, 2022  at 11  accredited centres including Abuja, Ado-Ekiti, Bauchi, Benin, Enugu, Jos, Kano, Kebbi, Lagos, Oyo and Yola. “It is worth stressing that the blind candidates take the same test items as those who are not blind. “The mode of examination is blended – use of PCs and use of the traditional Braille slate and stylus/typewriters in writing answers to questions that are read out by a subject expert. “This is in alignment with the current state of development of Nigeria’s higher education system with regard to education of the blind. “JEOG is already implementing a strategic plan of gradually increasing the ICT component of administration of the UTME to match the improvement in ICT usage for the education of the blind in the universities, polytechnics and colleges of education. Okebukola, commended the JAMB Registrar, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede, for a well-planned, seamless exercise. Other eminent scholars present at the opening exercise include the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Lagos, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, and the Director of the DLC, UNILAG Mrs Uche Udeani.
