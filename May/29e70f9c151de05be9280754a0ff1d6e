The Embassy of the State of Palestine in Nigeria has opened a condolence register for Palestinian veteran journalist, Shireen Akleh, who was reportedly shot dead by Israeli forces while covering a raid by the security personnel in the West Bank on Wednesday. The mission said the book would remain open from Thursday to Saturday, May 14, between 10 am and 3 pm daily at the Embassy of Palestine, behind the United Nations House, Central Business District, Abuja. Akleh, who worked for Al Jazeera, had gone to the Jenin refugee camp to report on a raid by Israeli soldiers and security forces when she was killed. The Palestinian Health Ministry said the deceased reporter was hit in the head by a live bullet during the raid. She was taken to the hospital in critical condition and later pronounced dead. Video of the shooting showed  that Akleh was wearing a blue flak jacket clearly marked with the word ‘press’ as well as a helmet. The Qatar-based network alleged that the reporter was shot deliberately and in cold blood by the Israeli troops in Jenin. Another Palestinian journalist, Al Jazeera producer, Ali Samoudi, was also shot in the back and is in a stable condition in the hospital. “We were going to film the Israeli army operation and suddenly they shot us without asking us to leave or stop filming.” “The first bullet hit me and the second bullet hit Shireen. There was no Palestinian military resistance at all at the scene,” he added. Explaining the incident, the Israeli military said, “During the activity, tens of Palestinian gunmen fired at and hurled explosive devices toward the soldiers. The soldiers responded with fire toward the gunmen and hits were identified.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
