New Super Eagles coach, Jose Peseiro, says that he is proud of his makeshift team despite their 2-1 defeat to Mexico in their friendly game at the AT&T Stadium in Dallas on Saturday night. It was Peseiro first game since taking over the Eagles’ job following his appointment earlier this month. Not the usual 4-4-2 or 4-3-3 formation as the Portuguese went for a 3-5-2 formation, with Moses Simon and Calvin Bassey deployed as wing-backs. Joe Aribo, Alex Iwobi and Innocent Bonke played in midfield while Cyriel Dessers and Terem Moffi were charged with the responsibility o getting for the goals. It was the Eagles’ first outing since the disappointment of 2022 World Cup ticket miss against Ghana and the team put a great performance but narrowly lost to their opponents. The three-time African champions had eight shots on goal compared to Mexico’s 12, while Francis Uzoho made four saves as against Rodolfo Cota’s one. Despite the defeat, Peseiro insisted he was proud of the team’s performance. “Although we didn’t win last night, I am very proud of the boys,” the former Real Madrid assistant manager wrote on Twitter. “The team showed character and resilience. A special mention to the 4 NPFL players who had the chance to debut with the national team. Welcome!” Up next for the Eagles is another friendly game against Ecuador at the Red Bull Arena in Harrison, New Jersey on Thursday.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
