The embattled Peoples Democratic Party governorship aspirant in Rivers State, Hon. Farah Dagogo is set to regain his freedom after being in incarceration for almost one month. This was because a Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt and presided by Justice E A. Obile on Monday ordered Dagogo’s release on bail from the Port Harcourt correctional centre. The order came a few hours after a Federal High Court in Abuja ordered the PDP, and Independent National Electoral Commission to show reason on May 24 why the federal lawmaker/aspirant’s application seeking an injunction against the two defendants in respect of the governorship primary in the state should not be granted. Dagogo was brought to court in a wheelchair on the warrant of Justice E A Obile. Justice Obile issued a warrant to the officials of the correctional center to produce him (Dagogo) in court and be released on bail based on subsisting orders. But operatives of the correctional centre took Dagogo back to the high walls along Dockyard Road in the old Port Harcourt township to regularise all bail requirements which was expected to be concluded soon. Meanwhile, Dagogo’s counsel, Dr. Innocent Ekwu, had threatened to initiate contempt of court proceedings against all authorities if an attempt was made to subvert the order of the court. Dr. Ekwu said, “The prison officials have promises that in an hour they would be through with documentation of his(Dagogo) release. “And we want to give the benefit of the doubt. We will be here waiting for them for an hour and if we wait till 6 pm we do not see them, then we are going to initiate contempt of court proceeding against all authorities that are involved in the subversion.” Copyright PUNCH.
