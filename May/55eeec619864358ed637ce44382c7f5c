The immediate past President of the Senate and presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, Dr Bukola Saraki, has unveiled plans to tackle the country’s challenges. According to a statement released by his Head of Digital Media, Olu Onemola, Saraki had, since last year, held meetings with hundreds of policy experts from across the country who have contributed to the development of his detailed 5-point agenda published on his presidential campaign website. The statement read, “There are over 40 aspirants in both the PDP and the APC combined. Yet, only one of them, Dr Abubakar Saraki, has published his social contract with Nigerians. “Only Dr Saraki is telling both the delegates in our party, the PDP, and Nigerians across the country what he wants to do for them when he assumes office. “This level of preparation and foresight is unprecedented in Nigeria’s recent history, and it demonstrates Dr Saraki’s commitment to actually fixing the problems that Nigeria currently faces,” Onemola said. He stated that Saraki’s five-point plan, which covers the economy, security, restructuring, the rule of law, and national planning, sets out the critical policies that can unlock and actualises the aspirations of all Nigerians.” “With the deliberate nature of this campaign and Dr Saraki’s focus on real solutions, once Nigerians see the plans that a President Saraki administration will embark on, it will become even clearer that he is the most experienced and most prepared candidate,” he added.
