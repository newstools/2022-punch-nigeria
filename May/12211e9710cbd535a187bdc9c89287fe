The Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, has revealed that he had other plans should he fail to clinch the Peoples Democratic Party Presidential ticket. Mohammed made this revelation when he visited the PDP secretariat in Minna to solicit support from delegates ahead of the party’s primaries. The governor stated that despite being a first term governor and contesting the presidential primaries in his party, he also had other plans. “Is there anything wrong with Plan B or Plan C in politics? I am a general. I always plan for the best. “I have plans B for my directors-general, my party people and including you journalists,” he said. Mohammed added that as a democrat, irrespective of the outcome of the primaries, he would obey and accept the party supremacy on its choice of its flag bearer for the 2023 presidential election. “I am a democrat and it is not a do or die affair. I am just presenting myself for the party whose leaders have the discretion to choose whomever they want and must be accepted,” he said. He further stated that zoning was not a problem but a formula to bring devolution of power to ensure equity and justice that was commendable. “Zoning is a provision that will ensure equity and justice and it is under the purview of the party. Wherever it is done, we believe in the supremacy of the party, we believe zoning can only reinforce us and we believe that if it is done by the party, we will accept it wherever it falls,” Mohammed said.
