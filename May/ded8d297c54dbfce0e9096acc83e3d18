FORMER Super Eagles head coach, Gernot Rohr, has revealed he has been contacted by Mali’s federation to take charge of their national team, Les Aigles, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Mali parted ways with Mohamed Magassouba and all of his staff after Les Aigles failed to qualify for the Qatar 2022 World Cup despite their strong pool of talents and immediately several coaches were linked with the job, with Rohr emerging as the top contender. The Franco-German was relieved of his job by the Nigeria Football Federation in December 2021 following some underwhelming performances by the three-time African champions. With the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers set to begin, officials of FEMAFOOT are in search of a coach, with Mali paired in Group C with Congo, Gambia, and South Sudan. Former Mali international, Eric Chelle, and Djibril Drame, have also been linked with the job. Rohr, Nigeria’s longest-serving coach, in an interview with Europe 1 TV, confirmed that he could be the Eagles’ next coach having been without a job since he was sacked by the NFF. “Yes, they (Mali) contacted me indeed,” Rohr said. “It’s a good team, which made (had) an unfortunate CAN (AFCON) and which is also eliminated from the World Cup. I saw the two play-offs against Tunisia; they could have qualified. “They have very good players; it’s an interesting team. The verdict of Fémafoot is expected in the coming days.” During his time with Nigeria, Rohr led the Eagles to qualify for the 2018 World Cup and a third-place finish at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.
