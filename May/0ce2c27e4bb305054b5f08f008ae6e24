The Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Uzor-Kalu, has condemned the kidnapping of the Prelate of the Methodist Church Nigeria, Rev Samuel Kanu-Uche, on Sunday in Abia State. Kalu, in a statement on Monday, lamented that the growing insecurity in the South East was becoming everyday sad news. He called on the governors of Abia and Imo States to intensify security in their Neighboring towns so as to contain the criminal elements around both states. “The two governors should also make efforts to rebuild the Ihube -Okigwe -Uturu roads because those routes have become the den of criminals. “The governors should make efforts to ensure that the Prelate is rescued alongside the two other clergymen with him and to also get the people behind this dastardly act arrested”, he stated. The prelate was abducted on Sunday along Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway, in Umunneochi Local Government Area of Abia state, alongside Rt. Rev. Dennis Mark, the Methodist Bishop of Owerri and the Prelate’s Chaplain, by gunmen. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
