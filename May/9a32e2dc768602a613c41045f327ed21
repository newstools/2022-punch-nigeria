Popular comedian and activist, Debo Adedayo, popularly known as Mr Macaroni, has condemned the beheading of a member of the Anambra State House of Assembly, Dr Okechukwu Okoye. In a tweet on Sunday, the comedian described the act as “most disturbing and inhumane.” The PUNCH had earlier reported that the lawmaker, popularly known as “Okey Di Okay” was earlier kidnapped last Sunday before he was beheaded. Until his unfortunate kidnap and death, Okoye was representing the Aguata North constituency, the same community as the governor of the state, Chukwuma Soludo. Soludo, who confirmed his kidnap on Thursday, during the presentation of the 2022 revised budget to the state House of Assembly, regretted his abduction and assured that the lawmaker would be rescued soon as security agencies were working round the clock to ensure his release. But his freshly beheaded head was mounted at the Chisco Park in Amichi community, Anambra State on Saturday. In a viral video circulating online, the severed head was seen placed in a carton by the roadside with a handwritten note placed by the side. Condemning the act, Mr Macaroni said, “A most disturbing and inhumane act!! The head of a serving Anambra lawmaker, Honourable Okechukwu Okoye, was displayed at a Motor Park in Amichi community of Anambra State. What is happening in Nigeria for goodness sake?” The state police spokesman, Tochukwu Ikenga, had last week confirmed the lawmaker’s kidnap, saying the deceased’s black Siena bus, which he was driving before the incident, had been recovered.
