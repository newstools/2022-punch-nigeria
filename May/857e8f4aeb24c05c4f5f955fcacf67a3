Tributes have continued to pour in for late actor, Leo Mezie, who died on Saturday, May 14, 2022, after a protracted battle with a kidney disease. In an interview with Saturday Beats, veteran actor, Chiwetalu Agu, stated that sickness robbed the late actor of being excellent in his career. Agu said, “Leo was one of those who emerged as an actor in the early years of the industry and he planned to be excellent. Unfortunately, sickness came and it was beyond what doctors could handle. We should be able to gather and pay our last respects to him. May his soul rest in peace.” Another actor, Benedict Johnson, said, “Leo was a good guy and a fantastic actor. He was ill for a very long time. He was down with kidney disease. The first time he had that problem, there was a huge contribution for him to undergo surgery and he seemed to come out of it. “However, the issue arose again and contributions were also made. Then, this last one happened, which I witnessed. I visited him last on May 9, 2022, at the Zenith Medical and Kidney Centre, Abuja. He was looking healthy and even walked me to my car. The next day, the surgery was successful. However, some things happened which caused him to develop high blood pressure. He later died on Saturday and his body was taken to Umuahia, Abia State. He fought a good fight but God knows best.” Johnson also dismissed insinuations in some quarters that actors did not rally round the late Mezie. He said, “When an actor dies, the Actors Guild of Nigeria always does something. Even for the actors that have been sick in the past, the AGN rallied round them.”  Copyright PUNCH.
