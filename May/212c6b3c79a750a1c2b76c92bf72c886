Supporters and loyalists went into jubilation on Wednesday night after Vice President Yemi Osinbajo submitted his expression of interest and nomination forms. The same group had purchased the nomination forms for the vice president last Wednesday at the International Conference Centre, Abuja. Osinbajo’s spokesperson, Laolu Akande, had described them in a tweet via his official Twitter handle as “A passionate team of support groups and individual Nigerians from across the country have raised funds to support the purchase of the APC nomination forms for the Vice President’s 2023 presidential bid.” The submission, which was carried out on his behalf by the leadership of The Progressive Project, a support group promoting his presidential aspiration, took place at the National Secretariat of the ruling All Progressives Congress at about 9 pm. Osinbajo, who was represented by the chairman of the TPP, Senator Kabiru Gaya, and Muhammadu Bulkachuwa, submitted the forms to the APC National Organising Secretary, Alhaji Sulaiman Arugungu at the party secretariat.
