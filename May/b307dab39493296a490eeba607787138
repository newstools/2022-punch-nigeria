A former aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, on Sunday, advised the Peoples Democratic Party to field a northern candidate to win the 2023 presidency. In a series of tweets, the socio-political activist said the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), would deliver the North for any Southern candidate in the election. He, however, said PDP may avoid losing if the party by fielding a northern candidate and not a southerner in 2023. He wrote: “Buhari has always had a captive audience of 12 million Northerners. “If PDP fields a Southerner in 2023, his 12 million captive audience will obey Buhari’s command to vote for Tinubu. And he will win. The only way they won’t obey him is if the PDP fields a Northerner!” The PUNCH had reported that PDP disqualified two of the 17 presidential aspirants it screened on Friday. Chairman of the Screening Committee, Senator David Mark, disclosed this to journalists shortly after the conclusion of the exercise at Legacy House, Abuja, at 7pm. He, however, refused to disclose the identities of the disqualified aspirants or the reasons for their disqualification. Mark simply noted that the aspirants did not meet the requirements. The Chairman also affirmed that the report of Friday’s screening will be transmitted to the PDP National Working Committee for consideration tonight. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
