The President of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Francesco Rocca, has called on the general public to show more kindness to one another in the face of global health challenges. The IFRC boss disclosed this in a goodwill message on the agency’s official Facebook page while celebrating the World Red Cross Days annually held on May 8. With this year’s event theme tagged: “Be Human Kind”, members of the Red Cross Society all around the world trooped out en masse to mark the event of the day, spreading the good news of humanitarianism. “We are all living in an extraordinary time. “The ongoing crisis in Ukraine affecting millions; the ever-present threat of COVID-19; the worrying rise in climate-related disasters, from heatwaves in India to the recent deadly flooding in South Africa. “But in the face of so much challenge and hardship, there is a force so powerful that can bond us all and give us the strength to carry on. “It is human kindness. It’s a hug welcoming someone to safety; it’s a hot meal prepared with love for a family that has lost everything. “It’s a teddy bear given to a young girl so she can smile again. “I know that one small act of kindness can change a life; can spark a movement, can change the world, even when times are tough, let’s all be humankind,” Rocca said. He commended the “selfless work of millions of volunteers worldwide”, adding that their daily acts of kindness and humanity would surely keep making a huge difference in people’s lives.
