The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Sunday, in Abuja, said the North-West must not be allowed to relapse into the days when bandits roamed freely and unleashed mayhem on the people. This was as he commended the military for the continued onslaught on terrorist elements in the region, especially Zamfara State, which had been a hotbed of criminal activities. He also urged the armed forces not to show any letup as they continued to achieve positive outcomes based on their current operational trajectory in the North-West. According to a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the president noted that there appears to be relative calm in Zamfara State with situations returning to normal in most parts and the rural communities ready to lead their lives normally again. There had been several security breaches as bandits attacked Damri, Sabongarin Damri, and Kalahe villages in Bakura Local Government Area, and lately, Maradun. The statement titled ‘Armed forces to continue along the current positive trajectory in the North-West, particularly in Zamfara, as President Buhari commends military,’ quoted the President as saying, “We mustn’t allow the return of days when the bandits had a free hand to do as they wished. The rural folk in Zamfara and elsewhere must be allowed to have peace.” He directed that the “momentum that has been developed must be sustained to bring closure to the activities of these murderers.” Copyright PUNCH.
