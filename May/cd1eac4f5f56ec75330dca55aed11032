A private initiative to improve the standard of swimming in the country by Insight Sports Limited has been embraced by the Lagos State Government. According to the CEO, Insight Sports Limited, Idowu Otukoya, the plan is aimed at producing medal winning swimmers for Nigeria, with the target the Brisbane 2032 Olympics. He added that to actualise this, his organisation was planning to organise a week-long train-the-trainers clinic between July 11 and 15 at the Children’s International School, Lekki. Otukoya, a former Lagos State athlete, who represented the state at the National Sports Festival, said, “Insight Sports Limited is out to transform the way sports is viewed and managed by government and individuals at various levels in Nigeria. Our passion cuts across all sports but the emphasis on swimming is based on the disproportionate platforms for talent management and maximisation.” Chad Onken, Director, American Swimming Coaches Association, will conduct the clinic. Chairman of the Lagos State Sports Commission Sola Aiyepeku welcomed the initiative and pledged the readiness of the commission to support Insight Sports Limited. “Idowu’s idea is in line with our plans to train Lagosians to embrace swimming. As a state dominated by water, we need to do away with the phobia for water and that can only be done by embracing swimming.”
