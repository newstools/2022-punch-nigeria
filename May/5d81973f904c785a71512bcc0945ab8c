Super Eagles star Cyriel Dessers has expressed joy over his call-up for Nigeria’s international friendly matches against Mexico and Ecuador in the United States of America. Dessers reacted in a tweet after the team list was released on Wednesday. “We are back, Let’s go!” he tweeted with an eagle and Nigerian flag emoji. The PUNCH had reported that Super Eagles’ First Assistant Coach, Salisu Yusuf has released a list of 30 players, including Captain Ahmed Musa and forward Moses Simon.  The three-time African champions will clash with CONCACAF powerhouse Mexico at the AT & T Stadium in Dallas, State of Texas on Saturday, May 28, before flying to New Jersey to tackle Ecuador at the Red Bull Arena in Harrison on Thursday, June 2.  Yusuf, who is also Head Coach of the CHAN and the U-23 teams, has included eight home-based professional players, including goalkeepers Adewale Adeyinka and Ojo Olorunleke, defender Ibrahim Buhari, and forwards Victor Mbaoma and Ishaq Rafiu.  Only 25 players will make the final list for the tour, which is preparatory to next month’s 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying matches against Sierra Leone in Abuja (June 9) and São Tomé & Príncipe in Marrakech, Morocco (June 13).
