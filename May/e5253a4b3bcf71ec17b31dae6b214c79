The Lagos State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board has said it will return the Hajj fares paid by intending pilgrims since 2019 in view of the recent increase in fees by the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria. This was as the state pointed out that the present situation was beyond its control. A statement signed by the Board Secretary, Mr. AbdulHakeem Kosoko, and the Commissioner for Home Affairs, Prince Anofiu Elegushi, said the decision for the refund was made after the increment. The statement said, “The intending pilgrims eligible for a refund include those who have already paid the initial deposit of N1.3m since 2019 and those who are exempted by the 65 years age limit as prescribed by the Saudi Arabian authority. “All interested intending pilgrims are requested to write a letter of refund addressed to the Secretary, Lagos State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board, and submit same between Tuesday, 10th and Friday, 13th May 2022, for processing.” Copyright PUNCH.
