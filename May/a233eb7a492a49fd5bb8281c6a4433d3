A presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, Hayatuddeen Mustapha, has stated that he has the capacity to solve the security challenges bedeviling the country within a short time if elected President. Mustapha, who stated this during a meeting with PDP stakeholders from Bauchi and Yobe states at the Command Guest Inn Bauchi ahead of the party’s primary election, added that all other challenges confronting the country, including unemployment, poverty, will also be resolved without delay. According to him, if the PDP would give him the ticket, he would defeat the ruling All Progressives Congress at the poll because he had the capacity. Mustapha promised that if elected as the next Nigerian President, he would work towards addressing challenges of security, economy and other sectors of national economy. He said, “I am here in Bauchi for a national campaign tour to seek the support of delegates of Bauchi, Yobe and Gombe states and the essence is that as PDP presidential aspirant, there is a need for me to have an interaction with them and to tell them that I have the credentials to be able to run for president and win. “Nigerians should expect me to resolve very quickly, the huge national security problems that are confronting the country, revive the dysfunctional economy and to do the needful to reduce unemployment rate and eradicate poverty.” He described his engagement with the PDP delegates in all the states he had so far visited as fruitful. He promised to make a huge difference for the advancement of the country if given the opportunity.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
