There is palpable tension in the Oloko community in the Tai Local Government Area of Rivers State following the alleged killing of a pastor by a suspected member of a vigilance group. It was gathered that the deceased, identified as Abraham Yorka, was allegedly killed by the vigilante who hailed from a neighbouring community in the Oyigbo LGA of the state. A resident in the Oloko community, who identified himself as Monday, explained that some men from his community had gone out to eat after working on farmland in a boundary between Oloko and Afam in Oyigbo. He said on their way back, they suddenly heard shouts from women and children accompanied by gunshots on Thursday. Monday disclosed the men also saw houses being burnt by some gunmen who shot indiscriminately. He said the pastor was hit by one of the bullets. Another resident, Sunday Vasighe, who claimed that he sustained gunshot injuries in his leg and hand, alleged that the gunmen who shot him were vigilantes from the neighbouring community. Vasighe, therefore, called on the Rivers State Government to bring the perpetrators, adding that the incident had been reported at the Koroma-Tai Police Division in the Tai Local Government Area. But the acting spokesperson of the state police command, Grace Iringe-Koko, told our correspondent on Saturday that she had yet to receive a report on the incident. Copyright PUNCH.
