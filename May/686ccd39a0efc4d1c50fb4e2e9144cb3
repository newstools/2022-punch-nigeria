The spokesperson for Tambuwal Campaign Organisation, Prince Daniel, has given reasons Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State stepped down for a former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, during the Peoples Democratic Party presidential primary on Saturday. The PUNCH had reported that after Tambuwal stepped down, Atiku won the contest by polling 371 votes to defeat his close contender, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, who polled 237 votes. Daniel, in a statement on Monday, said Tambuwal stepped down as a result of his patriotism for Nigeria’s development. Part of the statement read, “Tabuwal’s decision to withdraw from the race even though he was most favoured to clinch the ticket was borne out of deep love for Nigeria and the party in particular. “To our teeming supporters, we want you to know that we took this decision with patriotism at heart, putting our dear country Nigeria and our party the PDP ahead of our personal aspiration which we reiterated was inferior to the interest of the nation. “However, to ensure victory at the polls as the PDP prepares to defeat the APC in the forthcoming general elections come February 2023, he urges the Wazirin Adamawa to run an inclusive campaign that will unite the party and the country. “His Excellency also wishes to sincerely thank the Chairman of his campaign council for exemplary leadership, the entire team and all Delegates as well as his teeming supporters across the country for their unrelenting support before, during and after the convention. “He prays for God’s guidance and victory for the PDP as the party goes to work to rescue Nigeria from years of misgovernance by the APC led administration.” Copyright PUNCH.
