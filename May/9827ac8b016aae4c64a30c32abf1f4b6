The Peoples Democratic Party in Abia late Thursday, refuted the media report that there was an alleged siege on its Adelabu Street Headquarters by the police. In a media chat with the party Publicity Secretary, Fabian Nwankwo, he said, “Such a thing never happened. It is not true”. Nwankwo said he was at the office Thursday morning, stating that the police were on their routine work. Confirming the issue, some plain cloth security agents confirmed that no such thing happened. People living and doing business around the area similarly confirmed the party position. It would be recalled in an early morning Government Special Announcement, Abia state government had declared Thursday a public holiday to enable Abians to do voter registration. The Secretary to the State Government, Chris Ezem, said, “Sequel to extensive review of the ongoing voters registration exercise in the state which revealed lower than expected public participation, government hereby declares Thursday, 5th May, 2022 a public holiday to enable those who are yet to take part in the exercise to do the needful in fulfilment of their civic rights and responsibilities. “To this end, all markets, schools, government and other public offices are to be closed to ensure full participation”. This, the security agent said, was the reason nobody was seen at the office and urged the people to disregard the report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
