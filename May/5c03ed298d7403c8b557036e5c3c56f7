Nollywood actress, Laide Bakare, has acquired two luxury cars; a Toyota and a Lexus, few weeks after she “opened” her new house. On her Instagram page on Tuesday, she stated that she had decided to pamper herself for years of hard work. Bakare noted that she wasn’t showing off but was using the opportunity to encourage other ladies that they can achieve their goals. She said, “There comes a time in every girl’s life when she decides to pamper herself extravagantly to compensate for years of hard work and labor. “Having saved for years to acquire more luxurious houses and vehicles, it is save for me to say that persistence is the basic key to glorious success. “Little by little, then here I am today; just few weeks after my new house opening. I give you all the praise, Ya Allah. “Please note, this is not a show off, but to further encourage ladies out there that its acheiveable. You can be successful on your own without depending on anybody in life. “Huge congratulations to me, Alhaja Shakirat Olaide Bakare. Everything is double double. I deliberately chose these two colors, to match my new house painting.” See photos below:   Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
