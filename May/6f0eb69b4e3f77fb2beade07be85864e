The National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools has called on the Federal Government to ensure children are properly protected in various schools around the country. The president of the association, Chief Yomi Otubela, made this known on Friday, in his Children’s Day address. In a copy of the address made available to The PUNCH, Otubela stated that government security operatives should collaborate with the internal security arrangements in schools for effective monitoring. He said, “I must admit that in the last few years, Nigerian children have had a fair share of the insecurity challenges that have continued to ravage the country. This has manifested in form of kidnappings, killings, raping etc in schools. “I, therefore, urge both the states and the Federal Government to ensure that our children are properly protected in our various schools to go about their academics safely. This calls for government security operatives to collaborate with the internal security arrangements in schools for effective monitoring around schools. “However, we do not doubt the ongoing concerted efforts of the Federal Government and state governments through our security apparatus to stem the tide of insecurity. We believe that more efforts and consistency on the part of the government as regards insecurity will eventually yield a positive outcome. “Governments at various levels should take it further by creating an environment where children will not only feel safe and happy to learn but also support their mental well-being.” Copyright PUNCH.
