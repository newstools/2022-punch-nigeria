The Federal High Court sitting in Ilorin, Kwara State, has convicted and sentenced a 19-year-old undergraduate, Oyedotun Adebowale, to two years’ imprisonment for cyber fraud. The Ilorin Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, which prosecuted Adebowale for Internet fraud, told the court that N21m was found in the bank account of the Kwara State Polytechnic undergraduate. According to the EFCC, Adebowale was prosecuted on one count before Justice Muhammed Sani of the Federal High Court sitting in Ilorin. The judge found him guilty of the charge and sentenced him to two years’ imprisonment with a fine option of N300,000. “Investigations had earlier revealed that Oyedotun had under his possession over N21m suspected to be proceeds of unlawful activities and a Toyota Camry, which he purchased using his mother’s name,” the EFCC said. Upon arraignment, he pleaded guilty to the charge. Counsel for the EFCC, Sesan Ola, reviewed the facts of the case and tendered the extra-judicial statements of the defendant, iPhone 12 Promax, the key and particulars of a Toyota Camry recovered from him, and a draft of N350,000 which were admitted in evidence. The counsel urged the court to take judicial notice of the unchallenged evidence placed before it as well as the provisions of the law to convict the defendant as charged. Justice Sani held that the prosecution had established its case against the defendant. In sentencing the convict, the judge ordered that all items recovered from him be forfeited to the Federal Government. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
