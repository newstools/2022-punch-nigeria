Cisse revealed that the first time an ultrasound scan was done, it showed that they would have twins. Subsequent scans, however, showed three and four babies respectively. After his wife was delivered and he was informed of the birth of his quadruplets, he told his friends who were with him that he wanted to get something outside but they suspected he wanted to run away, so, they trailed him.
