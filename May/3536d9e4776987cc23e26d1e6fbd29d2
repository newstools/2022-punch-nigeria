One Alex Peter, 20, on Wednesday, appeared before an Osun State Magistrates Court, sitting in Osogbo for stealing food items. The defendant, who was docked on two counts of felony and stealing, allegedly committed the crime on Tuesday, at about 5:00pm at the Oroki Housing Extension, Osogbo. Addressing the court, the prosecutor, Abiodun Fagboyinbo, said the defendant stole four tins of Three Crown milk, six pieces of spaghetti Golden Penny, 10 cups of beans, a pack of Gino seasoning, a bag of Semovita, all valued at N6,800 at the shop of one Ronke Adesiyan. Fagboyinbo said the offences committed were contrary to and punishable under Sections 516 and 390(9) of the Criminal Code Cap 34 Vol. II laws of Osun State, Nigeria 2002. The defendant pleaded guilty and when asked how he got to the state, Peter said he had come to Osogbo from Ore, Ondo State to see his sister, but he could not reach her through phone, as the number was switched off, when he arrived and he did not have her address. He admitted approaching Adesiyan’s shop where he met her children when he was hungry, insisting that he did not steal the items. But Adesiyan told the court that after the defendant had obtained all the items he wanted, he refused to pay and wanted to flee. She, however, urged the court to pardon him. In his ruling, the presiding Magistrate, A. Adeyeba, struck out the case but warned the defendant against illegal acts.
