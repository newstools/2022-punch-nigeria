The former Director-General, Media and Communications to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, Salihu Yakasai, has declared his intention to contest the Kano State gubernatorial election on the platform of the People’s Redemption Party in 2023. Recall that Yakasai recently announced his defection from the ruling All Progressives Congress to the PRP after he parted ways with his principal. Yakasai made the declaration to run for governor while addressing hundreds of party supporters at the Mambayya House in Kano on Friday. He said his decision to join the governorship race was borne out of his commitment and desire to ‘place the state on the path of prosperity.’ He added that Kano needed a vibrant and ambitious leader who could put the state on a prosperous path. He said, “In 2023, Kano needs a vibrant and ambitious leader; one who does not see any boundaries when it comes to the heights we can attain. One who understands the peculiarities of the state and is deeply immersed in it. “It is against this background that, after careful consideration, I humbly present myself to the great people of this beautiful state, for consideration for the position of Governor, on the platform of our great party, the Peoples Redemption Party. “The reason I decided to accept the yearnings of many Kanawa, and contest for the highest office in the state is simply because I want to ensure our democratic system is rooted in democratic humanism, which simply means giving power back to the people, to shape their own lives, and build their future.” Copyright PUNCH.
