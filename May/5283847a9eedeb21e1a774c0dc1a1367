Nollywood actress, Omoni Oboli, says her sons’ girlfriends or wives will be shocked by her actions if they hurt them in their relationship. Oboli, who made the statement in an Instagram post on Tuesday, said men were also victims of domestic violence, adding that some women, while in a relationship with their male lovers, usually subjected them to hurtful experiences. The proud mother of three boys described herself as a sweet person whom her sons’ girlfriends or wives would immensely enjoy. She, however, noted that if any girlfriend or wife made an attempt to hurt her sons, they would be shocked by her action. The post read, “Men are going through a lot too! Some women are witches! I’m a mom of boys. I’m the sweetest person. My sons’ girlfriends and wives will enjoy me immensely but if you try to hurt my son, my sister in the lord! You will see a LION! E go shock you. #NoToDomesticViolence #GenderBasedViolence.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
