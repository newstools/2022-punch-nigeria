A yet-to-be-identified man, who allegedly jumped into a compound to steal, has killed a landlord who caught him in the act in Akpanaka Phase 2, Ogbogoro, in the Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State. The Chairman of Akpanaka Phase 2, Wordu Onyeche, who narrated the incident to journalists on Thursday, said the suspect was caught by vigilantes in the community. “After he jumped into the compound, the man (landlord) asked who he was. That was when he shot the owner of the house. “When the man was escaping, he stepped on a nail and started bleeding. He attempted jumping the fence into another compound, but the blood followed him. “Then he ran into a small bush and came with two abokis (Northerners). Then he went inside and lay down. “OSPAC came and traced the blood till they got to where the abokis lived. When they got there, the door was locked. They had to force the door open. “The man was lying down as if he didn’t know what was happening. After they caught him, they pulled up a mattress and found one AK-47,” he added. Onyeche said the suspect confessed to the crime and was taken to the State Criminal Investigation Department. The acting spokesperson for the state police command, Grace Iringe-Koko, confirmed the incident, adding that investigation was ongoing. “We (police) are aware that someone was shot and we are investigating to know what happened and the identity of the person,” Iringe-Koko stated.
