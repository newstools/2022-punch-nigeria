The Supreme Court has upheld the Governor Abdullahi Ganduje-led faction of the All Progressives Congress in Kano State. The apex court, in a lead judgment delivered by Justice Inyang Okoro on Friday, held that the appeal against the earlier judgments of the Court of Appeal in Abuja lacked merit. The court invalidated the former governor Ibrahim Shekarau-led faction. The earlier appeals followed two rulings of an FCT High Court, which upheld ward and local government congresses won by the faction loyal to Shekarau and Senator Jubril Barau (Kano North),whose members number about 17,908 and 1,319 members, respectively. Recall that the two factions had held parallel congresses and produced two sets of state executives on October 18, 2021. The faction of the APC loyal Shekarau had been in a leadership battle with the Ganduje’s group. While Ganduje’s group produced Abdullahi Abbas as state chairman, Shekarau’s camp elected Haruna Danzago to the same position. The News Agency of Nigeria reported that an Abuja High Court voided the congresses following a challenge in the suit filed by a group led by Shekarau. The national leadership of the party, however, recognised the congresses of the Ganduje group, leading to the other faction heading to the court. The Ganduje faction had filed the motions following it appeal regarding the matter. The faction subsequently transmitted the records of appeal to the Court of Appeal.
