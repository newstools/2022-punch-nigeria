Boston Consulting Group Nigeria, Recyclan, and HB Imagino, have carried out a joint beach clean-up exercise to reduce the level of plastic waste pollution and create jobs for women in the sorting and plastic waste collection process. BCG said the exercise was to raise awareness of the environmental, health, and climate impact of improper waste disposal in drainages, rivers, seas, and oceans. The exercise was carried out at Oniru Beach, Lagos. In a statement, the firm added that the exercise was held in commemoration of the World Health Day, and in line with its climate action and social impact mandate. Partner and Head of BCG Nigeria, Tolu Oyekan, said, “We are deeply concerned about the increasing rate of pollution of our water bodies as these wastes contain dangerous chemicals that find their way to the global food chain.”  Copyright PUNCH.
