General Overseer of Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has called for the containment of malaria saying it was more deadly than COVID-19. According to him, based on a newspaper report, no less than 200,000 people were reported dead as a result of malaria, adding that despite the disruption caused by COVID-19 the causality was less than 200,000. He spoke while delivering a sermon, titled, ‘Supernatural Elevation’, during the monthly Thanksgiving Service at the National Headquarters of the church at Ebute Meta, Lagos. Adeboye explained that he had just returned from the Europe Convention of the RCCG, involving members from European countries, adding that those with face masks might not have been up to two. He said, “I just returned from our European convention, I’m not sure I saw up to two people wearing masks. I read in the newspaper that 200,00 people died from malaria; Coronavirus is less than 200,000. Which one is more deadly, is it ‘Coro’ or Malaria?” He lamented the increase of persons who took delight in staying away from church with coronavirus as an excuse, saying that he had prophesied that it would subside and not go away. “Any young person staying away from church is disobeying God. Anyone older than I, is old and anyone younger than I, is young. If you want to wear a facemask, fine. God told me coronavirus will subside but it will not go away. Safety is of the lord, stop fearing the devil,” Adeboye said. Adeboye who delivered the message, Supernatural Elevation, cited the examples of Joseph and David as some of the individuals that were, “reaching a height that can’t be reached by natural means.” Copyright PUNCH.
