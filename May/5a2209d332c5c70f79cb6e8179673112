Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen, has been named the Best Young Player of the 2021/22 outgoing Serie A season, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The Napoli striker beat Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic, Leao of AC Milan and Sassuolo’s duo Gianluca Scamacca and Giacomo Raspadori to the prestigious award despite scoring fewer goals than the trio. The Nigeria international scored 14 goals and made five assists in just 26 Serie A appearances this season. Vlahovic scored 24 goals in 35 games for both Fiorentina and Juventus, while Scamacca has scored 16 times in 35 games for Sassuolo. AC Milan’s Mike Maignan was named the Most Valuable goalkeeper in the Italian topflight division while Gleison Bremer won the award for the best defender. Inter Milan’s midfielder, Marcelo Brozovic (Inter) and striker Ciro Immobile (Lazio) both won awards for the best midfielder and striker in the Serie A. Osimhen rarely featured for Napoli this season due to injury problems, specifically multiple facial fractures he sustained during a nasty clash of heads with Inter defender Milan Skriniar in November 2021. That ruled the hitman out until January and he still wears a protective mask. Osimhen is only in his second year in Italy, joining Napoli in 2020. He joined Napoli from Lille for a club and African record fee of €81.3m still has three years left on his contract in Naples, but he has been linked with a move away from the club. Premier League clubs like Arsenal, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle are reportedly leading the race to sign the Nigerian. The 23-year-old will be aiming to add to his tally when the Partenopei takes on Spezia in their final league game of the season on Sunday.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
