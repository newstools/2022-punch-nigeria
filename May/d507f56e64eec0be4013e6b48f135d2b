The Chairman of the House of Representatives’ Committee on Appropriations, Aliyu Betara, has emerged the consensus candidate of the All Progressives Congress for the Biu/Bayo/Kwaya/Kusar/Shani Federal Constituency in Borno State. Betara, whose Nomination and Declaration of Interest forms were procured by the APC leaders and members in his constituency for N10m, is coming back to the House for the fifth term unopposed. In his acceptance speech, the lawmaker thanked his constituents for the show of love. Betara said, “I am happy my people want me back because I am always on the ground for them. This has shown how much they appreciate my efforts and I will keep doing more for them. I want to use this medium to thank everyone for believing in me. Together, we will work to achieve goals for the good of our constituents.” A delegation of leaders and loyalists from the constituency, led by a former Deputy Governor of Borno State, Adamu Yuguda, had tipped Betara for speaker of the House while picking the forms for him earlier in April. A member of the delegation, Mustapha Mohammed, said, “I think he has the right to aspire to any position in this country. So, we are in support of his attaining the position of speakership in the National Assembly because he has the experience and the capacity, and he has demonstrated it. His colleagues can testify to that and we are fully behind him to attempt any position of authority in this country.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
