Former Edo State Governor, Adams Oshiomhole, on Thursday held a closed-door meeting with the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Abdullahi Adamu, at the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja. The development came two days after the former APC national chairman traded words with APC presidential aspirant and Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi over rigging allegation. After the meeting ended, the 2023 senatorial aspirant avoided granting audience to expectant journalists and drove out of the secretariat. Although there was no official statement from the APC secretariat over the purpose of his visit, speculations were rife that the meeting may not be unconnected to last Sunday’s screening of senatorial aspirants or Oshiomhole’s recent attack on Fayemi. Oshiomhole, in a television interview, had accused Fayemi of asking him to rig the election during his tenure as APC chairman. Reacting to the allegation, Fayemi, had on Tuesday faulted the rigging allegations by Oshiomhole and a former State Attorney General and Social Democratic Party chieftain, Owoseeni Ajayi, saying they were an attempt to tarnish his image. In a statement released by his Chief Press Secretary, Olayinka Oyebode, the Ekiti governor disclosed that he remains steadfast in pursuing his aspiration to get the APC ticket for the 2023 presidential election. This is even as he vowed that no amount of mudslinging from disenchanted individuals like Oshiomhole would distract or discourage him. “For the avoidance of doubt, Governor Fayemi has no reason to approach Comrade Oshiomhole for favours for any election. Fayemi has a stellar track record of being a consummate democrat even in difficult times,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
