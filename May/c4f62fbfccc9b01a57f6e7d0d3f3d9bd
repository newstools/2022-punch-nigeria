The Nigerian Communications Commission has said there would be no tariff increase for calls and short messaging services by the telecommunication companies without cost-based and empirical studies and regulatory approval. The NCC, in a statement on Friday by its Director of Public Affairs, Ikechukwu Adinde, said it received a letter from mobile network operators to increase tariffs for voice and short messaging services by a certain percentage, but the request was declined. The NCC said, “For the avoidance of any doubt, and contrary to MNOs’ agitation to increase tariffs for voice and Short Messaging Services by a certain percentage, the commission wishes to categorically inform telecoms subscribers and allay the fears of Nigerians that no tariff increase will be effected by the operators without due regulatory approval by the commission.” The NCC further said although there may be a justifiable reason for the tariff hike, the mobile network operators could not increase the cost without due approval from the commission. It added, “It is noteworthy that tariff regulations and determinations are made by the commission in line with the provisions of Sections 4, 90 and 92 of the Nigerian Communications Act 2003, which entrusts the commission with the protection and promotion of the interests of subscribers against unfair practices, including but not limited to, matters relating to tariffs and charges.”  Copyright PUNCH.
