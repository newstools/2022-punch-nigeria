Wife of the president, Aisha Buhari; Minister of Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen and Wife of the Vice President, Dolapo Osinbajo on Monday breezed into the national secretariat of the All Progressives Congress. The embattled minister has been in the news lately after she dropped her senatorial ambition a week after she purchased the APC form to contest the Plateau South Senatorial election. The trio was warmly received by the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, who subsequently ushered them in for a closed-door meeting. When asked for the purpose of their visit, the First Lady disclosed that they were on a solidarity visit to congratulate the APC leadership for being honoured with the privilege to lead the party. She said, “We are here to congratulate the national chairman for the opportunity God has given him to lead this great party and to thank him for the good work he has started. Finally, we are encouraging him not to forget women in all elective positions,” she said. Tallen also emphasised that women’s role is critical in national development and all elective positions. The minister, however, declined to comment on why she suddenly dropped her senatorial ambition and the president’s stand on the issue. Critics, however, believe there could be more to the lame congratulatory visit than meet the eye Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
