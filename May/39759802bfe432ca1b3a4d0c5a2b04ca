Super Falcons forward, Asisat Oshoala, was on target in Barcelona Femini’s 5-1 thrashing of Sevilla in the Women’s Spanish Primera Division on Thursday for their 28th victory of the season. Another Falcons star Toni Payne scored the opener to put Sevilla in front in the 40th minute as the visitors took a 1-0 lead into half time. Barca returned from the dressing room a more determined side, scoring five second half goals to annihilate Sevilla, who were hoping to hand their hosts their first loss of the season. Claudia Pina scored the equaliser in the 58th minute, while Oshoala scored in the 60th minute to put the hosts in front for the first time in the game. Alexia Putellas made it 3-1 in the 74th minute and Mariona Caldentey scored Barcelona’s fourth 14 minutes later. Substitute Jennifer Hermoso ensured her name was also on the score sheet when she beat Sevilla’s goalkeeper to score Barca’s fifth in the 90th minute. It was Oshoala’s first goal since February 13, when they thumped Atletico Madrid 3-0. Payne was in action for 77 minutes before coming off for Debora Garcia, while Oshoala earlier made way for Hermoso in the 71st minute.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
