Gunshots amid protests on Wednesday morning rocked the All Progressives Congress secretariat along Woji Road, GRA, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, during screening. Hundreds of the APC members loyal to a former federal lawmaker, Senator Magnus Abe, thronged the premises, alleging hijack of state assembly aspirants screening and ward/state delegate selection. The aggrieved party members said they arrived at the secretariat around 6:00 am only to meet the gate under lock and key. But, trouble started when some of the youths attempted to force open the gates which prompted the policemen stationed inside the party secretariat to shoot into the air. The shooting caused pandemonium in the area as journalists covering the protesters and newsmen covering the event scampered for safety. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
