The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, on Friday, released on bail a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mrs Patricia Etteh. The anti-graft agency had on Tuesday arrested Etteh over alleged N287m solar-power electrification project scam in Akwa-Ibom State. An investigator of the EFCC told our correspondent on Friday that the ex-Speaker was released on administrative bail. The investigator, who spoke anonymously, added that Etteh could be called in for further questioning any time. The EFCC said the electrification project was awarded by the Niger Delta Development Commission to Phil Jin Projects Ltd in 2011. The agency said it was probing an alleged payment of N130m into Etteh’s bank account by the contractor. “What happened was that in 2011, the NDDC awarded a contract of N240m to Phil Jin Project Limited for the supply of solar-powered streetlights in some communities in Akwa Ibom. “Shortly after the contract was awarded, the firm got N34m as an initial sum. Two weeks later, they received N253m, a total of N287m. Although, the contract itself was worth N240m. “Etteh is not a director in the company or a contractor. But the company paid her N130m. So, she was invited to explain what the money was for and she has been unable to do so. It is either the company is fronting for her or there are some shady deals. We cannot ascertain the execution of the contract in any case.” Meanwhile, the EFCC source said the Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, who was also arrested during the week for alleged N80bn fraud, was still being grilled in the custody of the EFCC.
