The Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra has demanded the immediate release of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, from detention. This is as the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), begins a two-day visit to Ebonyi State on Thursday. The group equally called for a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction in 2023. MASSOB’s demands were contained in a statement by its leader, Uchenna Madu, on Wednesday. The PUNCH reports that Kanu was arrested in 2021 and charged to court on allegations of terrorism and treasonable felony and denied the charges. MASSOB and IPOB are seeking the secession of Biafra from Nigeria. While noting that MASSOB was not against the president’s visit to the region, it said Kanu’s release would douse tension in the region. It said, “As President Muhammadu Buhari visits Ebonyi State, MASSOB reminds Mr. President that only the release of IPOB leader will douse tension in the zone and restore a peaceful atmosphere to the entire country.” Copyright PUNCH.
