The families of passengers kidnapped from the bombed Abuja-Kaduna took to the streets of Kaduna on Wednesday to call for the rescue of their loved ones from the kidnappers’ den. With placards, the protesters called on the Federal Government to ensure the safe release of their family members. Terrorists had attacked the train on March 28, leading to the death of no fewer than eight persons, 26 persons injured and several persons were abducted.
