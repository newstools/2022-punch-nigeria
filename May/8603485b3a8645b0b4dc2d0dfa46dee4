AN online learning platform Your Study Path, has created an application that boasts of high-quality educational videos and learning materials for students preparing for the West African Senior School Certificate Examination and Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination. Your Study Path Co-founder Daniel Egunjobi, explained that the platform did not aim at eliminating school but supporting it. A statement by the organisation said, “Your Study Path wants to make education fun and accessible to the everyday Nigerian student. To this end, they have created high-quality, engaging educational videos delivered by experts on internet-based devices. With real-time feedback and quick buffering speed, they have created a product that allows learners to learn with the appropriate guidance and without concerns about internet limitations.” Speaking on the idea behind the product, he noted that the program doesn’t intend to eliminate school but supports it. “Our driving question is why should a student spend six years preparing for WASSCE and UTME and still fail it?” he said. Innocent Usigbe, co-founder and creative director, explained that the ultimate goal was for it to be the largest learning ecosystem where anyone could learn about anything in a fun, interesting and affordable manner. “This is undoubtedly good news for the millions of Nigerian school children who are either out of school or are not learning enough. “Every business I have built has been to make ends meet. But this is one thing I’m doing that’s beyond making ends meet. It’s personal and it’s all about changing people’s lives,” he concluded.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
