Bandits have attacked two villages in the Bakura Local Government Area of Zamfara State, Killing at least 56 people with several others injured. Speaking to Sunday PUNCH on phone, a resident of the area, Samaila Mohammed, said the bandits, who were on motorcycles and carrying sophisticated weapons, invaded Sabon-garin Damri and Kalahe villages on Friday, opening fire on everyone on sight. Mohammed said, “The bandits, who were riding over 100 motorcycles with each motorcycle carrying three persons, attacked our village Sabon-garin Damri immediately after the Friday prayers and started shooting sporadically, killing many people.” He said the bandits also moved to Kalahe village where they launched another attack, killing many people. According to him, 56 dead bodies were recovered from Sabon-garin Damri and Kalahe villages on Saturday after the attack. “We have counted 56 dead bodies today (Saturday) and there are several others who sustained severe injuries.” Mohammed added that the bandits also carted away foodstuffs and many domestic animals. Frantic efforts were made to get comments from the spokesperson for the state police command, SP Mohammed Shehu, but his phone numbers did not connect.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
