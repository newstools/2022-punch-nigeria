A petroleum-laden tanker was on Friday gutted by fire at the Agbarho community section of the East-West road in Delta State. The PUNCH gathered that the incident happened when the tanker veered off the road and fell. It was gathered that the tanker immediately caught fire. Sources said that travellers along the highway had a hectic time they were stranded for several hours following restrictions on vehicular movement on the road. However, operatives of the State Fire Service later moved to the scene and subsequently put out the inferno. Although the incident was described as destructive, it could not be ascertained if there was any casualty. The Police Public Relations Officer for Delta State Command, Bright Edafe, also could not be reached for comments on the incident as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH.
