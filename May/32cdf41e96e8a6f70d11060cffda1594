Governor of Cross River State, Prof Ben Ayade, has submitted his presidential nomination and expression of intention forms at the All Progressives Congress National Secretariat in Abuja. According to the Special Adviser Media and Publicity to Ayade, Christian Ita, the submission, which took place at the office of the National Organising Secretary of the party, was done on behalf of Ayade by Alphonsus Eba, the Cross River State Chairman of the APC. He said Eba eulogised the governor for his achievements in the last seven years, declaring that Nigeria needed Ayade to fix the country. “With near zero allocation, Ayade has been able to do magic in the state. We can boast of over 32 factories, network of roads and world-class infrastructure strategically situated across the state. These great achievements and more will be replicated in Nigeria if Ayade becomes President,” he said.  All rights reserved.
