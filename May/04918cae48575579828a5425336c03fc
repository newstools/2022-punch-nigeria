Moses Simon has been named Nantes’ Player of The Month for April after his impressive form for the Canaries, beating teammates Quentin Merlin, Wylan Cyprien and Kalifa Coulibaly to the award. He takes over from Merlin, who won the award for February and March. The Nigeria international garnered 59.51 per cent of the total votes to emerge the winner. Simon had a productive April scoring three goals and providing one assist in five league games in the month. It is the second time he would scoop the award this season, having been voted the club’s best player in September 2021 after his impressive performance. Simon’s impressive form also saw him named in the league’s Team of The Week for match-day 35, after scoring a brace in his side’s 2-2 draw against 10-man Lens on Sunday. The Nigeria international has had an impressive campaign with the French club this season, scoring six league goals and providing eight assists. He was also nominated for the March Player of The Month award after his impressive display in Nantes victory over champions Paris Saint-Germain. Simon has been instrumental to the club’s form this season and despite missing on one of the European qualification slots, they are in a comfortable position in the league compared to the 2020/21 season, where they remained in the league by virtue of the relegation play-offs.
