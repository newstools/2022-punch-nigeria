A presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has distributed sacks of rice and sugar to over 50,000 families across Nigeria. According to a statement on Sunday, the gesture was in the spirit of charitable giving that accompanies the Ramadan season. “The distribution of these items which began last week, put smiles on the faces of beneficiaries with many expressing thanks through prayers for Asiwaju,” the statement read. Speaking about Ramadan earlier in April, the former Lagos governor emphasised on the need to “contribute to the wellbeing of those around us, give succour to people we find in need and study more how to solve problems instead of creating them.” Copyright PUNCH.
