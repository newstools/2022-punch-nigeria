Turkish Super Lig current champions Trabzonspor have suspended contract negotiations with Nigerian striker Anthony Nwakaeme, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. According to a top journalist in Turkey, Barış Yurduseven, the new champions have told the striker to wait till the end of the season before they begin talks over his future. Nwakaeme has been consistent for the Black Sea Storm since his move from Hapoel Beer Sheva in 2018 and was a huge part of the team’s success this season as the club ended its 38-year wait for the league title, despite missing several games due to injury and coronavirus-related issues. So far this season, the 33-year-old has scored 11 goals and assisted 10 in 27 appearances. In their title chase in the 2021/22 season, he was the club’s second-highest goals scorer with 11 goals, five behind top scorer, Andreas Cornelius, who played seven games more than the Nigerian. Meanwhile, Nwakaeme’s contract will expire at the end of June and could be out of the club following a series of breakdown talks. Trabzonspor are reluctant to meet the player’s financial demands despite their desire to tie him to the club for another two years. According to Trt Spor, the Super Lig champions have decided to stop negotiations till the end of the season. “It is said that Nwakaeme wants €10m money for three years. Trabzonspor management said to Nwakaeme’s manager, “We are suspending the negotiations, see you at the end of the season”. Nwakaeme could play his last game for Trabzonspor when they face Istanbul Basaksehir in the final league game of the season on May 22.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
