Chief Adebayo Adelabu, popularly called Penkelemes, has dumped the All Progressives Congress alongside some other aggrieved party leaders. Adelabu was APC’s governorship candidate in 2019 but lost the 2023 APC governorship ticket to Senator Teslim Folarin in the recently conducted primary. Some Oyo APC leaders and Adelabu announced their defection at Adelabu Campaign Office in Ibadan on Sunday. While speaking, Adelabu vowed to contest the 2023 governorship election and assured his supporters of victory in next year’s election “We shall be successful. We will rescue Oyo State next year. We shall be victorious in 2023,” he said. Folarin, representing Oyo Central Senatorial district, defeated Adelabu by polling 954 votes. Adelabu polled 327 votes to come second in the keenly contested election. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
