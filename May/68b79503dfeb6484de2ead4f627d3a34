The Lagos State Drivers Institute has stressed the need for professional drivers to be trained in specialised skills and modern technology. According to a statement made available to journalists on Monday, the General Manager of LASDRI, Mrs. Afusat Tiamiyu, disclosed this at the opening of a four-day structured training programme for professional drivers of the Lagos State Ambulance Service at the institute’s headquarters in Oshodi. She said, “The four-day structured training is part of efforts at ensuring that all drivers of both private and public organisations are well skilled in specialised driving and up-to-date with modern technology. “The administration of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has invested so much in the capacity building of Lagos State civil servants across all cadres and we urge all participants to imbibe the culture of responsible, responsive and professional ambulance drivers that would be taught during the training exercise.” Responding, LASAMBUS Drivers’ Coordinator, an Assistant Chief Administration and Human Resources Officer, Lagos State Ministry of Health, Mrs Azeezat Ogoma, stated that the drivers were brought to the institute to acquire specialised skills for the protection and maintenance of some newly-acquired ambulance vehicles. “The mobile healthcare service of the Lagos State Ministry of Health deemed it necessary that the drivers be conversant with the modern technology of the ambulances, expecting the trainees to update their driving skills and acquire knowledge to detect vehicular faults,” she said.
