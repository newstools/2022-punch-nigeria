The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has dismissed an exparte application filed by the embattled Peoples Democratic Party governorship aspirant in Rivers State, Farah Dagogo, seeking to stop the party’s governorship primary in the state. The court was said to have based its ruling on the grounds that the application was filed late and the applicant could not induce urgency on the court. Dagogo, a serving lawmaker representing Degema-Bonny Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, who is being detained at the Port Harcourt Correctional Centre, is standing trial on two counts of conspiracy to felony and cultism at the Federal High Court Port Harcourt. He had yet to be granted bail even as he had pleaded not guilty to the charges. The aspirant in a motion on notice filed at the Federal High Court, Abuja, sought an order of interlocutory injunction restraining the PDP from using any list of aspirants without his name to conduct the May 26 primary election pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit. Hon. Dagogo also sought an order restraining the Independent National Electoral Commission from accepting any candidate, who might emerge from the primary election conducted without his participation. The court presided over by Justice Taiwo Taiwo had ordered the PDP and INEC  to show reasons why the PDP’s governorship primary should hold in Rivers without the detained aspirant. Justice Taiwo, who dismissed the application on Wednesday, fixed June 7 for a hearing on the substantive suit. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
