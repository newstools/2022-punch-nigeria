A paramount traditional ruler in Nasarawa state, the Sangarin Shabu, Mahmoud Bwalla, has commended the Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, Shauib Faisal, for his efforts in tackling the coronavirus pandemic in Nigeria. Bwalla stated this in Lafia on Friday during a press briefing in honour of the Executive Director who recently received the productivity Order of Merit Award from the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). While describing the award as well deserved, the traditional ruler said NPHCDA under Dr. Shauib had recorded unprecedented transformation especially in the area of upgrading health care facilities across the country. He also pointed out that the Executive Director had distinguished himself in stamping out Ebola and Polio, and had taken routine immunisation very seriously which had greatly helped citizens of the country. He said, “The productivity order of merit award on Dr Faisal Shauib is indeed well deserved because he has done so well since he emerged as Executive Director of NPHCDA. “I also want to use this opportunity to urge him to redouble his efforts towards reaching the unreached with health care services in order to reduce the rate of maternal and child mortality in the country, to the barest minimum. “And I won’t fail to commend President Muhammadu Buhari for the award because it is an indication that he rewards hard work.” Copyright PUNCH.
