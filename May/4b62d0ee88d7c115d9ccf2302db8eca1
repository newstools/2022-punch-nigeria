Former Vice President and presidential aspirant under the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, has shown gratitude to the Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu  Tambuwal, for stepping down his ambition for him. Atiku, who tweeted via his official Twitter handle, @AtikuAbubakar, noted that he looked forward to working with Tambuwal. “Thank you, H.E @AWTambuwal. Thanks for your spirited campaign. I look forward to working with you as we unite our party and our country.” Saturday PUNCH had earlier reported that Tambuwal had withdrawn his aspiration and had urged his supporters to vote for Atiku. “The time has come to make a sacrifice for the good of the country and the party and also to minimise rancor and jostle for power among Aspirants. I have come to the conclusion to step down from the race. I urge my supporters to vote for Atiku Abubakar,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
