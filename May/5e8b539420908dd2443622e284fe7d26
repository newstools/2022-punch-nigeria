Spain, on Wednesday, detected 59 cases of monkeypox, the government said, adding that it would obtain vaccines and antiviral drugs to stem its spread through a joint European Union procurement deal. A total of 59 people tested positive for the illness via polymerase chain reaction test, of whom 20 were confirmed to have it through genome sequencing, Health Minister Carolina Darias said. In total, 171 suspected cases of monkeypox had been reported nationwide. “Spain also intends to acquire Imvanex smallpox vaccines and Tecovirimat antivirals, usually used to treat the same disease, through an EU joint procurement scheme to try to stall the spread of monkeypox,” Darias said. The European Union’s Health Emergency Response Authority “is going to make the smallpox vaccine available to member states,” she said, adding the doses would be “distributed in an equitable manner between member states.” The World Health Organisation has said that, as of May 22, more than 250 confirmed and suspected cases had been officially reported to the United Nations health agency from 16 countries outside endemic nations in west and central Africa. Monkeypox, which is not usually fatal, can cause a fever, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills, exhaustion, and a chickenpox-like rash on the hands and face. AFP
