French women’s football giants Lyon won the league title for the 15th time on Sunday with a 1-0 victory at rivals Paris Saint-Germain. Catarina Macario scored the only goal after three minutes, securing an eight-point lead for Lyon over PSG with one game to play, just over a week after winning the Champions League. PSG upset Lyon last season to claim their first title and end the south-eastern side’s 14-year reign. But Lyon quickly bounced back to complete the double with an eighth European title after defeating defending champions Barcelona 3-1 in Turin. AFP
