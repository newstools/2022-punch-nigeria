United States-trained medical doctor and presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, Dr Nwachukwu Anakwenze, has said Nigeria needs a new constitution and restructuring to progress as one entity. Anakwenze said if elected President in 2023, he would embark on restructuring the country into a true and balanced federation, with powers properly devolved from the centre to the component regions. He also promised to “utilise modern technology, such as helicopters and armed drones to fight these terrorists.” Anakwenze, who is also Chairman of the Igbo World Assembly, made the promises in Abuja while addressing journalists on his agenda for the country ahead of PDP primaries scheduled for May 28. The aspirant who was initially disqualified by the PDP screening panel, headed by former Senate President, David Mark, also said his disqualification had been upturned and he was back in the race.
