Transportation Minister and presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress, Rotimi Amaechi, said he would resign on Monday. This followed the directive by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), that all his cabinet members seeking elective positions in the 2023 general elections should resign. Amaechi stated this on Sunday in Kaduna where he met the party’s delegates ahead of the APC’s presidential primaries slated for this month. The minister expressed his gratitude for the opportunity given to serve the country. Amaechi, who disclosed that he would be resigning as the Minister of Transportation on Monday, said he was one of the youngest of all the Presidential aspirants in his party, the APC. Amaechi urged other contestants he described as elders to “go home and rest”. He said he governed a state that was ravaged at the time by insecurity but was able to successfully tame the situation and expressed confidence that if elected President, he would do the same in Nigeria. While presenting the Transportation Minister to the delegates, Kaduna State governor, Nasir El-Rufai, who described Amaechi as friend and confidant of the President, said the minister won Buhari’s heart in 2011 when as a Peoples Democratic Party governor of Rivers State, he funded the convention of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change. While reminding the delegates of their endorsement of Tinubu, El-Rufai said, “Many people contesting elections always say delegates will hardly make heaven, because they don’t keep to promise, but I always say Kaduna delegates are different.” Copyright PUNCH.
