A 28-year-old woman, Deborah Omeoha, has been arraigned before a Yaba Magistrates’ Court for allegedly kidnapping a six-year-old girl in the Ebute Meta area of Lagos State. She was arraigned on one count of kidnapping. The charge read, “That you, Deborah Omeoha, on June 21, 2021, at Railwayline, Ebute-Metta, Lagos, in the Yaba Magisterial District, with intent to deprive Mrs Amaka Ogbaga lawful charge and possession of her daughter, Miss Agatha Ogbaga, aged six, by fraudulently taking her to an unknown destination, thereby committing an offence punishable under Section 277 (1) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015”. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge. During the proceedings, the defendant shouted multiple times in the courtroom, saying the woman she gave the baby to was still in police custody. She asked the court why she was the only one brought to trial. The Chief Magistrate, P.E Nwaka, did not grant bail to the defendant. He adjourned the case till July 1, 2022.  All rights reserved.
