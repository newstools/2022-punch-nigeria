An Ondo Chief Magistrates’ Court sitting in Akure has ordered the remand of a farm labourer, Money Danlandi, for allegedly stabbing his friend, Sunday Babaji, to death during a disagreement over a woman. Danlandi was alleged to have committed the offence at Badokun Camp via Ode-Aye in the Okitipupa Local Government Area of the state and was arraigned before the court on a one-count charge of murder. The prosecutor, Inspector Nelson Akintimehin, told the court that Danlandi committed the offence on May 9, 2022, at about 9pm. He was said to have stabbed Sunday, aged 25, with a knife in his chest, leading to his death. According to the prosecution, the offence contravenes Section 319(1) of the Criminal Code, Cap 37, Vol. 2, Laws of Ondo State, 2016. Danlandi, who appeared before the court without a counsel, pleaded not guilty to the offence but his plea was not taken by the court. Akintimehin prayed the court to remand the defendant at the correctional centre, pending the issuance of advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions in the state. In his ruling, the magistrate, Mr Musa Al-Yunus, remanded the defendant at the Nigerian Correctional Centre, Olokuta, Akure, pending the outcome of advice from the DPP, and, thereafter adjourned the case to August 25 for mention.
