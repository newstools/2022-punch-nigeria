The wife of Lagos State Governor, Dr Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, has called on parents to help kick out drug abuse among boys and pay special attention to their male children. Sanwo-Olu made this call, according to a statement on Wednesday, at the inaugural parenting seminar held at the Lagos House, Alausa, Ikeja. She said, “Our boy-child interventions are aimed at making a positive difference. It is gratifying that it is already catching the fancy of the international community, and I must say we are open to partnerships to scale up our programmes to support the boy-child and secure their future. “Parents have a lot to do to address the plight of the boy-child. The issue of the boy child is a burning one that parents must pay special attention to because if we don’t, the boy child is at risk. “As parents, for instance, we need to desist from exerting pressure on our boys; we need to kick out drug abuse; we just have to focus on all issues affecting the boy child.” The governor’s wife also called on the United Nations to recognise May 16 to commemorate the boy-child in order to promote their welfare and wellbeing. “I want to renew the call on the UN to fully recognise May 16 as the International Day of the Boy Child in order to deepen initiatives and interventions targeted at promoting the interest, welfare, and wellbeing of the boy-child globally. “This seminar was aimed at ensuring that parents have in-depth understanding of the nitty-gritty of effective approaches to the upbringing of the boy-child in order to address social vices such as rape, drug abuse, cultism, bullying, and others,” she added.
