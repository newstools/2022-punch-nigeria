The committee conducting the primary election for Peoples Democratic Party in Osun East Senatorial District was forced to postpone the exercise on Monday following a disagreement on the list of delegates. Delegates that would vote at the exercise and other officials had converged on Oba Okunade Sijuade Hall, Enuwa, Ile-Ife for the primary when a disagreement broke out on the list of delegates. Though it was not immediately clear what the contention was, but the committee announced that the exercise had been postponed. Senator Francis Fadahunsi, the current lawmaker representing the District is seeking the ticket for another term, against an ex-member representing Ijesa South Federal Constituency, Mr. Gbenga Onigbogi. In Osun West, ex chairman, Irewole local government, Mr. Lere Oyewumi, emerged winner of the ticket at the primary held in Iwo.
He contested against Mr. Peter Babalola. Voting was still ongoing at the venue of PDP primary for Osun Central Senatorial District in Osogbo as of the time of filing this report. When contacted for reaction, acting state chairman of the party, Mr. Adekunle Akindele, in text message sent to our correspondent simply wrote, ‘No update yet. I will feed you when there is.’ The three incumbent House of Representatives members from Osun all won re-election ticket. Mr. Bamidele Salam, currently representing Ede Federal Constituency won, while Toafeek Ajilesoro, the incumbent lawmaker representing Ife Federal Constituency and Mr. Oluwole Oke, representing Ijesa North Federal Constituency, also won ticket to contest for another term.
