A former director in the Federal Civil Service, Dr Olubunmi Siyanbola, has pledged support for the development of Osun State especially Ibokunland, saying she will do everything within her power to enhance peace, unity and growth. According to a statement on Thursday, she made the commitment shortly after she was conferred with the traditional title of Yeyemeto of Ibokunland by the Alademure of Ibokunland, Oba Festus Adegboro, in a ceremony that was attended by top dignitaries including officials of the Osun State Government and the Federal Government. According to her, the development of the state will be her top priority, noting that job creation among youths and empowerment of the populace through various initiatives will top her agenda. She thanked the Ibokunland Development Union and other key stakeholders for their support. The statement said Siyanbola’ services endeared her to many governors including Governor Oyetola Adegboyega of Osun State; and the Osun State Commissioner for Finance/Chairman of the 2022 Ibokun Day, Chief Bola Oyebamiji.
