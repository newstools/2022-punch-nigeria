Some bandits in large numbers in the early hours of Saturday invaded Jere town in Kagarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State, killing one and abducting scores, including four members of the same family. It was gathered that the bandits killed a newlywed groom and took away his pregnant wife. The bandits also went away with four members of the family of Abdulrahman Ibrahim Jere, a former Commissioner of Poverty Alleviation in the state. According to a source, the bandits stormed the community riding on over 50 on motorbikes, moving from house-to-house to carry out “their nefarious activities.” “We could not sleep. The bandits came in large numbers on motorcycles, each carrying a sophisticated weapon and went from house to house. “But they headed for the former Commissioner’s residence where they abducted the wife, a baby (girl), sister and his sister-in-law,” he said. The source said when the bandits got to the home of the newlywed couple, the groom resisted the move to abduct his wife, making the bandits to shoot him dead. The attack, he said, angered the residents, especially the youth, who felt that with the presence of security agents, such attack could still take place. They wondered how the hoodlums could operate for three hours uninterrupted. He added that hours after the raid, security operatives surfaced and claimed they had killed two of the bandits. The Kaduna State Police Command had yet to confirm the incident as a call put through to the Command’s Public Relstions Officer, ASP Mohammed Jaluge, indicated that his telephone was engaged.
