The Director-General of the Nigerian Mining Cadastre Office, Obadiah Nkom, has said the number of valid mineral titles in Nigeria is currently about 7,200. This is a slight increase from about 7,017 mineral titles in 2021, according to a document on the MCO’s website, titled ‘Valid Mineral Titles as of December 2021.’ The NMCO DG further said that the agency has generated N1.63bn as of April 2022. He said, “Our revenue as of the end of April 2022, on a slow start, is N1.262bn”, adding, “As of today, we have 7,200 valid mineral titles.” The Mining Cadastre Office is responsible for the management and administration of mineral titles. The agency also keeps a chronological record of all applications for mineral titles in a priority register, which ensures the agency treats all applications on a first come first served basis and equally applies the principle of ‘use it or lose it’ to mineral titles. Nkom further noted that the agency is in consultation with some Germany-based experts on developing an application that would boost the application for mineral titles in Nigeria. He added that the launch of the application should have been done two years ago but was hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic. “The launching we are talking about, we would have done it two years ago but COVID came, and it hampered the process completely. You know there was a complete shutdown, and the consultants are based in Germany. I think this is the first time we had a physical meeting with them in South Africa. We have had virtual meetings with them consistently,” Nkom said. The DG NMCO also said that the application should be ready in the next two months to ensure a seamless online application for mineral titles in Nigeria. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
