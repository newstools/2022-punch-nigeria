Nollywood actress and filmmaker, Omoni Oboli, on Thursday recounts her childhood with her single mum who raised her. In an Instagram post, the mother-of-three noted that she wasn’t born with a silver spoon. According to her, her earliest memories were when she lived in a ‘face-me-I-face-you’ home with her mother. Oboli noted that her mother had to take other jobs in addition to her teaching job, so that they could make ends meet. She added that as a kid, she never visited the airport, talk more of traveling outside Nigeria. She wrote, “I wasn’t born with a silver spoon! My earliest memories were in a face me I face you home; raised by a single mom. “We always had more months left at the end of the money every single month. My mum had multiple hustles in addition to her teaching job just to make ends meet! “I never visited the airport not to talk of traveling outside Nigeria as a kid.” Using her story as a form of motivation, she told her fans that if she could get to where she was today, then they can do the same. “If I can get to where I am today, you CAN! Truth is I’m just getting started! You don’t have to like me but I will motivate you to succeed,” she said. The actress added, “Life is one percent what happens to you and 99 percent what you do about it. “Change will start when you are honest enough to say to yourself, ‘I am sick and tired of where I am'”.
