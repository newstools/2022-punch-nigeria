All Progressive Congress presidential hopeful, Bola Tinubu, on Tuesday stated that the youths of Nigeria should be meaningfully engaged to harness their talents for the nation’s growth. Tinubu made this disclosure while seeking the support of Gombe delegates, adding that the only way Nigeria will regain her pride of place is to look inward. He also said that the government should realise the importance of electricity in the nation’s development. “We must develop new methods to develop our country. The change in Lagos is just the beginning. We will collaborate with all the states of the federation because one rich man with seven poor men are all poor. We must collaborate to help ourselves,” he said. He said even though he has come to ask the people to be the President of Nigeria, he can only be there through their votes. Tinubu begged the delegates to choose wisely when it is time to choose the president by choosing him to fly the flag of the party. “I have everything it takes to be the president of Nigeria. I have the brain, the talents, and the courage,” he said. Earlier, Governor Muhammadu Yahaya of Gombe State, in his welcome address lauded Tinubu for his fatherly role in the APC saying that he is not just a father to the party but also a father to the whole nation. “I know you are a genius in discovering talents and using them for the benefit of the people. We have seen what you have done in Lagos in respect of this which translated into Lagos alone having three powerful offices in the cabinet of President Muhammadu Buhari. “This is the kind of person that Nigeria needs at this point in time. A person that will be able to put round pegs in round holes,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
