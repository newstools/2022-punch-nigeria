Businessman and socialite, Obi Iyiegbu, popularly known as Obi Cubana, has promised to give the sum of N2m each to 20 of his secondary school classmates, who are struggling financially. In a video, the socialite urged his other secondary schoolmates to set up a trust fund that will cater for the poor amongst them. Cubana said, “Life is not just about taking pictures and posting on Instagram. I mean, many people think that we have made it in life. People are going through hell and to the glory of God, some of us, God has actually blessed us. “So I want to propose something tonight. I want us C92 to do something significant tonight. I want us to set up a fund that will cater, that will take care of some of our classmates who are not well to do. “I will support this noble cause by picking up 20 people. When you identify these 20 people, 20 people from the poorest and the poor amongst us, I want to give them N2m. “Don’t be intimidated by anything. We are not giving because we have, but we are giving because God has enabled us to do so.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
