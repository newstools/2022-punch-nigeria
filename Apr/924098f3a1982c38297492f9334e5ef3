The Redeemed Christian Church of God has taken disciplinary measures against Leke, son of the General Overseer of the church, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, over the former’s comment labelling some pastors in the mission ‘goats’. The younger Adeboye had called some pastors in the mission ‘goats’ for preaching after his dad’s sermon last Sunday, as all parishes of the church weren’t supposed to entertain any sermon on first Sundays after the GO’s sermon was broadcast live. Leke’s comment had generated outrage with many calling on RCCG to take disciplinary measures against him. In a statement posted on his verified Instagram account on Thursday, the younger Adeboye apologised for the comment. The statement was titled, ‘My Sincere Apology’, read, “I wish to use this medium to tender my unreserved apologies on the statement made from my social media handle about some of our esteemed Pastors “The disciplinary measures taken by the mission is well received and this period will be used to reflect and introspect. “I wish to crave your indulgence to please forgive my extreme statement which I wish to emphasise was absolutely not intended to insult or malign. “I also wish to apologise profusely to the entire leadership and Pastors of our beloved Church who might have been hurt by this statement. “I remain humbly yours in God’s love and mercies. Yours in His service, Leke Adeboye.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
