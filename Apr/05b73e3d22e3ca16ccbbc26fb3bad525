Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie, has caused a stir on social media following the announcement of his second marriage to Nigerian actress, Judy Austin. Yul’s brother, Linc, who is also an actor, however, noted that he wasn’t there when his brother paid bride price for the second wife. Linc was replying to an inquisitive fan who took to his comment section to ask if he was present when the dowry was being paid. The fan, with the username @angy_talks01 asked in Pidgin, “You see wetin your brother do. You follow them go pay bride price on Sunday abi you no follow? Answer me now.” In response, Linc said, “Please don’t piss me off. I wasn’t there.” Yul on Wednesday went public with his second marriage, adding that his new wife already had a son for him. The actor’s first wife of 17 years, May, has since unfollowed her husband on Instagram, after his announcement. Reacting to the news of the marriage, the mother-of-four called down the judgement of God on the latest couple. Taking to the comment section of her husband’s announcement post, May wrote, “May God judge you both.” Meanwhile, Yul has took to his Instagram page to hail himself as a “real” man who owns up to his responsibilities.
