A Nollywood actor and model, Alexx Ekubbo, has lamented over the Abuja-Kaduna train terrorist attacks, saying “It’s one week one trouble.” He said that Nigeria was just in an unending series of bad events. “It’s like we take one baby step forward in Nigeria, & jump 99 giant steps backward. We can’t seem to catch a break. It’s one week one trouble. “We are just in an unending series of bad events. “Someone said Nigeria is run by the evil step mum, I believe it! Because no mother would see her children 300 million of them in constant pain & agony,” Ekubo had posted on his Facebook on Thursday. “Dear God, please have mercy, have mercy on your children we are crying out to you, please make it stop. “Whoever we have offended dead or alive please have mercy, innocent kids are paying with their blood for what they know nothing about. The actor expressed his condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims of the attack and urged people to pray for Nigeria. “My deepest condolences to the families that have lost someone in this senseless spineless act of cowardice. #PrayForNigeria,” Ekubo posted.
