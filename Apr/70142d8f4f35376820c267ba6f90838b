The Chief Press Secretary to Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, Yinka Oyebode, has described as mischievous the allegation that the governor tampers with funds allocated to local government areas in the state. Oyebode, who spoke via a press statement, was responding to a statement credited to a former chairman of Ado Local Government Council, Mrs Omotunde Fajuyi, on the issue. Oyebode said, “The monthly allocations from the Federation Account Allocation Committee to the councils are determined by the JAAC (Joint Account Allocation Committee) at the state level in line with relevant provisions of the law. “The JAAC meeting usually has in attendance the council chairmen, the commissioner for local government, state and local governments auditors-general, among other state officials. “While the JAAC meeting is held monthly to determine how the allocations to the local council would be disbursed, it is on record that Governor Fayemi never meddled in the JAAC affairs nor superintends over any of its meetings. “Except for the purpose of mischief, Mrs Fajuyi knew the governor never had anything to do with JAAC throughout her tenure as council boss.’’ According to Oyebode, it is common knowledge that statutory deductions were responsible for the difference between gross allocation to local councils from FAAC and the net distributable to JAAC.
