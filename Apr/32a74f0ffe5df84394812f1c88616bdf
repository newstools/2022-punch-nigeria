EKITI State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, said on Wednesday that his government had attracted $40m to boost agribusiness in the state. Fayemi said that one of the industries attracted to the state had planted 4,000 hectares of cassava, just as the Ikun Dairy Farm, with 400 cows in stock, was producing 150,000 litres of milk monthly. The governor, represented by the Commissioner for Agriculture, Dr Olabode Adetoyi, spoke at a “Citizens’ Engagement” programme attended by various groups to sensitise the populace on the achievements of his administration. He said, “We have attracted $400m fund to boost agriculture. One of the industries we attracted to Ekiti had planted 4,000 hectares for cassava. Even, Ekiti is now planting ginger. The Ikun Dairy Farm is producing 150,000 litres of milk monthly, with 400 cows in stock. “We are making farming very attractive, we must all partake in it. We distributed 100,000 cocoa and cashew seedlings in 2021, that is why we must allow continuity by voting for Biodun Oyebanji in the June 18 poll.” The Speaker, Ekiti State House of Assembly, Funminiyi Afuye, represented by the Leader of Government Business, Gboyega Aribisogan, lauded Fayemi for renovating 30 schools in Ikole and Oye local government areas. The Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Community Engagements and Enlightenment, Mrs Tosin Ajisafe-Aluko, said the programme was initiated to inform the populace about what Fayemi had done and bridge the existing communication gap.
