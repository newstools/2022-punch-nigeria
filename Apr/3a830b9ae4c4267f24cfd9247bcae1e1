The Senior Special Assistant to the Vice President on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, Monday in Abuja said President Muhammadu Buhari (retd)’s regime made commendable strides in the areas of infrastructure, and ease of doing business and security. Akande made this assertion in an interview on Arise News Night on Monday. According to him, Vice-President Osinbajo’s bid for the country’s top job is meant to consolidate the gains made in the past seven years. “The Buhari administration has achieved so much in terms of infrastructure development, ease of doing business and this is what Professor Yemi Osinbajo wants to continue,” he said. Osinbajo, in a closely-watched telecast early on Monday, declared his intention to contest the All Progressives Congress presidential ticket ahead of next year’s election. Hours earlier, the he had met with some members of the Progressives Governors Forum at his official residence, Aguda House, where he made his intentions known. Osinbajo at a dinner he hosted at the Presidential Villa for the breaking of Ramadan fast (Iftar), informed the APC governors of his plan to succeed Buhari, whose tenure as President ends in 13 months’ time. Some of the governors present include: Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun, Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa, Babagana Zulum of Borno and Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos.
