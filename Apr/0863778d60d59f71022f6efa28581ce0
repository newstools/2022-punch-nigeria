Coleman Wires and Cables (Coleman Technical Industries Ltd) says it has successfully paid back series two N3.804bn under its N20bn CP Issuance Programme on the FMDQ Exchange. According to a statement by the company, Coleman recently admitted N6.05 billion series 3 & 4 Commercial Paper under its N20bn CP Issuance Programme on the FMDQ Exchange. Reacting to the development, the Managing Director/CEO of Coleman, Mr. George Onafowokan, said that this would enable the company to increase the capacity of the business with additional working capital. Onafowokan said, “The major advantage of this to Coleman is the credibility the repayment of the series ll gives to us as an indigenous manufacturing company. “It has never been seen by anybody in the cable industry in Nigeria and West Africa to sustain such repayment. For us to sustain this, it means that we can sustain the business itself and the projection of the growth of the business and most importantly, we can sustain its expansion and its workforce.” According to him, indigenous companies were capable of sustaining their repayment and growing their businesses based on the trust they had built in the capital market over time.
