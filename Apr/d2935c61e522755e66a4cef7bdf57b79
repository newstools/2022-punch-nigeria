The World Savings and Retail Banking Institute has said it is committed to inclusive financial services for Nigerian women, youths and farmers through its programme, Scale2Save. It said this during the Scale2Save financial inclusion knowledge sharing event attended by key financial stakeholders across the country in Lagos. The institute said financial inclusion was important to fuel the country’s economic recovery and growth. It explained that Scale2Save was a six-year programme of the World Savings and Retail Banking Institute in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation, aimed at establishing the viability of low-balanced savings accounts and to unravel the extent to which savings help vulnerable people in the society to boost their financial wellbeing. In her keynote address, the Scale2Save Programme Director, Weselina Angelow, highlighted the importance of stakeholders’ knowledge sharing events towards Nigeria’s quest for inclusive growth and economic development. “As we intensify efforts to improve financial inclusion, it is important that all stakeholders are part of knowledge and insight-based discourse as this to improve on their processes and make informed financial inclusion decisions,” she said.
