The Chief Judge of Taraba State, Justice Filibus Andetur, on Thursday, inaugurated a 10-man Administration of Criminal Justice Monitoring Committee to spearhead judicial reforms in the state. The inauguration was the highlight of a one day workshop on strengthening the application of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law in Taraba organised by the state criminal justice stakeholders supported by the MacArthur Foundation in Jalingo. Andetur, who is the chairman of the committee, urged members to ensure that the Taraba ACJL, which was assented to by Governor Darius Ishaku in December last year, was fully implemented for the benefit of the state. According to him, when fully implemented, the law would make justice dispensation easier and thus help in tackling corruption and social ills in the country. “I believe that the implementation of the administration of criminal justice law will simplify the work of the prosecutors, judges and magistrates and make speedy dispensation of justice. “The monitoring committee of this all-important assignment must be committed to achieving the desired goal of enhancing speedy justice dispensation,” he said. The National Secretary, Administration of Criminal Justice Monitoring Committee, Mr Suleiman Dawodu, noted at the occasion that Taraba was the 17th state to inaugurate the committee out of the 25 states where the ACJL was set up. He commended the state for promptly keying into the global best practice of judicial reforms for a better society. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
