According to CBS Sports’ Roger Gonzalez, Watford defender William Troost-Ekong is set for a move to MLS side LA Galaxy. The 28-year-old is expected to join the American club on loan in the summer transfer window. Troost-Ekong helped the Hornets gain promotion to the English Premier League from the EFL Championship after joining from Udinese last season, and was a regular at the beginning of this campaign, starting 18 of Watford’s first 21 Premier League matches. Since returning from the Africa Cup of Nations in January, where he picked up a niggling injury, Troost-Ekong has not featured for Watford. Roy Hodgson has preferred Nicolas N’Koulou and Craig Cathcart as his preferred centre-backs pairing, with the Nigerian only limited to bench roles. Looking to retain his spot as Nigeria captain, particularly with another AFCON coming up next year, the defender has however been given a chance by Galaxy, who are in need of a centre-back, with just Nick DePuy, Sega Coulibaly and Derrick Williams the only three defenders at the disposal of head coach Greg Vanney. However, according to Watford Observer, a Watford-based publication, the club have played down reports that they are in talks with LA Galaxy over a potential loan move for Troost-Ekong. “Club sources say they have received no calls from the Major League Soccer side, after claims in America suggested they were interested in signing the Nigeria captain temporarily,” the website wrote.
