The Managing Director, Unity Bank Plc, Mrs Oluwatomi Somefun, has said the bank remains committed to its strategic partnership with maize farmers to support their capacity to sustain the sufficiency in maize production. A statement said she spoke at the official unveiling of 21 maize pyramids in Kaduna, when the Nigerian maize farmers under the auspices of Maize Farmers Association of Nigeria commended the bank for its role in facilitating the financing of maize production by smallholder farmers in the country through the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN. She said, “When we say that we are farmers’ best friends, we walk our talk. And I am glad that the association appreciates the invaluable support that we provide by facilitating the financing of their activities. “As a bank, we are driven by the overarching objectives of the Federal Government to drive food sufficiency, while creating the much-needed jobs for sustainable development.” Somefun who was represented by the Executive Director, Risk Management and Compliance, Mr Usman Abdulkadir, said the pyramids displayed was a reminder of the inherent possibilities in Nigeria’s agricultural value chains and a proof that with enough commitment, Nigeria could maximise its potential in agriculture through strategic initiatives such as the Anchor Borrowers Programme. The President of MAAN, Dr Bello Abubakar, said Unity Bank has proved to be a trusted and reliable partner of Nigerian maize farmers in their journey to sustain sufficiency in maize production in the country.
