The General Overseer of the Omega Fire Ministries International, Apostle Johnson Suleman, has said he will ensure that any man in his church who assaults his wife gets beaten too. This is as he advised women in abusive marriages to leave while they are still alive, adding that those who choose to remain will only be buried if they die as a result of domestic violence. Apostle Suleman said this while addressing his congregation amid news of the death of Gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu, who allegedly died as a result of domestic violence. He said, “When I once said there are certain marriages that should break, there was nothing they didn’t say about me. That’s why I kept quiet now, or did you hear me say anything? “But that’s what everyone is saying now. Somebody reach out to me, saying, ‘when you said it years ago they insulted you.'” He continued, “All those women that their husbands are beating, don’t they have brothers? If they don’t have biological brothers, they have Christian brothers. “If you are in this church and you are beating your wife, stop it. If she reports you to me, we will beat you. “I will go to the police station and take permission before I gather brothers in this church to beat you.” He added, “The Bible only said thou shall not kill, it didn’t say thou shall not beat. “Only weak men beat women, men that lack capacity. How did you get the woman? You talked. How do you keep the woman? You talk. You control a woman with your mouth, not your hand.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
