The Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite, has told the Belgian Ambassador to Nigeria, Daniel Betrand, that the ministry is looking forward to collaborating with his country on the development of the mining sector in Africa’s most populous nation. Adegbite made this statement during the visit of the Belgian ambassador to the ministry. This was disclosed through a press statement by the minister’s Special Adviser on Media, Ayodeji Adeyemi,on Wednesday. Adegbite told Betrand that the ministry was making the sector more vibrant by fulfilling its mandate to diversify the economy away from oil, create jobs and raise the revenue profile of the government. The minister also said that the ministry’s recent achievement in the area of local barite production met the American Petroleum Institute’s standards, noting  that this would save the country millions of dollars spent on importing barite, a mineral used for a wide variety of items, including computer monitors, brake linings, clutch pads, paint and radiation shields.
