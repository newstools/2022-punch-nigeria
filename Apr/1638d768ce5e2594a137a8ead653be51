The Secretary to the Government of Katsina State, Mustapha Inuwa, has resigned his appointment to enable him contest in the 2023 state governorship race. His resignation was with effect from April 15, 2022. The SSG’s Director (Press), Alhaji Abdullahi Yar’adua, confirmed the resignation in a statement in Katsina on Thursday evening. Yar’adua explained that the SSG’s decision to resign “followed his desire to contest in the forthcoming gubernatorial election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress.” Yar’adua further explained, “In the resignation letter he wrote to His Excellency, the Governor of Katsina State, Rt. Hon. Aminu Bello Masari, CFR, Dr. Mustapha Inuwa expressed his profound gratitude for the singular honour and privilege given to him by the governor since 2015 to date. “That, he said, had given him the opportunity to offer his humble and modest contributions in serving the governor, government and good people of Katsina State in that capacity.” The statement added that the outgoing SSG prayed Almighty Allah to further strengthen the Governor Masari-led Administration in the last lap of its final tenure. Inuwa also reportedly thanked the entire people of the state for their continued support and cooperation being extended to him as well as the APC government in the state. The statement revealed that Governor Masari had accepted the resignation with effect from April 15, 2022, in a letter which read in part, “I hereby wish to refer to your letter No. SGKT/ADM/PER/1775/VOL:II/44 dated 15th April, 2022, in which you forwarded your resignation of appointment as Secretary to the Government of the State with effect from 15th April, 2022. “As a result of the above, I wish to inform you that I have accepted your resignation with effect from 15 April, 2022.” The governor, on behalf of the government and people of the state, expressed his deepest appreciation for the services which Inuwa rendered as the SSG from 2015 to date.
