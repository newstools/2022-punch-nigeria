Kidnapped Managing Director of the Bank of Agriculture, Alwan Ali-Hassan, was released in the spirit of Ramadan, his captors have said. The terrorists made this known in an 81-second video posted on Twitter by a Senior Conflict Analyst at the Tony Blair Institute, Bulama Bukarti. In the video, Ali-Hassan was flanked by four heavily armed men dressed in military camouflage. After a short prayer and praise of God and his prophet in Arabic language, one of the terrorists said, “We are the ones who kidnapped the people on the train. We decided to release this man (Ali-Hassan) because of the honour of the month of Ramadan and because he is old. He has been pleading since we kidnapped him. “The government should know that the train attack is just a little of what we can do.” Also, Ali-Hassan, in the video, said he was freed because of his age. Analysing the video, Bukarti said that early evidence suggests that Abuja-Kaduna train attackers are Boko Haram fighters. The PUNCH had earlier reported that Ali-Hassan, on Wednesday, regained his freedom from terrorists who kidnapped him alongside others after bombing an Abuja-Kaduna train on Monday, March 28, 2022. The Kaduna-bound train officially had over 362 passengers but unconfirmed reports claimed the passengers were more than that. Some of the passengers have been confirmed dead, scores injured and others in the den of the vicious terrorists who have launched daring attacks in Kaduna in the last two weeks.
