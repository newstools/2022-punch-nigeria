A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Ogun State chapter, Adekunle Ayoola, has advised the new National Chairman of the party, Abdullahi Adamu, to ensure unity among party members. Ayoola also commended the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for ensuring the success of the party’s convention despite all odds. In a statement on Friday, Ayoola said, “I must congratulate our newly-elected National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, a two-term governor and currently a senator representing Nasarawa West. “He is a seasoned politician and truly possesses the capability to steer the party to the path of greater heights and victory even as 2023 general elections approach. “The major task ahead of Senator Adamu’s leadership would be to ensure genuine reconciliation and unity of the party members across the nation. “No sacrifice should be considered too big to make the party more formidable and continue governance beyond 2023.”  All rights reserved.
