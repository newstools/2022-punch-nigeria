The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), Thursday in Abuja called on parents and religious leaders to caution their youths against the recent spate of murder, kidnappings and sexual assault by rival cult groups in Ogun State. This was after he said that the police and other law enforcement agencies must confront head-on, groups seeking to destroy peace and bring disorder before they gain strength. According to a statement signed late Thursday by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari was reacting to reports reaching him on the renewed cult violence between the Eiye and Aiye cult groups which has persisted for over a week, following the killing of key leaders of both groups. It read in part, “What should frighten us is that the deadly cult groups are increasingly attracting lonely, anxious, troubled youth who they trap in unorthodox social practices. Parents and religious leaders must come to grasp what is going on and halt the radicalization of our youth.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
