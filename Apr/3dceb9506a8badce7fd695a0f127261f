SWIFTA, a technology solutions provider, has announced the relaunch of its cloud platform, SwiftaCloud, According to the firm, its platform now has a range of affordable enterprise and B2B solutions ranging from Software-as-a-service to Infrastructure-as-a-Service, and Platform-as-a-service. It added that it has plans to pivot and attract a new class of customers in Small and Medium-scale Enterprises across different sectors. In a statement, the Chief Executive Officer, Swifta Systems, Ayotunde Farinu, said, “Contrary to the hype around cloud being the future of the enterprise, cloud computing is here and happening right now. “The question businesses must focus on is not when, but how to most effectively integrate cloud into their business operations. We are almost beyond the era of transition and are gradually stepping into the phase of transforming our businesses with the cloud. With the widespread growth of cloud computing and mobile tech, more and more businesses are moving to a service model for everything they do. “This is why the most popular cloud offering to date— Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)—is quickly giving way to what is being termed “Everything-as-a-Service” (EaaS). While the SaaS model is all about offering vendor-managed software and licensing, EaaS brings cloud-based management and outsourcing not only to software, but to hardware, processing, data management, and information tracking as well. EaaS is a more fully automated process of offering cloud services to businesses and end-users.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
