The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry has expressed its readiness to forge a better collaboration with the Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers to open up the organised private sector to the values of insurance. The President of the Chamber, Dr. Michael Olawale-Cole, gave the assurance when members of the council’s delegation, led by its President, Mr Rotimi Edu, paid a courtesy visit to the chamber in Lagos. Olawale-Cole said the chamber, one of the foremost and formidable financial advocacy platforms, would be offered to insurance brokers to propagate knowledge about the values of insurance to business and commerce. He said the two organisations would have a lot to do together under his administration as the president, and urged members of the NCRIB to join LCCI. Also speaking, Edu said the visit of the council to LCCI was part of its strategic engagement with professional bodies to broaden the frontiers of its relevance among the organised private sector in Nigeria.
