Ahead of the 2022 Easter celebration, the Abia State Command of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps says it has beefed up security to ensure a hitch-free celebration in the State. The Commandant, Ayinla Taiye Olowo, disclosed this after a crucial meeting with his Management Team at the Command Headquarters in Umuahia. He said, “We have made strategic deployments of our personnel to locations in line with intelligence information available to us. “We are equally collaborating with other Sister Security Agencies in the State to ensure that Abia remains safe before, during and after the celebration.” He appreciated the Commandant General- Ahmed Abubakar Audi for ensuring that Abia State got a fair share in the recently concluded personnel recruitment into the Service and charged the new recruits to be focused and committed. He also expressed his hope in the ability of Nigeria to overcome her security challenges. He said, “The injection of fresh crop of personnel into the Corps through recruitment is one of the outlined steps towards tackling insecurity in the country.” He assured that their training will strictly follow the Harmonized Basic Training, adding that they will thereafter be exposed to more training in batches at the various training colleges of the Corps. While appreciating the general public for their confidence in the Corps through providing timely and adequate information, he solicited greater co-operation of the people to ensure that criminal elements in our society do not have hiding places. Ayinla charged Christians to use this sober period to pray for peace, unity and economic development of the country. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
