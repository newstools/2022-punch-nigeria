Fast-rising Nigerian comedian, I Go Tuk, on Thursday hailed popular comedian and actor, Ayo Makun, after the latter invited him to perform on his show. I Go Tuk, who made millions of naira on stage while performing at AY Live comedy show on Sunday, took to his Instagram page to thank AY for the opportunity to perform. Sharing pictures of himself and AY, I Go Tuk hailed the actor for using his platform to market other comedians. Praising the actor, the fast rising comedian wrote, “A man that doesn’t discriminate. He doesn’t care if you are Igbo, Hausa, or Yoruba. “As long as you are good in the business of comedy, he will sell you with his platform without thinking about it.” The comedian went on to pray for AY, saying, “The God I serve that gave me the grace on your show will forever keep blessing you and your family. “Nations, kings, and presidents will recognise you. As you have given me your platform to show what I have, heaven will always show you to the world. “Favour, mercy, and grace shall always follow you. @aycomedian God bless you sir. I’m very grateful. Thank you so much.” I Go Tuk’s thrilling performance was a part of the highlights of AY’s show after he got donations from the audience worth over N7m. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
