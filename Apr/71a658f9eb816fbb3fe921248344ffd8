Some gunmen on Sunday invaded an eatery around the Federal Polytechnic, Oko, Anambra State, dispossessing employees, customers and fun seekers of their mobile phones and other valuables. While nobody was killed during the attack, a source said the situation caused panic in the area, as people, who came to relax for the Easter celebration, scampered to safety. PUNCH Metro gathered that the attack, which lasted several minutes, happened during heavy rainfall. The source said, “They simply dispossessed all the customers and employees at the eatery of their phones and other valuables and left the area without any challenge, despite an armoured car and security personnel being positioned in the area. “Nobody was killed and nobody was shot. Even the new police armoured tank stationed around the area and the policemen did not repel them. “They arrived at the fast food joint and collected all the phones of people eating there. They set fire in the frontage of the fast food. The eatery just opened that branch.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Tochukwu Ikenga, called for information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects. Ikenga said, “The Anambra State Police Command today, April 18, 2022, wishes to urge the victims of the incident to come forward and report. “This will help the police with necessary information to investigate and deploy personnel in this regard. This will also help to avert such incidents from recurring in the area or any place in the state.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
