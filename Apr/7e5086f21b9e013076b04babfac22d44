Super Eagles goalkeeper Carl Ikeme trained with Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers. The club made this known via a series of tweets on its Twitter handle on Sunday. This is coming nearly five years after Ikeme suffered cancer. The club posted, “Great to see @Carl_Ikeme back doing what he does best. We invited @Carl_Ikeme back to Compton to train with our first-team. It’s like you’ve never been away.” In July 2017, Ikeme was diagnosed with the disease after returning for Wolverhampton Wanderers pre-season ahead of their 2017-18 season. However, after undergoing a rigorous 12-month treatment, he was in complete remission but the disease ended his football career and denied him a place at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Ikeme made his debut for the Super Eagles in 2015 and soon became the first-choice goalkeeper following the retirement of Vincent Enyeama. But his condition denied a chance of participating at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
