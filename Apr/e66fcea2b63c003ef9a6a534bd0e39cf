With the inauguration of the Dangote Fertiliser Plant, in Lagos, Nigeria has commenced the exportation of Urea-based fertiliser to the U.S, India, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. The Executive Director, Strategy Capital Projects and Portfolio Development, Dangote Group, Devakumar Edwin, disclosed this on Sunday when the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed led a team of journalists on a working tour of the Dangote Fertiliser Plant in Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos. The minister and his team also took a tour of the Dangote Petroleum Refinery and Petrochemicals, also located at the Lekki Free Trade Zone in Ibeju Lekki. Speaking at a newly constructed jetty for the urea export, Edwin said the plant had the capacity to meet the 1.5 million metric tonnes per annum current level of fertiliser consumption in Nigeria and also export the product. He said the Dangote Urea, made from natural gas is an export quality product with global standard, hence the demand for it in the global market. Edwin assured that the plant would continue to meet local demand for the product at an affordable price in order to make Nigeria self-reliant in food production. NAN reports that at the jetty, the team witnessed a ship being loaded with Urea for export to Argentina. Speaking at the event, the minister corroborated Edwin, saying that Nigeria is currently self-sufficient in the production of Urea and it is the leading producer of the fertiliser in Africa “Before this administration came into office in 2015, Nigeria had a fertiliser shortfall of about 3.5 million tonnes per annum (over 6 million tonnes per annum are required in the country). “Thanks to the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative launched by President Buhari, indigenous companies like Indorama and Notore – with a combined capacity of over 2.5 million tonnes per annum,” he said (NAN)
