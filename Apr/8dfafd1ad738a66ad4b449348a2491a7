The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, has ordered an investigation to unravel the identity of an officer captured smoking weed in public in the Ijora area of Lagos State. Sunday PUNCH gathered that the picture, which was taken by a concerned fellow, was posted online. The post which went viral was reposted by Instablog on Instagram. A message attached to the post read, “Nigerian police officer at Ijora Lagos smoking weed on duty.” Reacting to the development, the acting Force Public Relations Officer, CSP Muyiwa Adejobi, while condemning the incident, said the IGP would take necessary disciplinary action against the errant policeman. He noted that the Lagos State Police Command had been contacted to fish out the officer for appropriate sanction. He said, “The police have commenced necessary action on this ugly scene. We have contacted the Lagos command to fish him out, name and shame him, and necessary disciplinary measures will be taken from the office of the IGP with immediate effect. “This is condemned in its totality. It’s quite unfortunate that we can see an officer of the police, in uniform, degenerate to this level. We just kick against this to serve as a deterrent to others.” Copyright PUNCH.
