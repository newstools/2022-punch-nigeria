Presidential aspirant and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has asked women to work with him to make the party great. He urged them not to be confined to the shadows, but be empowered in all social, economic, and political spheres. Tinubu disclosed this during an interactive session with a delegation comprising the party’s zonal and state women leaders, who visited him in Abuja. A statement by the Tinubu Media Office on Friday quoted Tinubu as describing the women as a constructive force that had contributed to the APC’s vibrant present and equitable future. “I do not believe women should be confined to the shadows. Rather, I believe that by empowering women in all social, economic and political spheres, we invite exponential social, economic and political growth in Nigeria,” he said. While seeking their support, he said, “Partner with me to create an unbeatable coalition that will win the general elections in February 2023 for all APC candidates, including, I hope, a record number of women”. He stressed that the journey was not merely about realising a lifelong ambition, but a goal to “secure the future of our nation and the good and able governance of its people”.  Copyright PUNCH.
