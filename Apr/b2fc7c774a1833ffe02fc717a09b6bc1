The Technical Director, Nigeria Volleyball Federation, Martin Melandi, says the federation’s primary target is to place Nigeria among the top-ranked countries in the world, The PUNCH reports. Regarded as one of the best countries in Africa, Nigeria is currently ranked 74 in the world, with a world record score of 66, according to the International Volleyball Federation. Nigeria qualified for its first-ever World Beach Volleyball Championship in 2019 and the sport has since continued to gain pace in the country following its consistent participation in tournaments in Africa, as well as an organised league, the National Division One and National Division Two. Speaking with The PUNCH, Melandi said he was confident that the country would soon be counted among the best in the sport. “The future is very bright for Nigerian volleyball because Nigeria has made a name in beach volleyball and we are one of the top ranking countries in Africa,” the Technical Director said. “We are looking at becoming the topmost country in the world. Remember we are gold medallists at the African Games and that has made us the top-ranked country in Africa. “Now we are looking forward to the upcoming African Youth Games, where we will feature our U-18 and U-19 boys and girls and I trust that we can come top.” Copyright PUNCH.
