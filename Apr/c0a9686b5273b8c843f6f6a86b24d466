The Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, says the credentials of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo speak for themselves. The monarch made this known on Thursday when Osinbajo visited him in his palace in Benin, the Edo State capital, as part of consultations for the VP’s 2023 presidential ambition. The traditional ruler thanked Osinbajo for the visit to his palace stating that he was scheduled to be in Abuja for some official engagement but had to stay back to receive him. Oba of Benin said, “We got a letter from your office just the day before yesterday (Tuesday) that the Vice President is coming. We had to put the trip on hold. “We have heard the reasons why you are here. We don’t need to overflog your credentials, they speak for themselves. “Because of your credentials, humility, calmness, there is no gainsaying that your contestants are shivering where they are.” Osinbajo is one of the All Progressives Congress aspirants. Others include former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu; Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba; Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige; Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi; Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello; former Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha; former Abia State Governor, Orji Kalu; amongst others. The APC presidential primary to decide the party’s flagbearer is scheduled to hold at the end of May 2022. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
