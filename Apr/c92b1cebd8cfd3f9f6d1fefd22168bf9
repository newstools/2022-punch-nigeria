The Lagos State Government on Friday ordered all public and private students in the state to resume on Wednesday, May 4, 2022, noting that only May 2nd and 3rd were approved as public holidays for the 2022 International Workers’ Day and Eid el-Fitr celebrations. The government also told all workers in the state to disregard its earlier circular which approved Monday to Wednesday as public holidays. The state Head of Service, Hakeem Muri-Okunola, in a circular to workers dated April 27, 2022, had approved May 2 to 4 as public holidays, but the state reversed itself in another circular sighted by Saturday PUNCH. In the second circular titled, ‘Re: Year 2022 Workers’ Day Celebration/Eid el-Fitr Public Holidays’, the Lagos HoS said, “Public servants in the state are therefore to disregard the resumption date stated in Circular No 018 of 27th of April, 2022 and note that work resumes on Wednesday, 4th of May, 2022 at 8 am prompt.” Similarly, the Lagos State Government through the Ministry of Education, Office of Education Quality Assurance, notified all public and private schools in the state to resume on Wednesday. In the statement titled, ‘Lagos Public And Private Schools To Resume On Wednesday 4th May 2022’, signed by OEQA Director-General, Abiola Seriki-Ayeni, the ministry told the schools to “disregard Thursday 5th May 2022 as previously embedded in the Lagos State Harmonised Academic Calendar 2021/2022 session,” the statement added.
