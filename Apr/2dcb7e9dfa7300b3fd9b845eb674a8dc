Seven-time champions Lyon came from a goal down to defeat French rivals Paris Saint-Germain 3-2 on Sunday in their Women’s Champions League semi-final first leg. French champions PSG have never won the continental crown but they were in front after just six minutes on Sunday through Marie-Antoinette Katoto. Lyon then replied with goals from Wendie Renard, with a 23rd-minute penalty, and two from American international Catarina Macario in the 34th and 51st minutes. Poland’s Paulina Dudek reduced the deficit with a 58th-minute penalty to keep the capital city side in the tie ahead of the second leg at the Parc des Princes next Saturday. In the other semi-final, played Friday, Barcelona crushed Wolfsburg 5-1 before a women’s world record crowd of 91,648 at the Camp Nou. AFP
