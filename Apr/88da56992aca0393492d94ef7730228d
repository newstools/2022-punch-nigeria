Samsung and UK telco VMO2 have deployed a series of new 4G and 5G sites across the UK. According to telecoms.com, following lab tests last year, field trials had been ongoing on the sites in Tamworth and the Peak District since the beginning of this year, and the sites had now been used to complete the first 5G data call on VMO2’s commercial 5G network. The test demonstrates interoperability between VMO2’s 2G, 3G, and 4G networks and Samsung’s latest 4G and 5G solutions and Dynamic Spectrum Sharing kit. The President and Chief Executive Officer, Samsung Electronics UK, Francis Chun, said, “Samsung is excited to extend our network collaboration with Virgin Media O2 in the U.K., advancing from lab trials to now delivering 4G and 5G in commercial networks out in the field. “We look forward to playing a major part in the diversification of the network equipment supply chain in the UK market.” The Chief Technology Officer at VMO2, Jeanie York, said, “We are pleased to build on our previous collaboration with Samsung, delivering another 5G milestone in our push to developing Open RAN technologies. “We will continue our collaborative efforts with Samsung to explore the possibilities of 5G and push the technology further to deliver superior end-user experiences for our customers.” Samsung kit used in the trials includes 4G radios, 5G 64T64R Massive MIMO radios for the 3.5GHz spectrum, and baseband units. The Samsung radio setup can also be O-RAN-compliant after some configuration changes and additional support, a capability anyone would expect most new network deployments to have if the current political tailwinds make it a necessity.
