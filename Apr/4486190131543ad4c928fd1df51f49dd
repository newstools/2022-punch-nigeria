Remo Stars coach, Gbenga Ogunbote, has called for better playing pitches for Nigeria Professional Football League clubs, especially calling for the renovation of embattled Heartland’s home turf. Remo played a goalless draw against Heartland on Tuesday at the Dan Ayam Stadium in Owerri, but Ogunbote blamed the condition of the pitch for the result. Ogunbote hinted that the condition of the pitch might be one of the reasons the Naze Millionaires were languishing in the relegation zone. “It’s difficult to really assess but I’m not surprised the team is in that position (bottom of the league). They need to look for a better pitch because it is equally affecting them. Sometimes you’ll think it’s an advantage but it is not. “I think this kind of pitch should not have been approved to play football. The pitch didn’t let us (Remo) see the beauty of the game. “The pitch is not good, there are a lot of bumps and you can’t complete three-four successful passes. The truth is, a good pitch will help you and that is what is helping (Enugu) Rangers today because they left a bad pitch to a better one and I think if they (Heartland) leave this pitch to a better one, it will be good for them.” Remo Stars are currently fourth behind Rivers United, Plateau United and Enugu Rangers, while Heartland are bottom of the log.
