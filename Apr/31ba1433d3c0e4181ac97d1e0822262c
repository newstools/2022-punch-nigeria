THE Lagos State Government has said that the Lekki Concession Company is still consulting with landlords of Lekki area to make a concession list on the return of tolling to the Ikoyi Link Bridge. The PUNCH had reported that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu agreed to make some concessions after showing evidence of LCC’s financial situation and why tolling should resume at the toll plaza. The state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, mr. Gbenga Omotoso, in a telephone interview with our correspondent, stated that the reopening of the toll plaza would reduce traffic and increase the lifespan of the bridge. He said, “Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has agreed to grant them some concessions, so the landlords are supposed to work with Lekki Concession Company on agreed modalities and the company will negotiate with them on these, then they will present a list of such concessions to the governor. “The people are yet to come but the governor has agreed in principle that he will grant them concessions. He will not inflict pain on anybody; he wants to make life comfortable for us all. “If we say that the tolling begins on that road, automatically, about 30 per cent of the traffic you see there will go away and that will lengthen the life of the bridge and then the kind of traffic that you may experience will not be there, so it is a win-win situation for everybody. “The governor does not want something that people will feel bad about, so they are still working it out. They are meeting with LCC so they will bring the list and he will sign it.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
