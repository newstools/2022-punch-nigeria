The Ondo State Police Command said it had begun investigation into a bloody assault on a lady, identified as Funmilola Ogundare, in Akure, the state capital. According to the command’s Public Relations Officer, Mrs Funmilayo Odunlami, the victim was attacked by her yet-to-be-identified boyfriend who ran away after the incident. Ogundare was found in the pool of her blood inside her apartment located at Ijapo Estate Area of Akure. The PPRO explained that the suspect took the victim to his friend’s house where he allegedly committed the dastardly act. She said, “It was the owner of the apartment that reported the matter to the police. The suspect took the woman to the apartment to pass the night with her. We are on the lookout for him and investigation has commenced.” The suspect was said to have been inflicted machete cuts on the woman. A source said after the boyfriend fled and left the scene, the neighbours, who heard her groaning in pain, invited the police, who on arrival forced the door of the apartment open and found the victim in the pool of blood. The Executive Secretary of the state’s Agency Against Sexual and Gender-Based Violence, Mrs Bola Joel-Ogundadegbe, who confirmed the incident, said she was informed about the incident by the police and the agency quickly notified the wife of the governor, Mrs Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu, who immediately ordered that the victim be taken to a hospital and, consequently, settled the bills.
