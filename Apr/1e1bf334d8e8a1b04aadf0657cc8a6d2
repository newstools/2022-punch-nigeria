Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers, says Wilfred Ndidi will be fully ready for the start of next season, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Rodgers confirmed that Ndidi won’t feature again this season and will begin his rehabilitation immediately, with the aim of returning for the start of pre-season. The midfielder underwent surgery after coming off during Leicester’s UEFA Europa Conference League last-16, second leg tie with Rennes on March 17. “Wilfred Ndidi will be out for the season, it’s a shame for us but he’ll get ready for next season,” Rodgers said during the pre-match conference ahead of Saturday’s visit to Manchester United. “It’s unfortunate. He’s been a brilliant player for me in my time here. He picked up a nasty injury that has had to have surgery on and he’ll recover now until June.” Ndidi, 25, has made 31 appearances in all competitions for Leicester this season, scoring two goals. He was an ever-present as the Eagles reached the round of 16 at the 2021 AFCON in Cameroon. The knee injury prevented Ndidi from playing for Nigeria in their World Cup qualifying play-off defeat to Ghana. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
