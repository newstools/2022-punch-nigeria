AKWA Ibom State Government has announced a dusk-to-dawn curfew to check further escalation of the crisis between the Ibeno indigenes and Yoruba fishermen in the Ibeno Local Government Area of the state. The Chairman of Ibeno LGA, Mr Henry Mkpa, in a statement by his media officer, Mr Melford Asuquo, which was made available to journalists on Thursday, said the curfew was a prompt action by the state government to prevent a further escalation of the crisis in the oil-rich city of Ibeno. He said the curfew was imposed from 7pm to 6am, adding that both human and vehicular movements are restricted during the period. The statement read in part “Following the violent clash between the Yoruba community and indigenes of Mkpanak group of communities in Ibeno Council Area which resulted in the loss of lives and property, the Executive Chairman of Ibeno Local Government Area has declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew from 7am to 6am with immediate effect till further notice. “Sequel to the above, human and vehicular movements are prohibited in any part of the local government area, while security agencies have been put on alert to strictly enforce this order and anyone found during these hours will be arrested and prosecuted accordingly.” Meanwhile, about five persons were killed and several others missing, while property worth millions of naira destroyed since the crisis erupted on Wednesday. The Deputy Governor, Mr Moses Ekpo, has visited the troubled community which is host to Mobil Producing Nigeria, with a view to calming frayed nerves and providing succour to hundreds of Internally Displaced Persons taking refuge in neighbouring communities.
