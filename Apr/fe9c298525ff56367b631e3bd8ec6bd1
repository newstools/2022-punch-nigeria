Music artiste, Anthony Victor, known widely as Victony, has expressed gratitude to God for saving his life in a ghastly accident that left him in a wheelchair. Reminiscing about the tragic incident, the music sensation said everyone feared for his life after the accident, adding that God and strength from his team members reversed what he described as the darkest times of his life into a blessing. Victony made the statement on Instagram and subsequently announced the release of his new single, ‘Kolomental,’ on Tuesday. He said, “One this day last year, everyone feared for my life. I lived in the dark for a while, as I kept drawing strength from God & the Outlaws. “Together we reversed the darkest times of my life into a blessing, look how far we’ve come. Today symbolizes Victory for all OUTLAWS. I want this to be the soundtrack of our lives as overcomers.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
