Lasaco Assurance Plc has been given a high performance rating of A- in the latest ranking of the risk bearing industry. A statement said the company, which has made a mark in the brokerage and underwriting business within the last four decades, attained this feat through its discipline and strict adherence to professionalism and creativity with which it has touched many lives and helped indemnify people’s risks in times of loss. International rating agency, GCR, which gave the company a ‘stable outlook’ ranking, said Lasaco’s latest rating was due to its prudence and professional discipline. It expressed hope that the latest achievement would spur the company to do more, so that it could continue to experience a steady growth. The latest rating, according to the agency (which has offices in about 37 countries across Africa, including Nigeria), indicated that Lasaco had strength and competitive position, making it flexible for positive growth. The award, it added, showed that the company’s earnings were at an intermediate level while its portfolio was expected to grow as a result of the strategic plans put in place to support growth. The statement said the company had also received ISO certification in recognition of its high standard of practice in security management. “The certification reflects Lasaco as having put in place tools that would strengthen it across the three cyber security pillars of people, processes and technology,” the statement said.
