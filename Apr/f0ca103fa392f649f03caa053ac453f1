A group, Wellness Medical Distribution, has called for ease of access to medical supplies in the country. The firm’s Managing Director, Adetutu Afolabi, said nobody should be left stranded because they did not have pharmacists in their network. A statement on Sunday said Afolabi spoke during the inauguration of an online integrative marketplace, Pharmacentre. According to her, the platform will enable licensed medical professionals to sell quality medical products to businesses and consumers. She noted that studies showed that over 253,000 deaths happen yearly in the country due to insufficient access to quality healthcare, adding that many of the victims were causalities of inadequate health systems and lack of access to medicine. Afolabi said, “Since the COVID-19 pandemic, however, major disruptions have visited pharmacy markets globally, through the power of technology and online commerce in a bid to facilitate easier and safer access to drugs, for all. As such, getting medicine online affords consumers the benefit of quick, easy, convenient and private access to medical needs with the click of a mouse. “As affordability and accessibility to pharmaceutical supplies when needed, in Nigeria, has become a strong point, having a value-driven platform like  Pharmacentre that enhances collaboration among pharmacists and other healthcare providers will improve the well-being of our nation and nobody should be left stranded because they do not have a pharmacist in their network.”  Copyright PUNCH.
