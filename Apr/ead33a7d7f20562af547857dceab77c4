The United States in collaboration with the Imo State Government has sensitised residents on the importance of COVID-19 vaccination. The United States Chargé d’Affairesn Nigeria, Kathleen FitzGibbon, disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday. FitzGibbon, during her visit to the state to observe the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination exercise, supported by the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention through its implementing partner, the Catholic Caritas Foundation of Nigeria, stated, “We need to reiterate the need for all eligible persons to come out and receive their vaccinations which are being offered free of charge; doing so will not only keep the individuals safe but also protect their families and communities. “I want to encourage the people of Imo State to not be complacent despite the seeming relaxation of COVID-19 prevention protocols around the world, especially in the face of several variants circulating and potentially new and emerging variants. I also applaud those who presented themselves to get vaccinated and urged them to encourage members of their families and communities to do the same. “The sooner a significant percentage of the population is vaccinated against COVID-19, the sooner we can end the pandemic and return to normal.” The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Prosper Success, urged people with underlying health conditions to get vaccinated against COVID-19. “We want to encourage people with underlying conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, immuno-compromised states, and respiratory illnesses to get vaccinated against COVID-19 because they are more vulnerable to severe illnesses or even death from COVID-19,” he stated.
