GLENWATER has introduced Whistle App to reduce daily hazards on Nigerian roads. The General Manager, Glenwater, Temitope Hundeyin, said this during Whistle App virtual launch He said, “Whistle is a mobile app that utilises crowd sourced information to achieve several key things such as report dangerous vehicles and dangerous driving; report traffic congestion and get the appropriate authorities to clear bottlenecks; report accidents to secure aid for accident victims and ensure the road is clear for smooth traffic; flag vehicles driving with expired paperwork and instantly notify authorities to issue fines where applicable.” He said Whistle was introduced to address some of the daily frustrations faced by Nigerians while going about their daily lives. “We looked at the issue of constant hazards on our roads, the incessant traffic and other various social problems that affect our quality of life and we developed a solution that relies on the power of everyday Nigerians to collaborate to make an impact,” he said. He said the app users were described as whistlers and that every report submitted by a whistler was backed by picture or video evidence and then seamlessly escalated to the appropriate authorities to provide a resolution. “Part of what makes Whistle unique is that we have integrated a virtual wallet into the app that houses the rewards whistlers receive for filing reports,” he said. He explained that this meant that for reporting a vehicle driving with expired papers, the whistler would earn a share of the fine paid.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
