IN a bid to discover talents in creative arts, a Non-Governmental Organisation, the SASTOMA Empowerment Foundation,  has organised an academic reality show for secondary school pupils in South-West. The organiser placed down a sum of N2million to the winner of the reality show to encourage the participating pupils to exhibit their innate creative potentials. Speaking at the audition of the academic reality show in Akure, the founder of SASTOMA Foundation, Dr Stella Ebuetse, explained that the reality show was meant to discover and build young creative talents and writers in secondary schools. According to her,  the reality show will encourage good communication, boost students’ confidence and serve as unifying grounds for the students to make new friends, share ideas and encourage one another to actualise their dreams and goals. Ebuetse explained that the show, sponsored by Sifax Group, was also targeting promotion and conservation of indigenous languages and cultural heritage, saying students were made to translate their audition winning poems into their indigenous languages in the final on their local costumes.
