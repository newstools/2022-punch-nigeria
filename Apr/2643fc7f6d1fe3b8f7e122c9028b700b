The International Monetary Fund has said Nigeria’s economy would grow by 3.4 per cent in 2022 in its latest world economic outlook projections. It revealed a 3.1 per cent growth projection for the nation in 2023, down from 3.4 per cent in 2022 and 3.6 per cent in 2021. Nigeria’s economic projection is lower than that of the Sub-Saharan African region, which is expected to grow by 4.5 per cent in 2021, 3.8 per cent in 2021, and 4.0 per cent. According to the Washington-based lender, the global economy is expected to grow by 3.6 per cent in 2022 and 2023 as a result of the war on Ukraine, and sanctions on Russia. It said, “Compared to our January forecast, we have revised our projection for global growth downwards to 3.6 per cent in both 2022 and 2023. This reflects the direct impact of the war on Ukraine and sanctions on Russia, with both countries projected to experience steep contractions. “This year’s growth outlook for the European Union has been revised downward by 1.1 percentage points due to the indirect effects of the war, making it the second-largest contributor to the overall downward revision.” The IMF stated that the war would slow economic growth and increase inflation.
