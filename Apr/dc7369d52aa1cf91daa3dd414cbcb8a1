The acting Governor of Kano State, Dr Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna, on Monday reaffirmed the government’s commitment to ensuring the security of the lives and properties of residents of the state. He made the assertion on Monday when a delegation of participants of the Executive Intelligence Management Course (EIMC 15) from the National Institute for Security Studies paid him a courtesy visit at the Government House. Gawuna further explained that the state government had expanded its security council to accommodate various security agencies by holding meetings regularly to access the stable situation in the state. “You are in Kano, one of the most peaceful states in the country. The state is enjoying stability, due to the concern and commitment shown by our Governor,” he said. According to Gawuna, the state government appreciated the Institute’s programmes, which were meant to enhance security in the country. Expressing appreciation for the presence of participants from other states, related agencies and other neighbouring countries, he assured of the continued cooperation and collaboration with the institute, so as to achieve the set objectives of security matters. The Commandant of the Institute, Ayodele Saheed Adeleke, said the participants, who are Deputy Directors by rank and equivalent in other services, were in Kano on a study tour to examine diverse ways in which climate change affected the state with a view to foster solutions for economic benefit, improve lives and protect the environment. While thanking the acting Governor for the reception accorded them, Adeleke pointed out that the participants during the course focused on intelligence, security, strategic and contemporary issues.
