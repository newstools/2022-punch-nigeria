The police in Rivers State have arrested one Promise Dogoh who specialised in swapping Automated Teller Machines of unsuspecting individuals and stealing money from their accounts in Port Harcourt and its environs. The state’s acting police spokesman, Grace Iringe-Koko, disclosed this in a statement made available to journalists in Port Harcourt on Tuesday. Iringe-Koko stated, “Dogoh, 23, ran out of luck when, on April 22, 2022, he successfully swapped the ATM card of a victim at an ATM gallery in Artillery, Port Harcourt. “He withdrew N 640,000, leaving the victim with nothing in his account. “The frustrated victim reported the matter to the police command who promptly got into action and arrested the culprit. “He is currently helping the police in investigation and shall soon appear in court. “The Commissioner of Police, Eboka Friday, admonishes the good people of Rivers State to be wary of strangers at ATM galleries and desist from seeking their assistance. “They should rather approach staff of the banks who can easily be identified should anything go wrong.” Copyright PUNCH.
