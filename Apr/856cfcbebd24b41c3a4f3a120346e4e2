Almeria forward, Umar Sadiq, has refused to close the door on a possible return to Roma following a stellar performance in the Spanish Segunda. In an interview with TribalFootball.com, the Super Eagles striker said he was focused on playing for Almeria, but didn’t rule out the choice of playing in Rome in once again. “Roma is my second home. I have my house there and my family,” Umar said. “Roma gives me a beautiful atmosphere and everything for me. “You never know the future. But for now, I need to remain focused on my career at UD Almeria.” Umar’s performance with Roma’s U-19 was enough to convince the Serie A giants to sign him on a permanent deal, but things didn’t go as planned for the youngster. The striker would spend the next four years on six different loan spells with Bologna, Torino, NAC Breda, Glasgow Rangers, Perugia and Partizan Belgrade, before joining Almeria in 2020. Umar spoke fondly of his time at Partizan, who signed him permanently from Roma in 2020. “Partizan is a team that remains in my heart,” Sadiq added.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
