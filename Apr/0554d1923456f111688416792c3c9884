Watford have been handed a huge boost ahead of their trip to league leaders Manchester City on Saturday with the return of Nigerian duo William Troost-Ekong and Samuel Kalu. Troost-Ekong returns to full training with the side after recovering from a slight hamstring strain that kept him out of the home clash against Brentford last Saturday. The Nigeria international has made 16 Premier League appearances this season but last featured for the Hornets in their 1-0 loss to Tottenham Hotspur at Vicarage Road on New Year’s Day. His compatriot Kalu, who joined in January from French Ligue 1 club Bordeaux, will be hoping to be part of the fold after returning from an ankle injury that kept him out against Brentford. The 24-year-old has made just two substitute appearances for the relegation-bound Hornets. Meanwhile, Brentford midfielder Frank Onyeka has intensified his recovery from a knee injury but will still be unavailable for the game against Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. The former FC Midtjylland midfielder picked up the injury while on international duty with Nigeria for the two-legged World Cup qualifiers against the Black Stars of Ghana in March. “Frank Onyeka will still be out. We hope that he will be back before the end of the season,” Brentford coach Thomas Frank had said. Frank was hopeful his namesake Onyeka will be able to return to action before the end of the season, but Saturday may well come too soon for the midfielder. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
