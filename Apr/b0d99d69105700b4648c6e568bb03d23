Lara, the wife of late entertainer and broadcaster, Gbenga Adeboye, aka Funwontan, has said she still misses him 19 years after his death. In a short interview with Saturday Beats, she said, “I miss him. Everybody misses him. May God continue to rest his soul.” Recall that Adeboye died on April 30, 2003, after battling a kidney-related ailment. The entertainment industry was badly shaken by the entertainer’s death. Adeboye was not just an actor, comedian, or ace broadcaster; he was a multitalented individual who opened the door of stardom not only to himself but to those around him. Born on September 30, 1959, in Ode Omu, Osun State, Adeboye spent a large part of his life putting smiles on the faces of people with his rib-cracking jokes. Regarded as an enigma, Adeboye combined an eclectic broadcasting talent with singing and comedy. The late comedian started making waves in the eighties as the host of a popular programme on Lagos State Broadcasting Corporation, which he tagged ‘Funwontan Oduology’. His ability to mimic several characters was loved by several fans who regularly tuned in to his radio programmes at a time before the advent of social media. Some of his nicknames were ‘Alaye Mi Gbengulo’, ‘Alhaji Pastor Oluwo’, ‘Abefe’, ‘Jengbetiele’ and ‘Itu baba Ita’. Adeboye was also believed to be a very generous and large-hearted man. Many of the broadcasters he mentored are still making waves in the industry nearly two decades after his death.  Contact: theeditor@punchng.com Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
