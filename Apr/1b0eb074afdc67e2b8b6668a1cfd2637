An All Progressives Grand Alliance’s presidential aspirant, Ms Angela Johnson, has said 2023 is the time for the country to have the first female president. Johnson, who owns UK-based Compassion Ministry, said this on Thursday at the party Secretariat in Umuahia, when she formally declared to run for president. She expressed concern that the country had not enjoyed sustainable development since the return of democratic governance in 1999. She said, “Our men, who were elected into leadership positions in the country, have failed us.
“Although they were elected to serve they end up being served by the people that elected them.” “I am being led by God to restore the hope of millions of Nigerians, who have become hopeless in the Nigerian project. “God brought President Muhammadu Buhari and sustained him in office that I shall emerge,” she said. She assured the state Chairman of APGA, Rev. Augustine Ehiemere, that he would be the first party chairman in the country to present the first female President of Nigeria. Johnson said that she had been approached to accept the Vice Presidential position by a leading political party. She said that she declined because she was sent by God to be the country’s next president. NAN
