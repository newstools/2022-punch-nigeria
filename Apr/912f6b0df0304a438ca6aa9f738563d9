Prince Harry and his wife, Megan Markle have reunited with the Queen of England, two years after stepping down as working members of the British Royal Family. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex both exited England with their son, Archie, early 2020, and relocated to the United States. Then followed their explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, where the couple detailed reasons for stepping down as senior Royals. In the interview, the couple accused an unnamed member of the Royal family of racism. While Markle, till her present visit, had not returned to England after the first exit, Prince Harry had been home twice. First, on the occasion of his late grandfather, Prince Philip’s burial in April 2021, and afterwards in June 2021 when he joined his brother, Prince William to unveil a statue of their late mother, Princess Diana at Kensington Palace. The couple who were on there way to the Netherlands for the Invictus Games, arrived in London on Wednesday and have stayed at Frogmore Cottage, their home on the grounds of Windsor Castle, Page Six reports. A spokesperson for the Sussexes also confirmed that they had met with Harry’s grandmother, the Queen, during their visit. “We can confirm that they visited the duke’s grandmother, as we previously said he hoped to do. They stopped by the UK on their way to the Hague to attend the Invictus Games,” they said. However, the couple’s children, two-year-old Archie and his sister, 10-months-old Lilibet, did not accompany their parents to the United Kingdom. Their visit comes days before the monarch will celebrate her 96th birthday. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
