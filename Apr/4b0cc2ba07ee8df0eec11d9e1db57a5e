Commercial activities were brought to a halt in Umuahia, the capital of Abia State following the ruling on a case involving the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, on Friday. It was gathered that banks and other corporate organisations did not open for business. Street traders, including food vendors, also stayed away from their shops. The trend was not different in Aba, the commercial hub of the state, where major markets did not open for commercial activities. A trader said,” I didn’t leave my house today because the market didn’t open. Kanu went to court today”. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
