Taiwo Awoniyi’s stock continues to rise after surpassing Austin Okocha to become Nigeria’s fourth top scorer in the Germans Bundesliga. Awoniyi was on target on Sunday as Union Berlin defeated Eintracht Frankfurt 2-0 at An der Alten Försterei. The striker grabbed the first goal of the encounter for the Iron Ones in the 17th minute after brushing off his marker and sweeping the ball into the right corner to fire past Jens Grahl, in goal for Frankfurt, before midfielder Grischa Proemel started a move he finished to score Union’s second goal of the game. Awoniyi thus took his Bundesliga tally for the season to 13 goals, setting a new club record for most goals in a single season in Germany’s topflight by a Union player. The previous record of 12 was set by Sebastian Andersson in the 2019/20 campaign, which Awoniyi equalled when he was on target against Cologne on match-day 28 of the 2021/22 season. The former Liverpool starlet is now the fourth highest scoring Nigerian in the history of the Bundesliga with 19 career goals, overtaking legendary Eintracht Frankfurt retired midfielder Okocha, who found the back of the net 18 times in 90 topflight appearances. Awoniyi, 24, opened his Bundesliga account in the 2019/20 season with a solitary goal that campaign in a 2-2 draw against FC Cologne. In his second season, he scored five goals and recorded three assists in 22 appearances. This year has been his best so far and he boasts a record 13 goals so far, to take his total goals in Germany’s topflight to 19. Awoniyi’s goal record is only bettered by Jonathan Akpoborie, who scored 60 goals in 144 matches, Victor Agali’s 32 and 30 goals by Anthony Ujah, Awoniyi’s teammate at Union.  Copyright PUNCH.
