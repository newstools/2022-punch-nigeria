THE National Youth Service Corps has said its Director-General, Major-General Shuaibu Ibrahim, was misrepresented in trending reports with the headline, ‘Don’t criticise Buhari, government policies on social media.’ A statement by NYSC said it was at variance with the admonitions of Ibrahim to the 2022 Batch “A” Stream Two Corps Members while addressing them at the NYSC Ondo State Orientation Camp. It read, “The attention of NYSC Management has been drawn to the above caption trending on the social media, purported to have been said by the Director-General. “Management wishes to state that the caption is very misleading, and at variance with the admonitions of the DG to 2022 Batch “A” Stream Two Corps members during an address to them at the NYSC Ondo State Orientation Camp. “The DG advised the Corps members to use the social media responsibly; in a way that will promote national unity and integration. He further counselled them to guard against the spread of fake news. “The NYSC Chief Executive never made mention of the caption alluded to him. Interestingly, the body of the report trending does not equally contain that allusion. “Management wishes to plead with reporters to avoid over sensationalism and report things that are factual so as to avoid misrepresentation of issues.” Copyright PUNCH.
