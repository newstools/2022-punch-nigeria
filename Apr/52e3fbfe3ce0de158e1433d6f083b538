The Borno Commissioner for Poverty Alleviation, Nuhu Clark, has resigned from office to contest the Chibok State Constituency election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress. Clark told the News Agency of Nigeria in an interview in Maiduguri on Monday that his decision was to ensure quality representation for the people of Chibok. Clark, who served as the elected Chairman of Chibok Local Government in 1999, said he was still connected to his people and that his project remained the people’s project. He lauded Governor Babagana Zulum for giving him the opportunity to serve as a commissioner, adding that his experience as former council chairman, state youth leader, and adviser would be brought to bear when he emerges as a lawmaker.
