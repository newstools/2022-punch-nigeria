The youth of Ichi, in the Ekwusigo Local Government Area of Anambra State, have destroyed a suspected kidnappers’ hideout in the community. The group, who stormed the camp on Sunday, also set ablaze a shrine in the area. A source said the youth took the decision to stop the activities of criminal elements in the community. The source said, “The youth seized some criminal elements in the Ichi community. These hoodlums are behind the killings and abductions of residents. The angry youths also set their shrine ablaze today (Monday).” A video circulating on social media showed the moment the group swooped on the camp on Sunday and arrested some members of the gang, who had been allegedly operating in the area and nearby towns of Oba and Ojoto. The state police spokesman, Ikenga Tochukwu, said, “I don’t have the information on this yet, please. But the command has deployed some operatives in the area to unravel what happened and maintain law and order.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
