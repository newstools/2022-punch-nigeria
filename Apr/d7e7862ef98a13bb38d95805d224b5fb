Considering the rising state of insecurity in the land, the Southern Kaduna Christian Leaders Association has inaugurated a four-man committee for this year’s Southern Kaduna Prayer Summit. The prayer summit, which was before now an annual event, failed to hold for two years due to COVID-19 restrictions. Inaugurating the committee on Wednesday in Kafanchan, shortly after a brief handover ceremony of the new leadership, the Chairman of the Association, Apostle Dr Emmanuel Nuhu Kure, tasked them to put in their best to ensure the success of the summit. He said this year’s Southern Kaduna Prayer Summit is crucial, as prayers would be offered for the restoration and emancipation of the land. Apostle Kure thanked the outgone leadership of the Association for the sacrifices they have made during their time and solicited the support of members for the new leadership to succeed. He called on members, especially the executives to rededicate themselves to the cause for the spiritual growth and development of the land and her people. PUNCH reports that the committee’s major term of reference is to ensure proper planning of the prayer summit which is billed to hold on May 28, 2022. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
