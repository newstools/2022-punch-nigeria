The Nigeria Customs Service, Ogun 1 Area Command, on Monday, said it handed over loads of cannabis sativa worth N102m seized from suspected smugglers to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency in the state. The NCS Controller, Bamidele Makinde, handed over the seized drug to the NDLEA Commander in Ogun State, Ishaku  Kwajafa, at the NCS office at Abeokuta, the state capital. Makinde said the handover of the illicit drug to the NDLEA was to further strengthen the synergy between the two agencies in the state. Speaking during the event, Makinde said the NCS would also hand over 319 sacks and over 500 wraps of marijuana to the NDLEA. He noted that the duty paid value of the seized items was N102,848,768. He said, “In line with respect for each agency’s statutory functions and in order to further strengthen the synergy between the NCS and NDLEA, the Ogun I Area Command of Nigeria Customs Service, with the approval of the Comptroller General of Customs, Col. Hammed Ibrahim Ali (rtd), hands over intercepted cannabis sativa of 319  sacks (raw), 476  wraps (book size) and 96  wraps (coconut size) with the duty paid value of N102,848,768.00 to the NDLEA, Ogun State Command, Abeokuta, Ogun State.” Responding, the NDLEA boss, Kwajafa, commended Customs for always stopping the influx of drugs into the state.
