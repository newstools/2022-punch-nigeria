Nasarawa United’s 15-year-old forward Nentaka Bangs has sent out a warning to Nigeria Professional Football League defenders that he is not scared of playing against them despite his small size and age, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Bangs made history as the youngest player ever to have featured in the Nigerian topflight at 15 years, 11 months, nine days, seven hours, and 20 minutes, when he featured for the Solid Miners against MFM in a 1-1 stalemate on March 13. Speaking after Nasarawa United’s 2-0 win over Heartland FC on match-day 21 of the 2021/22 NPFL season on Wednesday, the youngster, who already has two caps this season, said he was happy to have entered the NPFL history books. “I’m happy to have made my senior appearance for Nasarawa United and to be the youngest player ever to have featured in the league. I just want to thank the coach for believing in me and throwing me onto the pitch despite my small body size,” Bangs said. “I feel so excited playing in front of my father, who came out to watch me play, because he had never seen me play. That is the best feeling and the warm reception from the fans made me feel so happy. “As for my size, I have confidence in my ability because I have always been playing against big defenders, so I’m not afraid of the big defenders in the league. I have no fear playing against them because I believe in my ability.” Nasarawa are currently ninth on the NPFL log with 28 points after 21 games. Copyright PUNCH. Copyright PUNCH.
