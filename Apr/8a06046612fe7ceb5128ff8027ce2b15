The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Nigeria on Friday says the country as it presently stands has been gripped with “horrible state of affairs”, including killings, inflation and industrial action by the Academic Staff Union of Universities. The organisation said Nigerian were gazing at “a gloomy future that seems to promise them little or nothing.” The President of CBCN, Most Rev. Lucius Ugorji, made the assertions in his 2022 Easter message obtained from the Directorate of Social Communications, Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria, Abuja. He said, “As a nation, we are celebrating Easter this year in a rather dismal atmosphere that breathes pessimism and despair. The growing insecurity of life and property in the country is compounded by the rising wave of mindless massacres of innocent citizens from unscrupulous terrorists, causing bereavement, trauma and uncertainty. “Economic hardship with soaring inflation continues to sweep across the nation like wildfire and seems to reduce millions of our country men and women to a life of wanton suffering and distress. “The ongoing strike of ASUU is thwarting the academic ambitions of many Nigerian students. In some parts of the country, workers are owed arrears of salary, while retired senior citizens eke out existence without regular pensions. “The appalling economic condition is worsened by the present scarcity of fuel, which is as puzzling as it is frustrating. This horrible state of affairs is driving many compatriots to a feeling of cynicism as they gaze at a gloomy future that seems to promise them little or nothing.”  Copyright PUNCH.
