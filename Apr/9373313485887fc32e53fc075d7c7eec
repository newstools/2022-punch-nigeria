The opposition All Progressives Congress in Adamawa State has rejected the local government election result announced by the state independent commission which returned the candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party as the winners in all the 21 local government areas of the state. The ADSIEC Chairman, Isa Shettima, while announcing the result on Sunday, explained that the PDP swept all the chairmanship seats across the 21 LGAs in the Saturday council polls. But the APC rejected the outcome of the poll, describing it as grand theft. The Adamawa State Secretary of the APC, Dr Raymond Chidama, lamented what he called the fabrication of the poll results by the electoral umpire. He stated that the ruling party engaged in ballot stuffing in all the local government areas except in Yola North and Yola South, where there was a semblance of the election. He said, “The irregularities are so huge. The outcome of the elections is clearly a case of grand theft. We reject the elections in totality. We are going to react appropriately.” Ahead of the poll, the APC had warned that it would not condone the rigging of the poll in favour of the ruling party. The APC National Vice Chairman, North-East, Salihu Mustapha, who issued the warning said it was aware the PDP was only planning to hold the poll as a mere farce. Also, condemning the outcome of the poll, Mohammed Abdullahi, the Publicity Secretary of the APC, called the results declared by the electoral body as “fabricated”. He said, “There was no election anywhere in the state. They should just tell the people that they have generated names of PDP candidates as winners.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
