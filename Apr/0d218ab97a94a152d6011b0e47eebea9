The Catholic Bishop of Abeokuta Diocese, Dr. Peter Odetoyinbo, has lamented the rate of murder and robbery in the country, saying they were caused by the lack of mercy in the world. He disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday during the consecration of 104 Divine Mercy devotees at the annual conference held at the Catholic Church of Transfiguration, Arepo, Ogun State. Odetoyinbo stated, “I want to admonish the devotees that they are now Jesus Christ ambassadors of mercy. First is that as received from the fount of mercy, they must also care because they are devotees and as devotees they have become apostles of mercy. “The whole world can experience mercy even from their home, even from their church and among themselves who are the mercy of Jesus, because this lack of mercy is why people kill, rob and kidnap other people.” The Chairman, Divine Mercy Sunday Committee, Mr Charles Iwhewhe, expressed his appreciation to God that ever since he was appointed as chaplain, this year 116 members from across the diocese were consecrated and the consecrated apostles of mercy is the highest ever recorded in the diocese.
