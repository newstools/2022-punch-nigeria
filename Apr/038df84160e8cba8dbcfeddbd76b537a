Gunmen on Friday invaded the Isuofia Community in the Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State and reportedly killed one policeman. Aguata is the Local Government Area of the state governor, Chukwuma Soludo. It was gathered that the policeman was killed at a junction leading to the governor’s house. A source in the community who confided in our correspondent said the hoodlums stormed the area in presence of the security operatives and opened fire on them. The source said the gunmen were said to be angered by the idea of a security post stationed in the area. “The hoodlums stormed the area, shooting nonstop, while residents scampered to safety. One policeman was killed in the process,” he said. However, the state police spokesman, Tochukwu Ikenga, confirmed the attack took place but denied reports that a policeman was killed. According to him, the incident did not happen in Soludo’s community but along the expressway. He added that three policemen were wounded during the attack. “A vehicle was recovered with bloodstains showing that the hoodlums suffered causality too,” he said. Copyright PUNCH.
