The Aare Tayese of Ikenne, Chief Olanrewaju Michael George, has given reasons why he is contesting the Remo Federal Constituency seat in the House of Representatives in 2023. Addressing a mammoth crowd at the Ward 4 Secretariat, Sabo Sagamu, on Friday, OMG said that negligence of the youths, lack of basic infrastructure as well as the need to better the lots of constituents are reasons for his decision to represent the people. He said, “When you look around, you see the hopelessness on the faces of our youths from years of neglect by their elected representatives. When you look around, you can see that my people lack the basic amenities to make their lives easier. Everywhere you look, you see the glaring need for quality representation. “Residents of Remo Federal Constituency have suffered enough and as a lover of the people and someone who has, in the past five years, giving back to the society in form of empowerment, social welfare programmes, facilitation of roads amongst others, I can’t let this continue. “It is sad that when people mention Ogun State, they rubbish the efforts of our youths. We are not lazy; we have some youths doing great things globally. Anthony Joshua is from Ogun State and there are others like him. “Now is the time to harness the power of our youthful population and create a better future for them. This is why I am contesting the Remo Federal Constituency seat; to bring quality representation to our people. You deserve that.”
