A presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Rotimi Amaechi, on Thursday said his presidential ambition was borne out of the need to serve and provide selfless leadership to Nigerians. Amaechi, who is the Minister of Transportation, said considering his wealth of experience, he would be a President that would protect the interest of all Nigerians irrespective of tribe or religion. He spoke when he paid a visit to the leadership of the APC in Lagos State. He also visited the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; and the Oba of Lagos, Oba Rilwan Akiolu. The minister said, “I come with a national interest. I am 56 years old, I am energetic, I am strong and if you work with me, you will know that it is a bit difficult to get me tired. “So, because I come with that energy, it separates me from the rest of the candidates who are running with me. “I have come to talk to your conscience because it is about Nigeria. It is not about my father, it is not about my brother, it is about the nation. “We are at the point where our decisions will make the difference in moving the country forward. We are at the point where we can appeal to our conscience that our votes should count in making sure that we would not regret after the election. “So, put your votes for me. What separates me from the rest of the candidates in the party is that I am young and if you look at all of us, I come with experience.”
