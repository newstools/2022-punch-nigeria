Singers, David Adeleke, aka Davido; and Ayoleyi Solomon, popularly known as Reekado Banks, entertained fans as they played against Dutch football legend and UEFA ambassador, Clarence Seedorf, at the Landmark Event Centre in Lagos during the week. The match, which was sponsored by premium beer brand, Heineken, also involved football heavyweights such as Austin ‘Jay Jay’ Okocha and Daniel Amokachi, as well as top officials of Nigeria Breweries. Speaking before the match, Davido stated that he wanted to showcase his other talent aside from making music. A total of 14 goals were scored during the match, with Okocha scoring five of the goals. Speaking earlier at a press conference held before the match, the Corporate Affairs Director of Nigerian Breweries Plc, Shade Morgan, said, “As we kick off this momentous event on a special day, it is to our great delight that I officially announce the 2021/2022 edition of the ‘UEFA Champions Trophy Tour’. This global event is currently going on in over 31 countries across South America, Asia, and Africa. “Our goal is to create unique and memorable experiences with fans all over the world and here in Nigeria.” On his part, Seedorf said, “We have to bring the trophy closer to people who have given us the ability to enjoy our careers. We are here to bring the dream and imaginations closer to the trophy, so that football lovers can lift the trophy like I did. It is beautiful to send this message to all fans to dream big, work hard, stay away from drugs and believe in themselves. That was why I was able to realise my dreams.”  Copyright PUNCH.
