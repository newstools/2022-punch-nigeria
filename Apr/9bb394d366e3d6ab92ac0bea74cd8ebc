A rainstorm on Monday night blew off roofs of buildings in Onitsha, Anambra State, forcing residents to seek refuge elsewhere while salvaging their property. Major roads like New and Old Market Roads, Awka, Bida, Limca, Upper Iweka, Ezeiweka Roads, among others were also flooded as a result of the downpour. The downpour wreaked havoc on the newly constructed road leading to the Federal College of Education (Technical), Umunze in Orumba South Local Government Area, Anambra State. A viral video on different social media platforms had revealed how the road,  which  was constructed only a few months ago by an unnamed federal contractor, was in a terrible state after flood swept aside its connecting bridge, leaving a gully mark across the road. A source said the downpour was the first heavy rain in the area since the completion of the road. Over 100 buildings had their roofs blown off at Okpoko, which is described as the highest slum in the South-East zone by Governor Charles Soludo. At Ezeiweka, Obosi, Nwaziki Roads in Awada and Mgbemena, the flood forcefully emptied into Okpoko, which worsened the condition of the residents. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
