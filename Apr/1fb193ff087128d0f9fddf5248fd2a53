Suspected political thugs on Wednesday evening attacked the convoy of the Social Democratic Party governorship candidate, Chief Segun Oni, at Efon Alaaye in the Efon Council area of the state. Campaign Director, Media and Publicity, Jackson Adebayo, said members and supporters of the party were attacked with guns, cutlasses, and other dangerous weapons on arrival at the town for the former governor’s consultative meetings with SDP members in the council area. This was contained in a statement signed by Adebayo and titled, “Oni escapes assassination in Efon as APC thugs attack convoy”. “Shortly after the Efon Local Government members and supporters of the SDP had converged at the venue to wait for the arrival of the party’s governorship candidate, Asiwaju Oni, the thugs started to shoot guns and attacked the SDP supporters with sticks and cutlasses. “Some supporters were badly injured and vehicles in the convoy were damaged by thugs before the arrival of a detachment of police which overpowered the thugs”. Adebayo said the attack came after the former governor had successfully toured nine local governments in the exercise which began on Monday. The Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, Sunday Abutu, who confirmed the attack, said, “Yes, the hoodlums went to the venue to disrupt the consultation process of the SDP candidate, Engr Oni, but men of the police and other security agencies were able to put the situation under control. “The police have begun investigation and arrest will be made and those behind it will surely have a case to answer,” the PPRO said.
