The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria said on Saturday that Friday’s rainfall, accompanied by fierce winds and storms, led to the blackout that crippled operations at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport on Friday. FAAN’s Acting General Manager, Corporate Affairs, Faithful Hope-Ivbaze, in a statement titled ‘Temporary power outage at MMIA’, apologised to passengers and other airport users for the disruptions caused by the blackout. The statement reads: “The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria wishes to apologise to passengers and other airport users that witnessed a temporary power outage at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, at about 2315hours yesterday (Friday), April 1, 2022. “The outage, which was as a result of yesterday’s (Friday) rain that came with very fierce winds and storms, a natural occurrence, affected one of our feeders and consequently resulted in the temporary disruption of power supply at the D wing of the airport.” The statement noted that FAAN’s technicians, with the help of some officials of the power distribution company, were able to restore power to the affected wing of the terminal.
