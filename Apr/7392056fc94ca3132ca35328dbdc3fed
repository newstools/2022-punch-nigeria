A Nigerian-owned commercial airline, AZMAN air scheduled to convey passengers to Saudi Arabia, was on Friday partly gutted by fire. According to our sources, within the airport vicinity, the aircraft scheduled for Jeddah, Saudi Arabia was about to take off from the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport, when the incident occurred.
