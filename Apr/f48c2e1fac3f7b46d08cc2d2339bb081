A non-governmental organisation, Familyhood Foundation, has called for partnerships and funding from governments and corporate organisations to reach more targets with its advocacy programmes. Speaking during a programme in Lagos, Chief Executive Officer,   Familyhood Foundation, Adanilola Paul, said the NGO was committed to ensuring that one million Nigerian children and one million Nigerian parents were empowered and equipped with the basic knowledge and understanding of child sex education, child sexual abuse and its prevention on annual basis. Paul explained that carrying out such task would require more funding and partnerships with governments, financial institutions, manufacturers, and other real sector operators. He also said the group was planning to carry out its advocacy programmes in more states across the country to enable them to reach more students and parents. “What is holding us back now is just the finance. We have the human capacity, and we train our people to do sensitisation and counseling of children and parents on other programmes. If a child is abused in a family, that child has to be taken out of that family, otherwise the abuse will continue. At-risk children also need to be taken out of that environment to save lives,” he said. The Director, Guidance and Counseling Unit, Education District II, Maryland, Lagos, Olori Kalejaye, said  Familyhood Foundation brought very vital topic to the students adding that the NGOs took their time to ensure that students understand the topic.
