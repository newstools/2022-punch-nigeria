A wire fraud suspect, Adedunmola Gbadegesin, was on Tuesday extradited to the United States where he was wanted in a case of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. The offences contravene Title 18, US Code, Section 1349 and 1956 (h), and carry a maximum jail term of 20 years. His extradition was coordinated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, following a request from the office of the Attorney General of the Federation, pursuant to a February 11, 2022 order by Justice D. Osiagor of the Federal High Court, Lagos, in Suit No. FHC/L/CS/765/2. The court granted a request to extradite the suspect to the US to answer criminal charges bordering on romance scam, wire fraud and money laundering. A statement on Wednesday by the EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, said Gbadegesin, who was arrested on September 2, 2021, was alleged to have defrauded an American lady living in Kentucky, of over $148,000. “Upon arriving in the US, the suspect is billed to appear before a United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, where two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering have been filed against him,” the statement disclosed.
