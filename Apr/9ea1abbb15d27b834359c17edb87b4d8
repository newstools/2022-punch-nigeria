An Edo State High Court sitting in Auchi has sentenced a 20-year-old man, Sufiyan Ahmed, to 21 years in prison for the sexual assault and murder of a four-year-old girl. The offence was committed in Egbetua Quarters in Ososo, Akoko-Edo Local Government Area, on April 21, 2019. Delivering the judgment on a two-count charge of defilement and murder, Justice Philip Imoedemhe, said the evidence tendered convinced the court beyond a reasonable doubt that the convict was guilty of the offence. Imoedemhe said, “The evidence before me shows the defendant is guilty as charged and convicted to 21 years in prison,” ordering that the convict be taken to the Auchi correctional centre to serve his jail term. The prosecutor, Lauretta Asaka, told the court that the offence was punishable under Section 401 of the Administration of Criminal Justice, Laws of Edo State 2016. Reacting to the judgment, the victim’s uncle, Yakubu Tijani, said he was thankful for getting justice for the victim. “I am so grateful for the success of this case which has finally got justice today,” Tijani said. Also speaking, the Executive Director, BraveHeart Initiative, Ms Priscilla Usiobaifo, who welcomed the judgement, said, “The conviction brings to rest a three-year struggle for justice for a girl that was gruesomely assaulted and murdered.”  Copyright PUNCH.
