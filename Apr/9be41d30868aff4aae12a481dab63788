A gang of armed men on Thursday razed the Nnewi South Local Government Area secretariat at Ukpor, Anambra State. A security officer in the complex and another unidentified person were said to have lost their lives in the incident. A resident, Chigozie Nwajiaku, said the attack might be the handiwork of some hoodlums in the area. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Tochukwu Ikenga, confirmed the incident. He said, “The report we received was that there was a case of arson. Unknown persons set some buildings at the secretariat complex on fire. Already, men of the fire service have mobilised to the area to put out the fire. “Police operatives have also been deployed to cordon off the secretariat. People should go about their normal business as normalcy has returned to the area.” He could not confirm if there were casualties in the incident. Meanwhile, the Anambra State Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, accompanied by the state Commissioner of Police, Echeng Echeng, and other heads of security agencies, visited the scene on Thursday. The governor, who condemned the attack, described it as mindless and unfortunate. Soludo said his heart bled with the destruction of key buildings in the local government, as the education office, works department and the traditional rulers’ building on the premises were torched. He assured that acts of criminality and lawlessness would not continue in the state, just as he urged security agencies to go after the criminals and make them face the law. Copyright PUNCH.
