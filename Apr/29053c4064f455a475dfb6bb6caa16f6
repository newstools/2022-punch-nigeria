According to a statement signed by the Director of Public Relation and Information, Air Commodore, Edward Gabkwet, the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, has commiserated with families, friends, and colleagues of the deceased. The Air Force said, “The unfortunate incident of yesterday’s trainer aircraft crash is yet again a tragic reminder of the perilous nature of the military flying profession as well as the risks NAF pilots continually take, daily, to secure Nigeria’s territorial integrity. Kindly bring this information to the awareness of the general public. Thank you.” The Chief of Air Staff who paid a visit to Kaduna stated that the Air Force will investigate the cause of the crash that occurred. He had earlier constituted an Accident Investigation Board upon receiving the news of the crash, to determine the immediate and remote causes of the crash.
