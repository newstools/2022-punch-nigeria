Pam Jang, the son of a former governor of Plateau State, Jonah Jang, has declared his intention to represent the people of Jos-South/Jos-East Federal Constituency in the National Assembly. Some friends and associates of the former governor’s son, led by Dr Dagwom Gyang, who purchased the Peoples Democratic Party form for the position, presented it to him at a brief ceremony in Jos, on Tuesday. Gyang stated, “We saw the enduring legacies left by your father (Jonah Jang) when he was the governor of Plateau State and as his son, we know that you are a good man and will do the same thing and even better in governance position. “That is why we decided to purchase the form for you to go and represent the people of Jos-South/Jos-East Federal Constituency at the National Assembly.” Jang, who expressed surprise at the action of the people said, “I sincerely thank you all for this honour which I consider a privilege. It is a common fact that our people are in dire need of genuine and effective representation in the green chambers that should be defined by results, not attributes and making speeches or being liked. “As I humbly accept this clarion call to save my great people of Jos-East/Jos-South Federal Constituency in the National Assembly, I wish to state clearly that I believe in the concept of effective representation and I do not see this contest as a do-or-die affair because leadership and power come from God. “I know that the work of a legislator is not an easy one considering the present state of the nation and a constituency like ours in Jos-East/Jos-South, but I’m confident that by the grace of God, we will do our best.” Copyright PUNCH.
