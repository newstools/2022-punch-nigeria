The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics has threatened to shut down all polytechnics in Nigeria next week if the Federal Government fails to meet up with its demands. The union said this as the one month ultimatum it gave to the FG would lapse next week Wednesday. The National Executive Council of ASUP had, in March at the end of its 102 NEC meeting in Yola, Adamawa State, issued one month ultimatum to the FG. Arising from its emergency congress on Thursday, which was held at the Abraham Adesanya Polytechnic, Ijebu Igbo, Ogun State, the ASUP Zone C, which comprises the South West region and Kwara State, insisted that the Federal Government must meet up with its demands before expiration of the one month ultimatum. Addressing journalists, the Zonal Coordinator, Yekini Asafe, said ASUP had suspended its 61-day long industrial action on June 10, 2021, following the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the government. Asafe, who was flanked by the Zonal Secretary, Quassim Atolabi, and other branch chairmen, said due to the failure of the government to meet the union’s demands, it may be forced to resume the suspended industrial action. He said the NEC meeting scheduled for Abuja on May 4 was to make the decision. According to him, some of items under the union’s demands include; the non-release of the revitalisation funds for the sector, non-release of arrears of the new minimum wage, and non-release of the reviewed nomination instruments for institutions and managements as well as programmes accreditation among others.
