An early morning fire which engulfed the Iyana-Iba Market, Lagos State, on Sunday, destroyed goods and property estimated at millions of naira. PUNCH Metro gathered that the fire started from one of the shops before spreading to others. The Director of the Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service, Margaret Adeseye, who confirmed the incident in a statement, said emergency responders salvaged the situation. Adeseye noted that there was no record of death or injuries. The statement read, “The fire was reported at 7am through a run in call by two motorcyclists who besieged the nearby Ojo Fire Station and subsequently mobilised with them to the scene before the arrival of back-ups to eventually compliment in putting out the raging fire. “The inferno, which was met well alight and had done damage, was, however, curtailed from wreaking further havoc to remaining shops and adjoining property. “The cause of the fire is still being investigated and will be made known once ascertained. “There was no reported case of injury or death, but that of restiveness by some unscrupulous elements who wanted to take advantage of the fire to loot. But officers of the Nigerian Army from the Nigerian Military Cantonment, Ojo, did well to save the situation.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
