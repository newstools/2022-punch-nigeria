Insurance FC of Benin, on Saturday night, maintained its hold on the second position of the Nigeria National League after a 2-1 victory over Giant Brillers FC of Enugu in Benin City. The Benin club are campaigning in Group B1 of the NNL with 21 points, behind table toppers, Gateway United. A first-half stoppage-time penalty by Tanimu Benjamin and an own goal in the 67th minute ensured Bendel Insurance picked maximum points. Idoko Mathew scored the visitors’ consolation goal in the 86th minute with a shot from the edge of the 18-yard box. Giant Brillers FC handler, Suleman Hafeez, noted that Insurance deserved to be in the Premiership. He said, “We lost against a team who should be in the Nigerian Premiership; it is that simple. Their style of play is more superior and their organisation is standard. “We want to win away games, but today we lost to a better team, so we will go back and re-strategise.” On his part, assistant coach of Insurance, Stanley Osaze, said, “We are still on course to gain promotion and we have done well so far. “The first half of the season is coming to an end and there are a lot of matches to play in the second half. We have lost just one game and I am sure we will meet our target. “Today’s (Saturday) match was a tough one, our opponents are not pushovers. They are well-placed on the table, we really had to fight hard to get those goals and we will continue doing our best to win.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
