It was in the news earlier in the year how Workbay Technology Limited, owner of “The Maverick Gbagada Estate” raised a $2m infrastructure fund. Apparently, Workbay wasted no time at all in putting the investors’ money to work. It has commenced work on its infrastructure as laid out for the estate. The Maverick Gbagada is tipped to be one of the most beautiful estates on the mainland. It is a 60 serviced plot estate and will have the following amenities: The CEO, Gbenga Aiyeremi spoke briefly on why they moved to site within weeks of raising the fund. He has this to say “I understand that real estate sector and trust are inseparable; and trust can easily be strained when there are unnecessary dilly dallies. So in order to continue to earn the trust of our investors and land owners, we need to finish up the estate and make it habitable in record time. This will encourage those who want to own a piece of the estate to also come on board”.  Sola Adeyeye, the Co-CEO also has this to say; “It is unfortunate that there are several stories of developers promising infrastructure and not delivering them. This is taking a negative toll on the industry. We are doing our best to change this narrative. Hence the reason we want to ensure we deliver the estate infrastructure as quickly as possible with the highest quality.” “The on-going selling price is N45m per plot measuring 500sqm with payment plan that can allow buyers spread payment for up to 12months. And we have very few plots still available for sale as we have earmark about 10 plots to build housing units. We will make announcement regarding its off-plan sales starting in the coming weeks. Agents willing to work with us are welcomed” added Gbenga.
