The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress and presidential aspirant, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has called on the youths to change Nigeria’s story and desist from lamenting on the past. Tinubu spoke on Saturday during a rally organised by youths, under the aegis of Progressive Youth of South-West, to support his presidential bid in Onikan, Lagos. He added, “We as a nation can conveniently feed ourselves by being creative, visionary and committed. We cannot continue the lamentation of the past. We cannot continue with excuses of power failure. No nation made rapid development without electricity. Give us power and if we cannot be successful then you can abuse us; you cannot give us an erratic power supply that is undependable and then blame us again that we are lazy. “Nigeria, it is about time. We have enough gas to generate electricity and supply the rest of Europe and make money. You know it. We don’t want to bore you with it. When I started (as governor of Lagos State), we used to pick bodies on the streets. Today, Lagos is one of the cleanest, most progressive states in the country.” Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, in his address, appreciated the support for Tinubu, as he enjoined delegates in the forthcoming primary to exercise their franchise wisely. The state youth leader, Dr Muritala Seriki, applauded the achievements of Tinubu whom he described as a detribalised Nigerian. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
