Kelechi Iheanacho is delighted to have scored his fourth career goal against Manchester United, Sunday PUNCH reports. The Nigerian who made his ninth start of the Premier League campaign stooped low to head in a brilliant James Maddison cross at the far post to hand the Foxes the lead in the 63rd minute. But Manchester United who were missing an ill Cristiano Ronaldo, levelled scores through Fred who fired in from close range after Kasper Schmeichel had palmed a Bruno Fernandes shot into his path. “It was a good performance from us,” Iheanacho told LCFC after the game. “Were not that good from the start though but in the second half, we dominated the game and kept them running till the end of the game we made us create more chances. “We wanted to win the game but getting a draw at Old Trafford isn’t a bad result but it is extra pleasing to score against United and hopefully more to come.” Iheanacho has made 20 EPL appearances this season scoring three times. The Nigeria international was replaced in the 90th minute for Patson Daka. He has now scored seven goals and made nine assists in 33 appearances for the Foxes in all competitions for the Foxes this season. Iheanacho is expected to keep his place when Leicester City face PSV in Thursday’s quarter-final first leg Europa Conference League clash at the King Power stadium.
