Scores of women from Umuoma-Nekede in the Owerri West Local Government Area of Imo State, on Saturday, marched round the community in protest. The women, who were adorned with white and black attire, were protesting against the high level of drug-related activities in the community and its environs. Clutching placards with various inscriptions, which conveyed their message, the women asked the state government to arrest and prosecute those dealing in drugs in the community. The woman leader of the community, Ijeoma Azike, who spoke to our correspondent during the march, said the women of the community took a decision to declare war against drugs after their 2022 Easter conference. She said the development was hampering the development of the community and affecting the sanity of youths, who had taken to drugs. Singing and dancing with their musical equipment, the women asked the drug dealers to vacate their community. Azike stated, “We are protesting around our community against drugs, be it Mpurummiri, Indian hemp and others. Whether you are a dealer or a consumer, we don’t want you again. If you are a tenant, please leave our community. If you are our son, stop because you will have the women of Umuoma to contend with. “These drugs are making our sons useless. This is the decision we took after our 2022 Easter conference. We don’t want Igbo (hemp), Mpurummiri, guzuro and other drugs in our community again. The government should help us in this campaign. We want the best for our children. We want the best for our community.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
