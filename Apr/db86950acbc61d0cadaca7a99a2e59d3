After missing out of Villarreal’s 2-0 defeat to Levante in the Spanish league on Saturday, Nigeria international Samuel Chukwueze remains doubtful for the Yellow Submarines Champions League clash against Bayern Munich at the Estadio de la Ceramica on Wednesday. Unai Emery’s side’s hope of playing European football next season suffered a major blow after suffering a defeat at the Ciudad Stadium in Valencia. Chukwueze, 22, suffered an injury against Ghana in the first leg of the 2022 World Cup play-off at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi on March 25. He was replaced after 60 minutes, with Watford attacker Emmanuel Dennis taking his place. The winger didn’t return for the second leg at the Moshood Abiola Stadium in Abuja, which ended 1-1 as the Black Stars sealed their World Cup place in Qatar later this year. The 2017 U-17 World Cup winner has not been ruled out of the encounter against the Bavarians with the former Arsenal manager only confirming over the weekend that he would only miss the league game against Levante. “He (Chukwueze) will not be available to play Levante due to a small muscle injury,” Emery said in his pre-match interview. Villarreal hold their last training today to determine if the former Diamond Academy product will be available for the Champions League game. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
