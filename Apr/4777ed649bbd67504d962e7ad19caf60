Shola Ogudu, the mother of singer Wizkid’s son, Boluwatife, has narrated what she was told about the “immoral act” engaged in by students of Chrisland Schools, Lagos. The incident happened when the students travelled to Dubai to participate in the World School Games from March 10 to 13. Ogudu said her son described the video as disgusting, claiming that the female student involved didn’t immediately know the implication of her action. She also urged parents to pay close attention to their children while narrating what she heard via her Instagram handle, @O.Oluwashola. She posted, “I accompanied my son to represent his school at the just-concluded WSG. “I remember vividly the ‘shock’ in my son’s face when he was telling me about a video some other kids were watching. He said mum, ‘I couldn’t stand the video I had to excuse myself’. He said the gist circulating was that the girl and her click played a game of truth or dare, of which this particular girl couldn’t stop with the mind bugging dares. I couldn’t believe my ears when I learned about the nasty activities these little kids get themselves involved in. “To make matters worse, even when she was accosted about the video, she was owing to it with her full chest.” Shola also cautioned against blaming the school and teachers for the “immoral act”, saying parents also have a role to play in a child’s uprightness.
