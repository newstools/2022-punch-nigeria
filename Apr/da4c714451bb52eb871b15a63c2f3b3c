The Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Friday picked the All Progressives Congress governorship nomination and expression of interest forms. The forms were picked at the APC’s National Secretariat in Abuja by a member of the House of Representatives, representing Ikeja Federal Constituency, Hon. James Faleke. Faleke was accompanied by former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Babachir Lawal, and hundreds of members of the Tinubu Support Groups to the party’s secretariat. The governorship expression of interest and nominations forms were presented to Governor Sanwo-Olu at the Lagos Governor’s Lodge, Asokoro, Abuja by the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Mr. Tayo Ayinde. Recall that Governor Sanwo-Olu was unanimously endorsed a few days ago for a second term shot by the Lagos APC apex leadership body, Governance Advisory Council. Meanwhile, political leaders and businessmen from Ogun West Senatorial District of Ogun State have donated the sum of N50m to the state governor, Dapo Abiodun, to assist in his campaign expenses for the second term in office. The governor had on Thursday declared his intention to run for a second term while hosting the DA Mandate Group from Remoland, which presented him a cheque of N50m to purchase his nomination form. Presenting the cheque on behalf of the Ogun West group to Abiodun, on Friday, at his Oke Mosan Governor’s Office, Otunba Akeem Adigun said the gesture was borne out of love the people of the district have for the governor, particularly the brilliant way he is executing projects across the state.
