Nigerian investigative journalist, Fisayo Soyombo, has emerged a 2022 fellow of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford, United Kingdom. Soyombo, the founder of the Foundation for Investigative Journalism, is one of the 13 fellows selected worldwide to participate in the six-month fellowship programme at the Reuters Institute. This was contained in a statement obtained by The PUNCH. In a letter to fellows, Director of the Journalism Fellowship Programme, Meera Selva, said, “The field was incredibly strong this year so congratulations on being chosen! We greatly look forward to welcoming you here in Oxford in the next academic year.” As part of the fellows for this year, Soyombo would research on “the rise of a willing army against the truth — the practice of drowning out a genuine work of journalism with coordinated media campaigns that confuse unsuspecting members of the public, consequently leaving the authenticity of the story in tatters”. As an investigative journalist, Soyombo has received various awards and recognitions, both locally and internationally. The three-time winner of the Wole Soyinka Award for Investigative Reporting has won other international awards including Karpoor Chandra Kulish International Award for Excellence in Journalism, 2020 Kurt Schork Awards in International Journalism, and a plethora of others. Soyombo founded FIJ, an independent, not-for-profit organisation, in late 2020, where he also doubles as the Editor-in-Chief. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
