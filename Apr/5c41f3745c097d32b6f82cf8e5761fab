He spoke at the National Convention of the People Redemption Party held in Abuja. “Our government at the at the state, local and federal level have long abandoned governance,” he said. “And no country can develop without good governance, without good people driving good governance. “So I urge us to go back and realise that the work ahead of us is a lot; it may even seem difficult, but it is not impossible to do it.” PRP re-elected Alhaji Falalu Bello as its National Chairman. Other members of the party’s National Executive Committee elected include National Secretary, Babatunde Alli; and National Treasurer, Dr Abdullahi Bayawo, among others. In his acceptance speech, Bello appreciated the party for electing them to serve, pledging their commitment to the party and the nation.

He said that with unity, the new Electoral Act and recent innovations by the Independent National Electoral Commission, PRP had the potential to win the presidential and more elections in the 2023 general elections. He urged members to embark on a membership drive across the nation, disclosing that the party would soon roll out its guidelines for the 2023 general elections.
