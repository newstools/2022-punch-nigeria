Police have arrested the embattled former chairman of the Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission, Muhuyi Rimingado, in Abuja. Rimingado was arrested at the Sokoto Governor’s Lodge in Abuja, where he went for screening as Kano governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party. The Public Relations Officer of the Kano State Police Command, SP Abdullahi Haruna, confirmed the arrest of the former anti-graft agency boss in a telephone interview in Kano. “Yes, it’s true that Muhuyi was arrested at the Sokoto Governor’s lodge in Abuja,” Haruna said. It was gathered that the cops whisked him away immediately after his screening and took him to the Federal Capital Territory  Command. The police had on March 28, 2022, laid siege to Rimingado’s residence in Kano but failed to arrest him. Rimingado was suspended in July 2021 after opening a probe on financial scandals and inflated contracts allegedly awarded to some companies linked to the governor’s family. On March 1, 2022, a Federal High Court sitting in Kano dismissed an ex parte application filed by Rimingado seeking to stop an investigative panel instituted by the Kano State House of Assembly and restrain the police from investigating, arresting or intimidating him, pending the hearing and determination of subsisting court action instituted at state high court.
