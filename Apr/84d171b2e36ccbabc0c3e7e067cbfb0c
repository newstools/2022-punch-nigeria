Nigerian winger, Anthony Nwakaeme, may dump Trabzonspor for rivals Fernabahce after turning down the club’s offer over disagreement on financial details in the deal, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Nwakaeme has been one of the club’s best players since joining the side in the 2019/19 season from Israeli side Hapoel Be’er Sheva scoring 44 goals while providing 40 assists in 141 appearances for the club. He has also found the back of the net 12 times while providing 11 assists in 32 games across all competitions this season. According to reports from Turkish website,.trhaber.com, the Nigerian seems to have agreed personal terms in principle with the Turkish giants. It was reported that Fenerbahce have offered the Nigerian star a signing fee of €1.5m and a three-year contract of €2.75m per year. Nwakaeme had requested that Trabzonspor pay him €1.8m in cash and €3m per year in return for a two-and-a-half  year contract which the club rejected. The news of the Nigerian joining the club’s rivals has not gone down well with Trabzonspor president Ahmet Ağaoğlu. It is expected that the club will return to the negotiation table with Nwakaeme who has become a cult hero at the club. The 33-year-old will see his contract at the club expire on June 30.
