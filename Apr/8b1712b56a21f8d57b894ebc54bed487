THE First Lady of Lagos State, Dr Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, has said N750 million was approved by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu from the equity fund to pay for the health insurance premiums for 100,000 vulnerable and indigent residents of the state. Sanwo-Olu disclosed this on Wednesday during a town hall meeting with the beneficiaries of the health insurance equity fund organised by the Lagos State Health Management Agency in Lagos. The governor’s wife, who was represented by the wife of the state’s Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mrs Funmi Omotoso, stated that the equity fund would ensure that a sizeable proportion of the population who could not afford health insurance premiums were not left behind. She said, “Through this effort, the government provides financial protection to the poor when they seek healthcare services to boost their purchasing capacities and stimulate economic growth. The Ilera Eko equity fund is part of the effort by the state government to provide social protection to the poor. “Since the inception of this administration, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has approved the payment of over N750m which has been used to pay the health insurance premiums of 100,000 residents of the state. “In the short term, this has facilitated access to healthcare by a group of people who cannot afford to go to the hospital and, in the long term, will improve the health outcomes in the state.”  Copyright PUNCH.
