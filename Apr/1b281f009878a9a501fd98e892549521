Pepsodent is set to educate one million Nigerian children on the importance of oral health in 2022. A statement quoted the Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Director, Unilever West Africa, Soromidayo George, as saying this during a press conference in Lagos. He added that the firm had educated about five million school children so far. He said, “In a demonstration of our commitment to improving oral hygiene in Nigeria, Pepsodent has reached over five million school children by educating them on the importance of brushing twice daily and creating a 21-day routine for them to develop a habit of brushing first thing in the morning and the last thing at night. “Free Pepsodent toothpaste and toothbrushes were given to the children to help facilitate their brushing habits.” Also speaking, the Category Manager, Oral Care, Eva Ogudu, said the firm, in partnership with Nigerian Dental Association, would have mobile dental clinics in specific neighbourhoods across the country. Ogudu added, “In addition to our mobile dental clinic initiative for this year, there would be an online digital activation through Instagram live videos tagged ‘Ask Your Dentist’ which would be launched on March 20, 2022, to provide consumers direct access to a dentist to ask their dental related questions. “Through these initiatives we aim to help millions of people take control of their oral health and avoid severe pain, costly and complicated treatments, and ultimately tooth loss through these services which would run yearly.” Copyright PUNCH.
