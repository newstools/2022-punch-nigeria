THE Lagos State Police Command has confirmed the arrest of four suspects over alleged possession of illicit drugs said to be worth N10m in the Mile 2 area of the state. Confirming the development in a statement on Sunday, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin, said the suspects were arrested by operatives of the Rapid Response Squad. He said, “Operatives of the Rapid Response Squad in the early hours of Sunday, April 3, 2022 intercepted a busload of illicit drugs at the Mile 2 area of Lagos State. “Preliminary investigations revealed that the drugs which were loaded in a bus with the number plate AGL 205 YD belonged to one Alhaji, better known as General in Mushin. “A member of the drug syndicate confessed that they picked up the consignment, which has a street value of about N10, 000,000, at Alaba Rago around 10pm yesterday (Saturday) for shipment to Mushin.” Hundeyin stated that luck ran out on the suspects when RRS officials on patrol stopped the bus for a routine check around 4am. He added, “Another member of the syndicate, Oluwole Omojuyitan, 40, who had initially escaped the scene on bike was arrested by the operatives after he returned with N500, 000 to bribe the officers to release the drugs and suspects. “Other arrested members of the gang include Ojukwu Omanogho, 36, and Hope Jumbo, 40. The Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi, while commending the Commander RRS, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi, and the team, has since directed that the suspects and exhibits be transferred to the command headquarters for further investigations.”  Copyright PUNCH.
