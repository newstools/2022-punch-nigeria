The Nigeria Football Federation and the Federación Ecuatoriana de Fútbol Friday announced that the ‘A’ National Teams of both countries will play a friendly match in New Jersey, United States of America June 2. Both teams will clash at the 25,000-capacity Red Bull Arena in Harrison, New Jersey – home to Major League Soccer’s New York Red Bulls. The match comes only five days after three-time African champions Super Eagles would have squared up against Mexico’s El Tri, one of the strongest teams in the CONCACAF region, in another prestigious international friendly match at the AT & T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Ecuador, currently ranked 46th in the world, reached the Round of 16 at the 2006 World Cup in Germany (their second appearance at football’s high table, following their debut in the Far East in 2002). Nigeria have participated at the World Cup finals on six occasions, reaching the Round of 16 in 1994, 1998 and 2014. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
