The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), has not resigned. His Media Assistant, Umar Gwandu, made this known in a statement on Thursday night. According to Gwandu, Malami remained committed to discharging statutory obligations and constitutionally delineated responsibilities in accordance with the provisions of extant laws. The PUNCH had earlier reported that Malami, on March 17, 2022, said he won’t resign from office, noting that he will end his tenure gloriously by May 2023. “There is naturally an end to everything. My tenure in office has not yet ended. I pray for a glorious end,” he had said. Malami, 54, has been a prominent member of the cabinet of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), since 2015. He is said to be highly regarded by the President who reportedly seeks his legal advice on major national matters. Buhari’s high estimation of Malami was confirmed last year when the President during an interview refused to “contradict his attorney general”. The Kebbi State indigene was recently rumoured to be interested in succeeding Governor Abubakar Bagudu but Malami’s aide (Gwandu), in a statement, said his principal was yet to declare interest in any elected office in 2023.
