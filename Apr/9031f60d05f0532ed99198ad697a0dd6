A Gospel singer, Saint Next, is of the opinion that though some churches support gospel musicians, more needs to be done because of how much can be achieved through music. In an interview with Sunday Scoop, he said, “I am of the opinion that some churches are doing pretty well as regards supporting gospel artistes. However, the body of Christ (the church), needs to do more. The only thing that is constant in life is change, so I want to appeal to the church to give more support to gospel artistes, so as to reach more people on the streets and shine the light of God everywhere. Music is powerful and it is a universal language that everyone understands, so the church can use such a platform to further spread the word of God.” Speaking on his forthcoming album titled, Grass 2 Grace, the singer said, “I am currently working on my album titled, Grass 2 Grace. It is a 16-track album that everyone would love. Each of the songs talks about different things, such as God, gratitude, and how a man like me rose from a state of obscurity to the limelight. There is a particular track that talks about love. I believe everyone out there, irrespective of their religion, will love the song because we all need love.  I believe the album will appeal to all because of the message it carries. It is produced by Geamat and I can’t wait to share it with my fans.” Saint Next also stated that he had no qualms collaborating with a secular artiste. He said, “I will most definitely collaborate with any artiste with positive content that aligns with my brand. We (gospel artistes) must spread the message of light to all and God can use any person to achieve this in a positive way. The ultimate goal is to spread positive content.” Copyright PUNCH.
