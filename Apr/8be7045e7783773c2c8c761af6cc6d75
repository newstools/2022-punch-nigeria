AGAIN gunmen have razed the country home of the Imo State Commissioner for Justice, Cyprian Akaolisa. His father’s house in Obibi, Awo-Idemili, Orsu Local Government Area the state was also razed. Gunmen had in 2021 burnt a part of the commissioner’s house. But on the latest attack, the invaders completely burnt the commissioner’s house and that of his aged father. The commissioner confirmed the attack on his house and that of his father in a statement on Sunday. Akaolisa accused people from the South East for being responsible for the arson on his house and that of his father’s. The statement read, “Through my many years of struggle, I have managed to put a block on another to build a befitting house for my family. My aged father also has a house he built through his sweats. “Today, both buildings are in rubbles and ashes – our fellow Igbos burnt them. “Firstly, last year, these arsonists burnt my country home in Obibi, Awo-Idemili, Orsu LGA of Imo State for no just cause. “This year again, they returned and this time, they perfected the complete burning of even the blocks/bricks. “And last night, to my utter consternation, they levelled my father’s house. This is a house my father built by himself – the life-toil of an aged man. “In other words, I wish to put on record that my family house is completely destroyed. This was after they used a truck to cart all the properties: fridges TVs, bed/foams, generator sets and other household materials. “What are my crimes, who did I offend? And what were my father’s offences?” The spokesperson for the state police command, Micheal Abattam, had yet to respond to an inquiry concerning the arson. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
