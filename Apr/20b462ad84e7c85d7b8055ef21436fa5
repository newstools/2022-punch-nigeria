Insecurity and terrorists attacks may increase before the general election in 2023, separate reports have noted. While the report by Becon Consulting said criminal activities such as kidnapping, home invasions, political violence among others were bound to happen before the 2023 elections, a  security analyst and counter insurgency expert in the Lake Chad region, Zagazola Makama, predicted  more deadly attacks by terrorists. The report by Beacon partly read, “Political violence localised to political events and gatherings will continue as preparations continue for off-cycle elections, and political party events, including party primaries for the 2023 general elections. “Criminal activities, including kidnap for ransom, violent and petty crimes, as well as home invasions, are likely to continue in the short and medium terms due to the deteriorating economic circumstances of the country. Meanwhile, Makama said, “It is predicted that more deadly attacks would be carried out before the 2023 elections being that large numbers of the terrorists have migrated to Taraba, Bauchi, Masara, Kaduna, Zamfara, Niger, Birnin Kebbi, Okene Forest, Ondo and Lagos. “JAS terrorists have already established it cells in Taraba, Nassarawa, Benue, Kaduna, Zamfara, Okene Forest in Kogi, Ore, Kontagora Forest in Niger and Lagos.
