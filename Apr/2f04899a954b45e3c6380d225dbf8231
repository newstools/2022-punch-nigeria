An Ota Magistrates’ Court in Ogun on Tuesday sentenced a 40-year-old man, Akinola Obisesan, to three months imprisonment, for snatching a handbag containing N100,000 and other valuables. The police charged Akinola with two counts of stealing and conspiracy, to which he pleaded not guilty. Magistrate A.O. Adeyemi, in her ruling, upheld that the prosecution counsel had proven beyond reasonable doubt that the convict was guilty of the charge preferred against him, and subsequently sentenced the convict to three months imprisonment with an option of N150,000 fine. The Prosecution Counsel, Insp. E.O. Adaraloye, told the court that the convict and others still at large, committed the offences on December 8, 2021, at about 8:30 pm in the Oju-Ore area of Ota, Ogun State. Adaraloye informed the court that the convict and his accomplices conspired and snatched a handbag containing cash of N100,000 and other valuables from the complainant, Ijamakinwa Folashade. He said the offence contravened Sections 390(9) and 516 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ogun, 2006. (NAN)
