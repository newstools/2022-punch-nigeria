THE Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Treasury Office, Dr Muritala Abiodun, has assured citizens of the state of improved financial service through its officers professionally trained in customer relationships. Abiodun gave this assurance, according to a statement on Saturday, during the official inauguration of the STO’s service charter initiative to provide world-class financial services to residents. He said, “The Lagos State Office of Transformation Creativity and Innovation pioneered this initiative which would make the office more responsive to its mandates to members of the public, especially the stakeholders of STO, to demand excellent services from its officers. “The motive behind the decision to have a service charter document in place at the STO was to ensure efficient financial service delivery to the internal and external and connected stakeholders of the office. “The documents were crafted putting into cognisance the provision for laws bordering on payments. The document will guide us to ensure that we always meet with the needs of our stakeholders.” The Permanent Secretary, Local Government Service Commission, Mr Biodun Bamgboye, advised STO to see the service charter document as part of efforts to serve the people. “It has become obligatory to personify the name public service; know that you are there to serve the people, and in the service charter, openness is non-negotiable, be aware, and ensure that there is free flow of information. “The world has become a global village where information has become cheap,” he said.
