The National Directorate of Employment has disbursed N3.8m to 38 youths in Kogi State to enable them to embark on sustainable agriculture. Each of them got a N100,000 loan. The loan is earmarked for the beneficiaries to embark on four agricultural schemes, namely:  Graduate Agricultural Enhancement, Community Based Agricultural Empowerment, Sustainable Agricultural Development and Agricultural Enhancement under the Rural Employment Promotion Department of the NDE in Kogi State. Aside from loan disbursement, a total of 100 unemployed youths were trained on sustainable agricultural development. Inaugurating the programme on Friday in Lokoja, the Director-General of NDE, Mallam Abubakar Nuhu Fikpo, who was represented by the state coordinator, Mallam Abubakar Zakari, described agriculture as the only sector with the potential to create mass employment for the unemployed youth in Nigeria.
