Worried by the incessant face-off between host communities and multinational oil companies operating in the Niger Delta region, the Governor of Delta State, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, on Thursday cautioned that the trend, if not checked, could lead to further divestment in the oil sector. Okowa, while inaugurating the 2.1Km Obitobon-Elolo-AjaokurreOgbo-Orubu Roads in Ogidigben and 2.3Km roads in Benikrukru, both in Warri South-West Local Government Area of the state, noted that though communities are at liberty to protest, they should guard against causing a breach of activities at oil companies. The governor, therefore, urged communities in the state to always channel their complaints against oil firms to the State Ministry of Oil and Gas for further action. The governor said, “When you make a request and your request is not met, please channel it to the Ministry of Oil and Gas and we can always find a means to intervene on your behalf. We need to handle everything with care to prevent the international oil companies from further divesting from the nation’s oil and gas sector.” “At the moment, we are operating at 60 per cent of our production quantum because many of the oil companies are beginning to withdraw their investments from the country. “But that does not mean that the oil companies would take advantage of that situation not to fulfil their obligations as stated in their memorandum of understanding with host communities.”  Copyright PUNCH.
