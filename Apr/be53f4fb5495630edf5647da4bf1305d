Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State says he is committed to allowing God’s will to prevail on the choice of who will succeed him in 2023. He said he was not willing to lord himself on the people but to allow the will of God to provide Deltans with a worthy successor as governor. Okowa stated this on Sunday at the 70th birthday service of Chief Oritsetimeyin Adams, which was held at Cathedral Church of St. Luke’s Anglican Church in the state. He said, “I thank the church and our leaders for their consistent prayers for our dear state because it is not about us, men, but about what God wants. “So, pray that whoever God wants will be governor, and may that person He wants emerge as governor for the good of Deltans. “May God’s will be done in Delta State, and may it be well with us in Nigeria.” The governor congratulated the celebrant for attaining the Biblical three scores and 10. He urged him to rededicate his life to the service of God and humanity. “God is the source of life, and therefore, we must return all thanks to Him, and that is what you have done today. “I knew Chief Adams since 1991 when we were council chairmen together; he was in the NRC, and I was in the SDP, and we became friends since then. “I thank God that today also he continued to remember the things God had enabled him to do,” he added. Earlier in his sermon, Bishop of Oleh Diocese (Anglican Communion), Rt. Rev’d John Aruakpor had said that a man’s worth did not consist of his possessions’ abundance but by the value of service he rendered to others. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
