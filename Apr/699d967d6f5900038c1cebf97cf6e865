The Special Adviser on Civic Engagement to Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State, Mr Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, said the governor will be putting his trust in God and the electorate in the state for a victorious outing during the July 12 governorship poll. He said this during an engagement meeting with the members of the Plant Caterpillar Operators Association of Nigeria, Osun chapter, organised by the state’s Civic Engagement Office in Osogbo, on Thursday, where he represented the governor. Oyintiloye said Oyetola’s faith in God regarding his re-election remained strong. He quoted Oyetola as saying that he would not be distracted by the campaign of calumny from the opposition parties ahead of the election noted that nothing would derail him from fulfilling the promises made to the citizens. “My faith in God and the good people of Osun in respect of my re-election is unshaken. I have kept the promises I made with the good people of the state, as well as the covenant I made with God to uphold my oath of office. “Victory for me and my party, the All Progressives Congress is sure because it is God that gives power and His appointment is not negotiable,” the governor was quoted as saying. Speaking further, Oyintiloye urged the electorate to protect their Permanent Voter Cards and use them to support him during the election. He noted that the chairman of the association, Mr Jimoh Taofeek, commended the governor for embarking on programmes and policies that were of great benefit to the masses. Copyright PUNCH.
