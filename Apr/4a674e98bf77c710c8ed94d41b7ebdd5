The National Board for Technical Education has expressed concern over the increasing rate of illegal private polytechnics, monotechnics as well as health institutions and technical vocational education and training institutions across the country. The board noted that some of these institutions, particularly health technological institutions, had yet to get the nod of the Federal Government to operate, adding that any certificate, degrees awarded from such institutions remained illegal. The Executive Secretary, NBTE, Prof Idris Bugaje, who made this known in a statement issued in Kaduna on Thursday, cautioned admission seekers and unsuspecting public against falling prey, adding that the development was a threat to quality education in the country. The PUNCH had reported that the board and Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission were partnering to check the operation of illegal polytechnics and monotechnics and other unapproved institutions springing up across the country. To this end, the NBTE boss called on security and anti-graft agencies to clamp down on any erring private polytechnics, college/schools of health technology and similar TVET institutions operating in the country without the Federal Ministry of Education’s approval and license. According to Bugaje, all private institutions of higher education in the country must be established in line with the provisions of the Education (National Minimum Standards and Establishment of Institutions) Amendment Act CAP E3 LFN 2004.
