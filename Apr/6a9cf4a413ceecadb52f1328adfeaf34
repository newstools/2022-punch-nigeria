Justice Adepele Ojo of an Osun State High Court 1, Osogbo, hearing the case of the alleged murder of Master’s student of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Timothy Adegoke, was forced into short adjournment on Monday following ill health of one of the defendants, Magdalene Chiefuna. Hilton Hotel owner, Dr. Ramon Adedoyin; and six of his staff, Adedeji Adesola, Magdalene Chiefuna, Adeniyi Aderogba, Oluwale Lawrence, Oyetunde Kazeem and Adebayo Kunle, had been arraigned on 11-count bordering on conspiracy, murder, altering of receipt and administration of extrajudicial oath. Justice Ojo had adjourned further hearing on the matter till April 25, after a no-case submission defence counsel entered on behalf of their clients, failed. The proceedings which started at about 9:35 am was forced into short adjournment around 9:55 am after Chiefuna, who was in the dock with the other six defendants, started coughing and slumped. Justice Ojo then rose for brief adjournment as the defendant was led out of the courtroom by prison officials. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
