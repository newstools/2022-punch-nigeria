An anonymous woman who accused American rapper, Calvin Broadus alias Snoop Dogg of sexual assault has dropped her charges against him. Identified as Jane Doe, the woman who also accused an associate of Dogg (Donald Campbell), claimed the incident happened after she attended the rapper’s concert in May 2013. According to the filings made in February, Doe stated she had requested to be driven home after being offered a ride by Campbell. Instead, she had slept off in the car and woke up in his home where he later forced her to have oral sex with him. She alleged that he afterwards urged her to accompany him to meet the rapper who was filming his TV series, The Snoop Dogg’s Double G News Network, at the time. After taping, Doe who was identified as a dancer claimed that Dogg had barged into her in the bathroom and coerced her to perform oral sex on him. Tagging it a ”shakedown”, a spokesperson for Dogg refuted the claims, stating that the rapper had never been in any sexual encounter with the said woman. Following the news, Dogg also took to his Instagram page, where he posted an image that read, “gold digger season is here” alongside emojis of a judge, a police officer, and a bag of cash. The filing of the suit made headlines just days before the rapper performed at the Super Bowl halftime show. The suit has thus been withdrawn “without prejudice” by Doe’s lawyer on Wednesday according to reports by the NBC News. The complainant, however, did not give any reasons for dropping the suit in the filing. Reacting to the withdrawal, a spokesperson for Snoop Dogg stated that it was not surprising the suit was dropped as “her complaint was full of false allegations and deficiencies”.
