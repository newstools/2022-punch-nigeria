Two passengers of a commercial bus were on Friday confirmed dead in an auto crash at the Christopher University axis of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway in the Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State. It was also learnt that 12 people suffered varying degrees of injury when the bus somersaulted while on motion on the busy road at about 1:30pm. The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps said two male passengers died out of the 18 people on the bus with a number plate marked, APP 417 XU. It said nine males and three females were injured. “The tyre burst on motion, the driver lost control and the vehicle somersaulted, according to an eyewitness,” the corps’ Public Relations Officer, Mr Babatunde Akinbiyi, added in a report on the accident. He said the agency took some of the victims to the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital while the Federal Road Safety Corps also took some victims to Idera Hospital, Sagamu. “TRACE and police were controlling the traffic while the bus (was) totally evacuated to the police cage at Redeemed. The traffic was initially affected but cleared by TRACE, FRSC and police. Outbound Lagos is free and normalcy has been restored,” he added.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
