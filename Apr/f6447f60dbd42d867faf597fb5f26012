Nigerians have taken to social media to lament the collapse of the national electricity grid which resulted in a blackout in the country. The PUNCH had reported  that the national electricity grid collapsed again on Friday evening, making it the third time the grid had collapsed within the space of one month. They lamented the recurrence of the national grid collapse despite that some of the power distribution companies had apologised for the power outage. Some of them claimed that no social amenity is working under the regime of the president, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). “It is not only the national grid that has collapsed, but it is also everything that has collapsed in Nigeria, nothing is standing,” @LekeAkoki tweeted. @AlliOlabisi added, “What has not collapsed in the past few years? Elections and voting have consequences.” @AbiodunOmole said, “Is there anything in Nigeria that hasn’t collapsed. The government, economy, security, education, health care.” @ChuckObidimma said, “Everything else is collapsing. If you are also the national grid, will you stay?” @Tosinlax  noted that “Nothing is working under this Buhari regime.” Also, electricity consumers on Saturday slammed Eko Electricity Distribution Company and Ikeja Electric Plc over the epileptic power supply being experienced in Lagos State in the past weeks, NAN reports.
