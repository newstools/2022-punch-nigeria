Men of the Anambra State Police Command have rescued herders said to have been kidnapped in Ogbaru Local Government Area of the state. The police had also said they recovered about 300 cattle, which the gunmen allegedly rustled. The South-East Chairman of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, Alhaji Gidado Siddiki, had alleged that gunmen invaded its settlement on Saturday, kidnapped 10 of its members and went away with about 300 cows belonging to the herders. He said the kidnappers asked for N10 million and a gun as ransom. However, the state police command’s spokesperson, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, in an update on the attack, on Monday, said only one herder was still with the kidnappers. Ikenga disclosed this in a press statement titled, “Update on the alleged gunmen attack on herders in Anambra State, kidnap of 10 and rustling of 300 cows”. He said, “In view of the above, the police command got into joint operation with the military. “On April 24, 2022, some of the victims were seen in the bush unharmed, while one of the abductees is still missing. The joint operatives also discovered some of the livestock in the bush. “Furthermore, efforts are being intensified to locate him (missing herder) and the livestock still missing.
