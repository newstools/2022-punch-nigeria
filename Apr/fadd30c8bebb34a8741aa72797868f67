In furtherance of its commitment to check harmful drinking, International Breweries Plc has asked its customers to drink responsibly. Speaking recently at the company’s Smart Drinking Roundtable Session, the company’s Managing Director, Hugo Rocha, noted, “Since 2018, Smart Drinking has more and more become part of our DNA and we continue to strive to bring that culture to our communities. “Our commitment extends far beyond saying ‘drink responsibly’; it spans our Global Smart Drinking Goals, the work of the AB InBev Foundation, the commitments of our brands, and the behaviour that we ask our consumers to practice every time they pick up a beer.” The event with the theme, ‘Enhancing the Social Consciousness around Responsible Beverage Service: A Collective Responsibility of Stakeholders’, brought together key stakeholders in the health, safety, transport and hospitality sectors to discuss responsible drinking. The keynote speaker and President, Society for Adolescent and Young People’s Health in Nigeria, Prof Adesegun Fatusi, said, “Raising social consciousness and actions to reduce harmful alcohol use is only possible through collaborative efforts by the government, non-governmental organisations and communities.” The Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, represented by the Director, Food and Drug Services Department in the ministry, Mrs Olubunmi Arebeana, highlighted the role of corporate organisations like International Breweries Plc in promoting responsible alcohol consumption through evidence-based initiatives.
