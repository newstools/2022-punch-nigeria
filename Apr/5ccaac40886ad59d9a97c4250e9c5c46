The Kebbi Area Command of the Nigeria Customs Service says the command made a total of 32 seizes with a Duty Paid Value of, N87, 707,985 in the month of March, 2022. The Customs Area Controller in charge of the command, Comptroller Joseph Attah, while briefing Journalists at the command in Birnin Kebbi on Wednesday, said in line with extant laws, most of the seized inflammable products have been auctioned to government agencies and the amount generated remitted to government coffers. He added that the remaining items would be auctioned immediately. “579 jerricans equivalent to 14,475 litres of Premium Motor Spirit, 45 bales of second-hand clothing, 45 bags of foreign parboiled rice of 50kg each, 320 sacks of scrap metals, two trucks used as means of conveyance, One used Ford Edge vehicle; among others” Attah said there had been a continuous decrease in the smuggling of petroleum products through the command. “Worthy of note is the fact that petrol smuggling through the command has continued to be on the decrease in the face of the sustained fight against the illicit trade. Those who thought they can use motorcycles to ferry jerricans of PMS through bush paths are counting their losses going by the activities of the command’s anti-bunkering team. The profit motive that drives smuggling is being scuttled. It is therefore reasonable for such people to embrace legitimate means of livelihood” he said.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
