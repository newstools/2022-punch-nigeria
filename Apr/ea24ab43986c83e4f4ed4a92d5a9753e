NINE students of the Federal University, Oye Ekiti, have won scholarship awards of the UNESCO International Centre for Biotechnology and the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi. The Special Media Adviser to FUOYE’s  Vice-Chancellor, Wole Balogun, said the students emerged winners of the 2022 edition of the two contests having defeated students from other institutions. Balogun, in a statement titled, ‘FUOYE students floor other Nigerian undergraduates in local, global scholarship award contests’, stated, “The feat was possible with the VC’s sights on excellence and provision of necessary facilities, amenities and equipment necessary to enable students compete favourably with their peers across the globe.” He stated that while seven students comprising six undergraduates and a post-graduate student won the UNESCO scholarships at the Nigerian National Merit Award Secretariat in Abuja on April 1, 2022, two others won the contest for the Ooni scholarship. The media adviser said the scholarship recipients, who said they were encouraged to participate in the contest by their departments, lauded the Fasina-led FUOYE management for providing enabling teaching and learning environment which prepared them for the task.
