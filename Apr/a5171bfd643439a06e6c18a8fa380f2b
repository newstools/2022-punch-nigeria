On-Air Personality, Ifedayo Olarinde, popularly known as Daddy Freeze, has called on Nigerian actor and Presidential aspirant, Yul Edochie, to unite his home before seeking support for his political ambitions. On Wednesday, the actor caused a stir after announcing that he had not only married his colleague, Judy Austin, as a second wife, but also welcomed a son with her. On Saturday, Edochie urged Nigerians, who trended his second marriage earlier in the week, to buy him the presidential form under the All Progressives Grand Alliance party. Responding to his plea, Daddy Freeze fired back at the actor, asking him to fix his home before seeking the help of Nigerians in his bid for the Presidency. “My dear brother, unite your polygamous home first before coming to ask for public groom price,” He wrote on his Instagram page on Saturday. He added, “Which one is ‘buy form for me’, seriously? After annoying a whole nation? After what you did to your wife of sixteen years we should now trust you?” “I have nothing against polygamy, its just the audacity for me, combined with what I believe to be betrayal.” Yul married his first wife, May Yul-Edochie back in 2004. The couple have four kids together. Reacting to Yul’s announcement of his new marriage, May called the judgement of God on the new couple. She afterward unfollowed her husband on Instagram.
