A former Minister of Power, Prof Barth Nnaji, has said Nigeria needed over 100,000 megawatts of power to address the persistent power problem in the country. Nnaji said this while addressing newsmen on Friday in Enugu on the state of the power sector in the country. He attributed the problem in the sector to the supply value chain, adding that the country had challenges in generation, transmission and distribution of power. He said all these had made it impossible to make adequate power supply available to the users. “Nigeria is a country of more than 200 million people and needs more than 100,000 megawatts of power and infrastructure,” he said. Nnaji said the power project of Geometric Power Ltd., his company in Aba, Abia State, had the capacity to provide power in Aba within six months. “We are installing meters to bridge the disagreement gap between customers and suppliers of electricity. “I support unbundling of power sector where states will be allowed to own and manage their own power supply,” he said. According to him, the company had invested heavily in power distribution in Aba to strengthen distribution. He added that distribution companies had to do the same thing to improve power supply. NAN
