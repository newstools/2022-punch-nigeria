Vice President Yemi Osinbajo will on Tuesday evening host Senators on the platform of the All Progressives Congress to Iftar (breaking of fast). This was contained in a letter of invitation read by Senate President Ahmad Lawan at plenary on Monday. The letter was signed by the Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi. Also, Osinbajo is to meet with members of the All Progressives Congress caucus in the House of Representatives at the Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa for the breaking of the Ramadan fast (Iftar) on Wednesday. The Deputy Speaker of the House, Ahmed Wase, read the Vice-President’s letter to the caucus at the opening of the plenary on Tuesday. The invitation from Osinbajo came less than 48 hours after he hosted APC governors to Iftar on Sunday night to seek their support for his presidential ambition. The Vice-President had in the early hours of Monday declared his interest to run for President in the 2023 general elections. This is as the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, Tuesday, resigned as Senator representing Nasarawa West Senatorial District. This was even as the newly elected Deputy National Chairman (North), Abubakar Kyari, also resigned as lawmaker representing Borno North District. The resignation letters of both lawmakers were also read by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, during plenary. Senator Abdullahi Adamu, until his election as National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, chaired the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Kyari, on the other hand, was the Chairman of the Committee on Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
