The youth of Akotogbo in the Irele Local Government Area of Ondo State on Thursday took to the streets to protest against the alleged neglect of the community by the state government. The protesters vowed to disrupt all political meetings, rallies and campaigns in the community if the government refused to resolve the deficit of social amenities in the town. The protesters stated that the 12-kilometre Akotogbo-Ajagba Road, which linked the area to other parts of Ondo State, had been cut off for a long time and the government did nothing about it. They also stated that the community lacked good roads, electricity and other infrastructure. According to them, Akotogbo is the only big town at the boundary of Edo and Ondo states that has no road and electricity supply. The community’s youth leader, Mr Nenuwa Ayodele, expressed disappointment in the past political leaders elected from the area. “Kidnappers have turned the only road linking the town to other parts of Ondo State to death traps as they strike daily,” he added. The Regent of Akotogbo, High Chief Iwalewa Emoruwa, appealed to the government to respond to the plights of the community. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
