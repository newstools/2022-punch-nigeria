Victor Ayeni THE campaign organisation of the Niger State All Progressives Congress governorship aspirant, Umar Bida, has dispelled a rumour that Bida has defected to the New Nigeria People’s Party. The head of the media team, Muhammad Sonmaji, disclosed this on Tuesday, in a statement made available to journalists. The statement read in part, “We would like to inform the good people of Niger State that Umar Bida has not decamped to the NNPP. We have discovered that the news of our principal’s defection is being spread by saboteurs to distract USB 2023, who is busy consulting with various interest groups in the state towards the realisation of his aspiration to become the governor of Niger State come 2023. “USB’23 remains a loyal member of the APC and has never belonged to any other party since he joined politics some years ago. We are aware of the activities of pretenders making serious efforts to cause disunity within the party before the primaries, and we believe that they will be put to shame. “USB’23 has been a dedicated and committed member of the APC in the state; he respects the sanctity and supremacy of the party and will never engage in any anti-party activity. He remains a loyal party member and aspirant for the governorship seat of the state.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
