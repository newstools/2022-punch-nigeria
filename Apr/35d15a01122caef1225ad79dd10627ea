A yet-to-be identified policeman and three others have been killed while many others were abducted in a banditry attack in Gwada community in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State. The attack was said to have occurred when Muslim faithful were breaking their Ramadan fast on Saturday evening. The spokesperson of the Coalition of Shiroro Association, Salisu Sabo, said the attack lasted over four hours. Sabo added that the attack led to the abduction of many people, one of them being a businesswoman whose shop was looted by the terrorists. He identified another victim of the abduction to be a son of one of the officials of the North-South Power Company. “With this attack, it means that only Kuta has not been attacked in Shiroro. Gwada is tensed and people are considering moving to Kuta as an alternative,” he said. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Wasiu Abiodun, confirmed the incident, adding that details were still sketchy. “On April 16, 2022, at about 7pm, information was received that bandits attacked Kadna village via Gwada, Shiroro Local Government Area. “Police tactical team and other security agencies with vigilante members were mobilised to the area and the hoodlums were repelled,” he said. Abiodun added that he was not aware of ransom of N2 million allegedly being demanded from the relatives of the abducted persons.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
