Two Abia businessmen are set to issue a N200 million cheque for the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and the Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, to purchase their presidential nomination and expression of interest forms at the All Progressives Congress. The Igbere, Bende Local Government Area of Abia State businessmen, Ukaegbu James and Nnanna Kalu, made the announcement in Abuja on Wednesday, stating that both Lawan and Kalu were competent leaders to succeed the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) in 2023. They noted that the APC needed a unifier, and a committed leader with a good knowledge of Nigeria, adding “If we must get it right in 2023, we need result-oriented leaders like Kalu and Lawan to succeed Buhari in 2023. “It is time to present our best hands because there won’t be any room for the writing of fake results and we are ready to make N200 million available by the weekend to purchase their nomination forms. “We are convinced by their track record, managerial skills, experience, and leadership acumen.” Copyright PUNCH.
