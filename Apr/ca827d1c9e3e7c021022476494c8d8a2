Former Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki, has said the time had come for members of the People’s Democratic Party in Kwara State to unite and secure victory in the 2023 general election. Saraki said it was paramount for the PDP to secure victory in 2023 for the good of its members and the entire people of Kwara State. The PDP Presidential hopeful spoke on Saturday while addressing all PDP aspirants in Kwara at a meeting in Ilorin, the state capital. Saraki, according to a statement by his Press Officer on Local Matters, Abdulganiyu Abdulqadir, commended stakeholders, aspirants and their supporters for their cooperation so far, but said a lot still needs to be done to ensure that their efforts do not end in vain. He said, “As aspirants, you made commitments, promises and now is the time to stand by your words.” Saraki added that not just the aspirants, but all members must ensure that all hands were on deck to guarantee the party’s victory in next year’s elections. “We need everyone to win this battle as prosperity and development abound when the PDP forms the government in Kwara and Nigeria,” he said. The presidential hopeful who on Friday, emerged as the controversial PDP consensus candidate from the northern axis, also appealed to stakeholders to be just, fair and unbiased in the emergence of candidates of the party. All aspirants who spoke at the meeting assured the leadership of the party of their readiness to work together and deliver victory for the PDP in the coming elections, the statement said.
