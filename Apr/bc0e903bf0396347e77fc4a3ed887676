.Eagles forward scores fourth career goal against Red Devils Super Eagles forward, Kelechi Iheanacho, ended his three months Premier League goal drought on Saturday after he scored in Leicester City’s 1-1 draw away to Manchester United at Old Trafford, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The Nigerian last scored a league goal for the Foxes in their 6-3 loss to Manchester City on Boxing Day last year. Iheanacho broke the deadlock with a superb 63rd-minute opener when he met a left-wing cross from James Maddison with a fine diving header. The Foxes’ advantage lasted just three minutes, as Fred was on hand to convert the rebound after Bruno Fernandes’ shot had been pushed into his path by Kasper Schmeichel. The goal against Manchester United was his third in the EPL this season in what was his 20th appearance. The strike also took his tally to four in 10 games against Manchester United across all competitions. His first goal was in a Manchester derby game back in September 2016 in the colours of Manchester City. He also bagged a brace against the Red Devils in an Emirates FA Cup clash at the King Power Stadium in March 2021. The Nigeria international was replaced in the 90th minute for Patson Daka. He has now scored seven goals and made nine assists in 33 appearances for the Foxes this season. Iheanacho is expected to keep his place when Leicester City face PSV in Thursday’s quarter-final first leg Europa Conference League clash at the King Power stadium.
