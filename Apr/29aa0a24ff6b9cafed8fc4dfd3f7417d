The Imo State House of Assembly Speaker, Kennedy Ibe, has lifted the suspension he slammed on his predecessor, Paul Emeziem. Also recalled was Ngozi Obiefule, who represents the Isu state constituency. The Assembly had, on November 8, sacked Emeziem as the Speaker, and suspended him and three others immediately. Immediately Emeziem was sacked and suspended, Ibe was announced the new Speaker. Those suspended alongside Emeziem were a former Deputy Speaker, Okey Onyekanma, and a former minority leader, Ekene Nnodimele. The speaker, who had since suspended more lawmakers and declared seats of two lawmakers vacant, announced on Tuesday that Emeziem had been recalled after he apologized. Obiefule was suspended alongside other lawmakers on December 23, the same day Ibe declared the seat of Tochi Okere ( Ngor Okpala) vacant. An activist and associate of the Speaker, Samuel Iwuoha, confirmed it to journalists in Owerri on Tuesday. Iwuoha said, “Suspension of Former Speaker of Imo state House of Assembly, Rt Hon Paul Emeziem, Lifted after Apologising for His Unparliamentary Conducts.” The Chief Press Secretary to the Speaker, Ifeanyi Onyekachi, confirmed the development when contacted by our correspondent. The speaker’s aide said, “A former speaker, Rt Hon Paul Emeziem and Rt Hon Ngozi Obiefule have been recalled. “ Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
