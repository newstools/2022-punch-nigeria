A member of the Advisory Board of the school, Mr Akin Fadeyi, said journalists would be invited to share their experiences with the students as critical stakeholders in the development of education. He noted that it was not enough for students to have only classroom learning saying, education should be holistic in approach in such a way that it would shape their ability to be innovative. Fadeyi said,  “We need to build well-disciplined youths with character and identity; and capacity to resist immorality. Education is a tool to enshrine peace and stability. It is about connecting the students to agents of a sustainable world. Education should be able to shape the right narrative and value orientation so that we can have a better society.” The Chairman, Education Writers Association of Nigeria, Mr Mojeed Alabi, expressed the association’s readiness to maximise the opportunity towards making society a better place. “As a body of education journalists, EWAN is committed to any effort targeted at promoting quality education delivery and securing the future for the younger generation of Nigerians and Africans, by extension,” he said.
