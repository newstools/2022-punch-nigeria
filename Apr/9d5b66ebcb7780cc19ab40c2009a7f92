The Commissioner for Education and Human Capital Development in Kwara State, Hajiya Sa’adatu Modibbo-Kawu, has resigned her appointment with the state government with effect from Thursday. Modibbo-Kawu said that she tendered her letter of resignation in line with the state government circular, passed on Tuesday by the Secretary to the government, that political appointees seeking to contest for elective offices should resign, adding that she resigned to contest for an elective office in the 2023 general election. She told journalists at a media parley organised by the Correspondents Chapel of the State Council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists in Ilorin on Thursday, that she was seeking the All Progressives Congress nomination as its candidate for the Ilorin East/ Ilorin South Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives. She told newsmen that she took the bold decision in furtherance of her determination to serve her people at the National Assembly. She said that she understood the challenges facing the people of her constituency and that if elected, she will do everything humanly possible to address the challenges. The former commissioner expressed satisfaction about the turnaround that the education sector witnessed during her tenure as commissioner. She expressed appreciation to Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq for the opportunity given her to serve in what she described as his purposeful administration. Modibbo-Kawu was the first political appointee to resign from the Kwara State cabinet seeking to contest for the 2023 elections. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
