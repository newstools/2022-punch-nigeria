Italian defender of Nigerian descent, Destiny Udogie, is relishing his partnership with Isaac Success and revealed he enjoyed playing with the Nigerian forward. Both players were on target as Udinese played out a thrilling 2-2 draw with Bologna at the Stadio Renato Dell’Ara on Sunday. Success did well to combine with Gerard Deulofeu, before setting up Udogie for Udinese’s equaliser in the 25th minute, after Aaron Hickey had put the hosts ahead in the sixth minute. The 26-year-old got on the score sheet himself a few seconds after the start of the second half to put Udinese ahead, before Nicola Sansone’s 59th-minute strike denied the Little Zebras all three points. Having initially struggled in Serie A after completing a move from Watford to the Italian outfit last summer, Success has been outstanding in recent weeks and has contributed a goal and four assists in his last five games. His revival has, however, not gone unnoticed, with Udogie singing his praises. “Playing with Isaac (Success) is very interesting,” Udogie told Mundo Udinese. “He is outstanding and knows how to play very intelligently. Mainly from the wings, and he facilitates a lot of situations with his plays.” Udogie, who is on loan from Hellas Verona, has scored three goals already this season and the young defender credited the goal to Success and Deulofeu for their contributions. “Surely, the coach asks us and in fact, we want to be present as much as possible in the area,” Udogie added. “The coach said to recognise the spaces. The hardest thing was done by Isaac and Gerry (Deulofeu), who put me in front of the goal, and then I just had to score.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
