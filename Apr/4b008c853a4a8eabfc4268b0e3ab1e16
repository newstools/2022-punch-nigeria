Leicester City forward, Kelechi Iheanacho, will be aiming to end his three-game goals drought in the UEFA Europa Conference League when the Foxes host Roma in the first leg of their semi-final clash at the King Power Stadium on Thursday (today), Sports Extra reports. The Nigeria international has appeared in all of the Foxes’ Conference League games since dropping from the Europa League. The 25-year-old has made six appearances in the competition, with one goal and an assist to his name. Iheanacho’s only goal of the competition was scored in the first leg of the round of 16 against Stade Rennais on March 10, when Leicester defeated the French club 2-0. The Nigerian however failed to score in the second leg in France and could not also get on the score sheet in the two-legged affair against PSV Eindhoven. Leicester face a tough task against Jose Mourinho’s side in the semi-final and Brendan Rogers, who is already without Wilfred Ndidi, will hope his men can be at their best, including the misfiring Iheanacho. “He’ll be in the squad. It’s the emotion of everyone,” Rogers said when asked about Jamie Vardy’s availability for the clash. “It’s important the aggression is there from the top of the field, if it’s Jamie or anyone else. It’s about the emotion in the crowd.” It is a season to forget for Iheanacho who has only managed to score seven goals in 38 games across all competitions.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
