The Maritime Organisation of West and Central Africa has solicited technical collaboration with the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency to recommend Nigeria’s anti-piracy law to other member countries. The Secretary-General of MOWCA, Dr. Paul Adalikwu, said this in Lagos when he visited the Director-General of NIMASA, Dr Bashir Jamoh. He also lauded the gains recorded by Nigeria in suppressing maritime crimes, leading to the country’s removal from the list of high-risk maritime countries. Adalikwu described the country’s Suppression of Piracy and Other Maritime Offences Act as effective legislation that had redefined the fight against maritime crimes in the country. “MOWCA will showcase the Act for other member countries to remodel their anti piracy laws to achieve harmonisation and cohesion in the drive for a safer and secure maritime domain in the sub-regions.” Adalikwu added that countries like Gambia, Cameroon, and others in MOWCA had requested, through his office, for technical collaboration to further develop their respective maritime administrations. In his speech, Jamoh described MOWCA as one keeping to the promises Nigeria made during the campaigns in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo and Accra, Ghana, in the run-up to the election. The NIMASA DG also urged Adalikwu to synchronise his economic plan with the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement, particularly in the area of maritime, trade and provision of reliable statistical shipping data.
