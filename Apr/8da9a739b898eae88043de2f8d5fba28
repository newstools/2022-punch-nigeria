The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Muhammad Bello, has said his administration has been under intense pressure from residents following the increasing rate of kidnapping and banditry in the neighbouring towns. Bello said criminals perfected their plans outside before striking their targets in the territory. The minister stated this when he received the Assistant Inspector-General of Police (Zone 7), Muhammad Aliyu, and his team in his office. In a statement on Wednesday by his Chief Press Secretary, Anthony Ogunleye, Bello, however, urged the Nigeria Police to tighten security in the nation’s capital, especially in the suburbs of the FCT. He expressed confidence in the capacity of the AIG, given his wealth of experience and successes in similar postings across the country. The statement read in part, “We have been under a lot of pressure from citizens, especially those in the surrounding towns in the Area Councils, especially with regards to the spate of kidnapping and some issues of banditry which I’m sure you are very much aware of. “As the AIG for the zone, I’m sure you will leverage on your vast network to be able to really coordinate the states within your zone because what we have realized in the FCT is that criminal activities are usually hatched outside the territory and then people come into the FCT, perform these acts and move across the borders to the surrounding states.” He assured that the FCT would work toward providing the zone with all the necessary support it required to function effectively.
