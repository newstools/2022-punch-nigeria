The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Friday, presented the All Progressives Congress party’s flag to the APC candidate, Abiodun Oyebanji, in the Ekiti State governorship election, scheduled for June 18, 2022. The candidate was led to the President by the National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, the National Secretary, Senator Iyiola Omisore, and Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State. This was contained in a statement by Buhari’s spokesman, Femi Adesina, on Friday, titled, ‘You have my best wishes, says President Buhari to Ekiti APC gubernatorial candidate, Abiodun Oyebanji’. Presenting the flag to Oyebanji, Buhari said, “You have served Ekiti State in many capacities, including as Chief of Staff, Commissioner, and Secretary to the State Government. Being Governor will just be continuity of service. I honestly wish you the best of luck.” On his part, the National Chairman said APC was planning to win the contest, “by the grace of God,” adding that it was the reason the candidate was being presented for presidential blessings. Fayemi said Oyebanji had been involved in governance in Ekiti in the past 20 years and has acquitted himself creditably. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
