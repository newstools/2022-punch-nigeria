The United States has announced the commencement of the construction of its Consulate General in Lagos as part of the US bilateral relationship with Nigeria. The US Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Leonard, announced this according to a statement on Thursday during the event attended by the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and the US Consul General, Claire Pierangelo, in Lagos. She said, “The $537 million new Consulate construction project will directly benefit the Nigerian people. Throughout the project, an estimated $95 million will be invested in the local economy, and the project will employ approximately 2,500 Nigerian citizens, including engineers, architects, artisans, construction workers, and administrative staff. “Our vision for this remarkable Consulate campus is to create a facility that both honours the vibrant relationship between the United States and Nigeria and communicates the spirit of American democracy, transparency and openness.” Pierangelo said that the project when completed would be the largest US Consulate in the world. “The new Consulate will provide a modern space for the largest consular operation in Africa, including improved public-facing interview and waiting areas. When completed, it will be the largest US Consulate in the world, demonstrating the importance of the relationship between the United States and Nigeria. “Nigeria and the United States have a long-standing history of people-to-people engagement fostering bridges between our two nations. We look forward to the many accomplishments we will continue to achieve together in the future,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
