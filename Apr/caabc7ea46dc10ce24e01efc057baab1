The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, has reportedly distributed medical equipment to police health facilities across the country. He also admonished the force personnel to take full advantage of the health facilities in their respective commands and formations, especially in the light of the recent distribution of the equipment to police hospitals, clinics, and cottage health centres. A statement on Sunday by the Force spokesman, Muyiwa Adejobi said, “As part of events to mark this year’s World Malaria Day, the IGP has ensured the distribution of the acquired medical facilities which include among others, 50 oxygen cylinders, 50 Oxygen Regulators, 52 Chemical Sprayers, four Electrocardiogram machines, Automated External Defibrillators, Anesthetic Machines and accessories, operating tables, hospital beds/mattresses, incubators and Autoclaves, Suction Machines. “The IGP notes that the services of police hospitals and health care facilities are not restricted to police personnel alone as well-meaning members of the public can equally access and benefit from the top-notch services rendered at the police medical facilities across the country.” Baba equally urged his men to take advantage of the health facilities and engage in physical exercises, medical checks and good diet to improve their living conditions and reduce avoidable deaths while on duty, and subsequently advance their service delivery. Similarly, the IGP, in the spirit of the 2022 World Health Day, charged the public to regularly imbibe good health conditions, environmental sanitation, reduction of activities responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer and all sorts of pollutions damaging the ecosystem “which in turn kills us silently on a regular basis.” Copyright PUNCH.
