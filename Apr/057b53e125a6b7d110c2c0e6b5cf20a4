The Shepherd Superintendent of the Household of God church, Rev Chris Okotie, has extolled the virtues and talents of Chief Commander Ebenezer Obey, who turned 80 on Sunday, April 3, 2022. Okotie in his tribute described Obey as a music legend. The cleric said this in a statement by his media adviser, Ladi Ayodeji, on Sunday. The statement read, “The splendiferous tonality of Obey’s voice, his philosophical articulation of life’s realities and the soul-searching melodies of his music, have elevated him to the deserving status of a living legend. “Decades of creative artistry corroborate this position: A uniquely gifted music maestro, Obey towers above all the other great artistes who occupy the chambers of his popular music genre. “His voice carries a compelling vocal afflatus, an impartation from heaven, which distinguishes him from other minstrels in his generation. “His music may galvanize you to the dance floor, draw you into the quietude of meditation or engage your heart in the plenitude of God’s grace. These facets of his creative acumen are attestation to his prolific versatility. “I am proud to be associated with such musical royalty as Evangelist Ebenezer Obey-Fabiyi. I salute and hail a great icon and musical colossus at 80.”
