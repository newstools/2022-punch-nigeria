Organiser of the Okpekpe International 10km Road Race, Mike Itemuagbor, has hailed the appointment of retired long jumper Yusuf Alli as Team Nigeria’s coordinator for the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, United Kingdom. Alli, a former Africa, Commonwealth and World University Games champion, and two-time World Athletics Championship and one-time Olympic Games long jump finalist, was named as Team Nigeria coordinator by the sports ministry this week. “This is a classic case of a square peg in a square hole,” Itemuagbor said. “Yusuf has proven his mettle as an athlete, winning continental, Commonwealth and global medals for Nigeria. He has also proved to be an astute sports administrator and this he has proven by helping to make the Okpekpe 10km race the first to be granted a World Athletics label,” Itemuagbor added. Alli, the current Chairman, Edo State Sports Commission, has been the technical director and consultant for the Okpekpe 10km race since inception in 2013. The 61-year-old holds a personal best of 8.27m in the long jump set on his way to winning the African Athletics Championship gold medal at the National Stadium, Lagos in August 1989. That mark is the farthest any Nigerian man has jumped. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
