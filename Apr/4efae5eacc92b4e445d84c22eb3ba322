A former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has said that he will proceed to the Court of Appeal on Monday to appeal his sacking. A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja had on Friday declared Dogara’s seat vacant for defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress. Dogara represents the Dass/Bogoro/Tafawa Balewa Constituency of Bauchi State in the National Assembly and will be ending his fourth term in June 2023. The former Speaker’s media aide, Turaki Hassan, said in a statement that Dogara had asked his counsel to immediately appeal the judgment. The statement is titled, ‘PDP Vs Dogara: We are appealing against the judgment – J. J. Usman, SAN’. Hassan quoted Usman as saying he had been instructed by the ex-Speaker to appeal the judgment with immediate effect. He quoted the counsel to have said, “The judgment has just been delivered and we have briefed our client right from the court and he has expressed dissatisfaction with the judgment and has instructed that we file an appeal immediately, which we shall do on Monday. “The decision of the court that there is evidence of defection to the APC is not substantiated by any shred of evidence in the court’s record. We are proceeding to the Court of Appeal immediately.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
