A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in Ogun State, Adekunle Ayoola, has urged the people of Benue State to support a member of the House of Representatives from the state, Herman Hembe, as the next governor of the state. Ayoola disclosed this in a statement made available to journalists on Saturday in which he described the third term federal lawmaker as a patriotic Nigerian whose passion for service was worthy of emulation. He said, “The resources these governors command are so much that any of our states that is fortunate to have someone who is truly ready to serve the people will witness so much development and economic prosperity, because the resources of the state would purely be deployed to making lives more comfortable for the people. “It is against this background that I am calling on the people of Benue State to throw their weight behind the governorship aspiration of Hon Herman Hembe, currently representing Konshisha/Vandeikya Federal Constituency at the House of Representatives.” Copyright PUNCH.
