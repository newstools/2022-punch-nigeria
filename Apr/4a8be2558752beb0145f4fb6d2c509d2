The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) is currently at the meeting of the National Executive Committee of the All Progressives Congress, at Transcorp Hilton, Abuja. The President is joined by his Vice, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, other members of the National Working Committee, Board of Trustee and state governors. The NEC meeting is the first the APC is holding after its much-anticipated National Convention held last month where the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee was dissolved and new leadership was sworn in by the President. Although the top agenda for Wednesday’s NEC meeting remains under wraps, the Party’s timetable of activities ahead of next year’s elections is believed to be top of the agenda. This includes dates and prices for the sale of nomination and expression of interest forms for all electoral offices including the Presidency, Governorship, Senate, House of Representatives and State House of Representatives. Also to be discussed is the mode of primaries the party would adopt in its primary elections holding next month, in accordance with the INEC timetable. Details later… Copyright PUNCH.
