Rivers United head coach Stanley Eguma believes the title race is still open despite seeing his side extend their lead at the top of the table to four points after a 2-0 win over Enyimba on Monday. Enyimba, 2019 champions, were guests of the champions-in-waiting at their fortress, the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium, Port Harcourt in a match-day 23 game moved by 24 hours after their lengthy trip back from Katsina. Rivers were aiming for a rare league double over the People’s Elephant and they got their noses in front in the 21st minute when league’s leading scorer Ishaq Rafiu converted from the penalty spot after he had been upended by Enyimba captain Austin Oladapo for his 12th goal of the campaign. The Pride of Rivers doubled their advantage in the 34th minute through Chiamaka Madu, who bundled home from close range after a moment of defensive uncertainty for the visitors. Enyimba tried to claw their way back into the game but were prevented by a resolute Rivers side, who had an answer for every question asked by the former champions. Monday’s win takes Rivers’ points tally for the season to a staggering 52 from 23 matches, four clear of second-place Plateau United, who have 48 points from the same number of games. But Eguma, a league winner in 2011, insists nothing is guaranteed yet. “Like I will always say, it is not yet over,” he told www.npfl.ng. “The league is a marathon; you cannot say it is over when we have more than 15 games to play. “So, one cannot just begin to celebrate. We still have other tough opponents to play, so, for now I think we’re still on course and there’s a very big hope in the team that we can achieve.”
