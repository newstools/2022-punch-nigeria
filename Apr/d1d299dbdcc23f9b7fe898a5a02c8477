The Lagos Food Bank Initiative has partnered Ajrena Foods Limited, producers of Nutzy Peanut Butter, to feed about 250,000 malnourished and indigent children in every low-cost private nursery and primary school in Lagos. A statement said this aimed to address hunger, promote good health and well-being, which would enhance quality learning. Speaking at the launch of the partnership with the theme, ‘Buy a jar, feed a child campaign’ by Food Bank Initiative and Nutzy Peanut CSR Initiative, in Lagos, Chief Executive Officer/Founder of Lagos Food Bank Initiative, Mr Michael Sunbola, said the 250,000 target was the initiative’s short term goal. He also said its long term goal was to feed at least 250m pupils in Lagos. Sunbola said, “We understand that most children go to school on empty stomachs. So we took it upon ourselves to feed them three times every week; that is Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays as part of our school’s feeding programme. “We buy Nutzy Peanut Butter from our partner- Ajrena Foods Ltd, at a reduced cost, which helps to ensure every child in Lagos gets a pack of Nutzy Peanut Butter which aids in the treatment of malnutrition in children.” Also speaking, the Head, Corporate Social Responsibility, Ajrena Foods Ltd, Serena Ramnani, said the essence of the collaboration was to ensure every child in Lagos gets a pack of Nutzy Peanut Butter, manufactured. Ramnani added that this was to ensure every child in Lagos gets a pack of Nutzy Peanut Butter which aids in the treatment of malnutrition in children. She said, ‘The whole idea is when adult consumers buy a jar of Nutzy Creamy, it automatically means a free sachet of peanut butter for a child in Lagos. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
