Glasgow Rangers midfielder Joe Aribo says he is confident the Scottish Champions can win against any opponent as they continue their quest of winning the Europa League for the first time. Rangers face Leipzig in the first leg of the semi-final of the Europa League at the Red Bull Arena on Thursday, with the return leg at Ibrox on May 5. The Gers, against all odds, knocked out Borussia Dortmund to reach the Round of 16 of the European competitions where they got the better of Red Star Belgrade before defeating Braga to book a place in the semi-final of the competition. After knocking out one of the tournament’s favourites, Aribo, who has featured in every single game for Rangers in the Europa League this season, boasted that the Scottish giants could beat any opponent. “The boys were buzzing when we played Dortmund because it’s such a big club,” Aribo said to UEFA’s official website. “When we won that, it was like: ‘OK, we can keep going here; the favourites have been knocked out, so we can keep pushing.’ And that’s what we’ve done. We can win playing against anyone. If we stick to our task then we can get the win. “Dortmund and Leipzig being in the same league, it shows that we can do this.” Should they fend off competition from Leipzig; Rangers will face the winners between West Ham United and Eintracht Frankfurt in the final of the Europa League.
