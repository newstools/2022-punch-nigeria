Former Napoli midfielder Salvatore Bagni has jumped to the defence of Nigerian Victor Osimhen, following his below par performance in Napoli’s 1-1 draw against Roma on Monday, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Osimhen has often been criticised for his inability to shine against some of the big teams in Italy, with Atalanta and Lazio the only two teams among the elite clubs in Italy he had scored against. Against Roma, Osimhen did not play his best match and appeared too isolated forward and often cut off from the game. The former Lille forward only touched the ball 20 times before he was substituted late on. So far this season, the Super Eagles striker has scored 12 Serie A goals, with none of them against Napoli’s direct rivals, much to the disappointment of the club’s faithful. However, Bagni, in a quote published by napolipiu.com, said the quality of the Nigerian striker was unquestionable. “The problem is that there are no playable balls in front of him: they are serving him less than in the past and also badly. “There is no suggestion from the attacking midfielder, but these balls are often thrown from the defence. And it is clear that in certain situations the opposing defences have an easy game on Osimhen. “But we cannot question the value of the player. I have received important news about the center forward. “They told me that all the most important teams in Europe, those aiming to win, are interested in the Nigerian. Is there a reason or not?”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
