The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, on Friday, shared how he got over his “deep sorrow” caused by the death of his son, Dare, last May. According to the octogenarian preacher, a text message from one of his spiritual daughters turned the tide following the death of his 42-year-old son in 2021. Adeboye spoke at the international headquarters of the church along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway during the April 2022 Holy Ghost Service of the church. Dare had passed on on May 4, 2021 during his sleep in Eket, Akwa Ibom State, where he pastored a church and was based with his family. Speaking on the theme, ‘Signs and Wonders’, on Friday night, the elder Adeboye said children are proofs that God is a Miracle Worker, a Covenant-Keeper, a Burden-Bearer and the Defence of the Defenceless. According to him, God is a Carrier, who carries burden, sorrow and problems provided one has the disposition of a child. He said, “When I lost my son last year (2021), then I was deeply in sorrow, I got a text (message) from one of my (spiritual) daughters that suddenly turned the tide. What she wrote was simply this: Daddy, let God carry you.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
