Ogun State Police Command on Thursday paraded 69 suspects for alleged murder, kidnapping and cultism. Parading the suspects at the command headquarters in Eleweran Abeokuta, the state Police Public Relations Officer Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the command arrested 52 suspects in connection with cult-related activities. He said cult clashes had claimed more than 20 lives in the last one month across the state. Oyeyemi also paraded 12 suspected kidnappers, two armed robbery suspects and ritualists as well as a self-acclaimed Islamic cleric who allegedly specialises in defrauding unsuspecting members of the public. He said the arrests of the suspects were part of the command’s efforts at suppressing the menace of cultism and other vices across the state, particularly cult clashes in some parts of the state. Oyeyemi attributed the clashes witnessed in the state to supremacy battle among four rival cult groups of Eiye, Aiye, Alora, and Viking Confraternity. He explained that the development compelled the state Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, to set up a special squad with the mandate of fishing out members of the cult groups wherever they could be hibernating across the state. On the self-acclaimed cleric, Oyeyemi said the suspected fraudster, identified as Abdul Salami Yakub, was arrested following a petition forwarded to the Commissioner of Police by one Rukayat Ibrahim that the suspect defrauded her and her younger sister, Oluwaseun Ibrahim, to the tune of N5.475million.
