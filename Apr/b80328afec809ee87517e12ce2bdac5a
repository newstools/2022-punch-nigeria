The IMAX cinema in Lekki, Lagos, recently played host to a galaxy of stars in the movie industry for the premiere of the movie, ‘The Blood Covenant’. The event, which held on April 10, 2022, saw many of the attendees dressed in colourful attire. The director of the movie, Fiyin Gambo, noted that the movie advises parents, religious leaders and others to only celebrate people with legitimate means of income, and condemn those involved in money rituals and other vices. One of the actors in the movie, Uzor Arukwe, also said, “I think it is a fantastic movie, especially with what the government has said about the movie industry being part of the cause, or problem of influencing money ritual.” Meanwhile, one of the highlights of the event was the arrival of a disqualified Big Brother Naija housemate, Erica Nlewedim, who also acted in the movie. She was immediately swarmed by journalists and fans who took turns in taking her pictures. Actors in the movie include Tobi Bakre, Shawn Faqua, Omowunmi Dada, Uzor Arukwe, Erica Nlewedim, Ufuoma McDermott, Alex Ekubo, Shalewa Ashafa, and Chimezie Imo. The movie was directed by Gambo from a script written by Chiemaka Osagwu, and produced Inkblot Productions’ co-founder Chinaza Onuzo, and Zulumoke Oyibo, with Maryann Eziekwe serving as a co-producer.
