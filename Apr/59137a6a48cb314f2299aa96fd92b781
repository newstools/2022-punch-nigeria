Two gunmen were arrested by the police after shooting sporadically and invading the Rumuagholu community in Obio/Akpor local government area of Rivers State and robbing six Point of Sale shops. The attack caused panic in the community following the ear-splitting sound buzzing from the assailants’ guns. It was gathered that the gunmen numbering up to four had, about 11:00 am on Thursday, invaded the area under heavy gunfire and also robbed residents of their belongings. The robbers moved from a T-junction and carried on through to road-2 area in the community while shooting into the air to scare residents. They proceeded to rob the POS shops along the Rumuagholu road. Sources said that the shootings attracted the police from a nearby station who moved into action and chased the criminals to the Obiri-Ikwerre/Airport road. One of the sources, who did not want his name in print for fear of his life, said that the criminals had abandoned their vehicle, jumped into a tricycle, and fled into Rumuosi road before two of them were apprehended. “Four boys came and attacked some POS office in Rumuagholu. They started operating from T-Junction to road-2. “They attacked and robbed six POS offices. They took cash and phones. They were shooting in the air. The shootings caused fear and people ran for safety. “I don’t know how the police got the information. Although, before the police came, the boys had driven off. But police chased them and caught two of them while two escaped,” he stated. When contacted, the acting spokesperson of the state police command, Grace Iringe-Koko, confirmed the incident, saying, “We apprehended two of the suspects, and investigations are ongoing.” Copyright PUNCH.
