The Catholic Bishop of Ekiti Diocese, Felix Ajakaye, has appealed to both the Academic Staff Union of Universities and the Federal Government to resolve the lingering crisis that led to the closure of all public universities in the country. The bishop said there was the need to end the crisis for the sake of the students, whose future was at stake. Ajakaye, who spoke at the funeral mass held in honour of the immediate past Vice-Chancellor of the Federal University of Technology, Akure, Professor Adebiyi Daramola, stated, “Students, parents, and the country are being adversely affected because of the fight between ASUU and FG. Both sides should devise a new way to resolve the crisis and save the country’s university system. “The time has come for the managers of the country and Nigerians in general, to have the right attitude and get our priorities right.” Speaking of late Daramola, who served as the VC of FUTA between May 2012 and May 2017, the cleric described him as a God-fearing person who made his mark in the academic world and contributed immensely to the development of his country. “Let’s do good and leave good legacies. Daramola was a courteous and courageous person. He was humble; he reflected his good up-bringing in his relationships with people.” He left worthy legacies of excellent services in all his stations in life and particularly at FUTA where his legacies live on,” the bishop added. The former FUTA VC died on Friday March 25, 2022, during a brief illness, at the age of 64. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
