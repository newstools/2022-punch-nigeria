A coalition of groups in Borno State has purchased the expression of interest and nomination forms for the 2023 gubernatorial elections for Prof Babagana Zulum to re-contest as a governor of Borno State. The coalition which comprises registered clubs, associations, and professional bodies in the academia and health-care, marketers, transporters, and women groups, stated in a press briefing on Friday, in Maiduguri, that the performance of the governor in the past three years spurred them into purchasing the forms for his second term governorship bid. “We are registering our unflinching support for the continuity of his Excellency Prof. Babagana Zulum, the executive Governor of Borno State for another four years, having witnessed the unprecedented and enormous achievements by his administration across all spheres of human endeavors in the state for the past three years. “We also appeal to the general public and concerned citizens of the state to come en masse to support the cause. A dedicated account has been opened for them to make voluntary contributions to support this cause,” the coalition said.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
