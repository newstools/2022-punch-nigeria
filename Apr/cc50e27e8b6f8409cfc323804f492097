The governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party in Ekiti State, Chief Segun Oni, has berated the state police command over its alleged poor handling of the orgy of violence and mass shooting at the inauguration of the All Progressives Congress on Tuesday in Ado-Ekiti, saying “if the police are helpless, they should say it.” In a statement made available to journalists on Wednesday, Oni expressed shock that more than 24 hours after, no statement of the arrest of the perpetrators has yet been made. The statement quoted the spokesman and chairman of the campaign’s media team, Moses Jolayemi, as saying, “We have been waiting to hear a statement of arrest from the police in the last 24 hours but none has been issued. “We are afraid that this barbaric show of violence will be swept under the carpet.”
The former governor warned against giving citizens the latitude to resort to self-help in the event that the police fail to defend them.
