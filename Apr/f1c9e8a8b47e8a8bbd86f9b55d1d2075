The Ondo State Police Command said it has begun investigation into a bloody attack on a lady identified as Funmilola Ogundare in Akure, the state capital. Ogundare was found in a pool of blood inside her apartment located in Ijapo Estate. The victim was said to have been attacked by her boyfriend with a machete. He was said to have fled after the incident. The Public Relations Officer, Mrs Funmilayo Odunlami, explained that the suspect took the victim to his friend’s house where he allegedly committed the dastardly act. Odunlami said, “It was the owner of the apartment that reported the matter to the police. The suspect took the woman to the apartment to spend the night with her. We are on the lookout for him and an investigation has commenced.” A source said after the boyfriend allegedly fled and left the scene, some neighbours who heard her groaning in pain invited the police to the scene. The source added that the security agents forced the door of the apartment open and found the victim in a pool of blood with a deep cut in her head. The Executive Secretary of the Ondo State Agency against Sexual and Gender-Based Violence, Mrs Bola Joel-Ogundadegbe, who also confirmed the incident, said, “The victim was on oxygen between Wednesday and Thursday at the trauma centre in Ondo but has yet to regain consciousness and strength to talk.”  Copyright PUNCH.
