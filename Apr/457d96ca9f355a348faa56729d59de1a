A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress Bola Tinubu’s media aide, Tunde Rahman, has given a reason why the presidential aspirant was absent at the National Executive Council on Wednesday. He gave the reason in a chat with our correspondent on Wednesday. The PUNCH had reported that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) attended the meeting. The President was joined by his Vice, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, other members of the National Working Committee, Board of Trustees and state governors. Rahman said the APC constitution does not grant Tinubu permission to attend the meeting. “Asíwájú is not a member of NEC. He is a member of the National Caucus. Members of NEC are the President, VP, Senate President, Speaker, State chairmen of the party and members of the national executives of the party,” he said. The NEC meeting was attended by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmad Lawan, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, and other principal officers of the National Assembly, APC governors and state party chairmen.
