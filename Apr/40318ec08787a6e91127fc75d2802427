THE Special Adviser to Ondo State Governor on Environment, Oyeniyi Oseni, has commended the Lagos State Government for the establishment of Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency to protect the environment and quality of life of residents of the state. Oseni disclosed this, according to a statement on Sunday, during a tour to LASEPA headquarters at Alausa, Ikeja. He said, “The visit to LASEPA becomes necessary, following the resuscitation of the Ondo State Environmental Protection Agency earlier in the year by the State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), and the urgent need to protect the environment from all forms of pollution and further improve the standard of living of Ondo people through effective service delivery. “The Ondo State Government, under its current leadership, is keen about environmental protection, hence the need for the revamped environmental watch dog to keep up with developments in the sector and restore sanity to the state’s environment, particularly at this crucial time, when all hands must be on deck to collectively mitigate the effect of climate change on human health and the environment.” The General Manager, LASEPA, Dr Dolapo Fasawe, who received the delegate at the agency’s headquarters, said, “The under-study method of training was to develop an in-depth knowledge of how an organisation can be effectively managed to achieve its goals, navigating the challenges on the job and proffering solutions in tandem with global best practices.”  Copyright PUNCH.
