For the July 16 Osun governorship poll, a group of election monitors, Yiaga Africa, has said it would deploy up to 562 observers across the state. The group disclosed this in Osogbo on Thursday during ‘Watch The Vote Media Dialogue Roundtable Discussion,’ organised for print and broadcast journalists in Osun state. Addressing participants, a member of the Yiaga Board, Mr. Ezenwa Nwagwu, said the monitors that would be deployed through its Watch The Vote platform, would give reports from about 250 polling units that would be randomly selected and spread across the 30 local government areas of the state. He said, “YIAGA Africa will also be using Parallel Vote Tabulation (PVT), an advanced technology that leverages statistics and technology for the observation of the process of voting, counting, and tallying of election results. “About 500 WTV polling unit observers will be deployed to observe the accreditation, voting, and counting processes on Election Day. “Another 32 mobile observers will be deployed in all the 30 local government areas and they will be using their mobile phones to send observation reports to the YIAGA data centre.” Explaining the merits of the Parallel Vote Tabulation initiative, Yiaga Programme Manager, Paul James, said it would detect and prevent manipulation during the poll.
