Gunmen who abducted the founder and President of the Solid Rock Church, Apostle John Okoriko, in the Mkpat Enin Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, have reduced the ransom from N100m to N30m. The cleric was abducted on the church’s premises on Tuesday around 5pm by the hoodlums, who scaled the fence and dragged their victim to the gate before whisking him away. A family source on Thursday disclosed that the abductors later used the victim’s phone to communicate with his family. The source said the kidnappers first demanded N100m, but when the family could not raise the money, they reduced it to N30m. “This morning again, the man of God called us and said his abductors were still demanding N30m. We don’t have such money. We are still begging them,” he added. PUNCH Metro learnt that some stakeholders in the church warned members of the church to stop all social media posts on the matter in order to help security agencies in intelligence gathering. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Odiko Macdon, said the police would not spare any effort to ensure that the kidnapped pastor regained his freedom. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
