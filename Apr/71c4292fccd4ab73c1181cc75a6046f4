Former Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki, Tuesday advised the Peoples Democratic Party to adopt a consensus presidential candidate for the 2023 presidential election Speaking with journalists after a closed-door meeting with Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, at his country home in Umuobiakwa, Obingwa, Saraki said that arrangement would be in the best interest of Nigeria in the present circumstance. PDP, he said, needs to get things right before the presidential primary, adding “If PDP wins we all win because we all are one”. According to him, any process that would lead to salvaging the nation from bad leadership should be activated. He also lamented the deluge of blood across the nation due to the activities of terrorists like the massacre of 135 persons in Plateau State a few days ago. He stated the urgent need to join hands to retrieve Nigeria from the hands of the ruling APC that has failed in all ramifications, stating “it is a tough challenge” to agree on a consensus presidential candidate. Saraki emphasised that picking a consensus candidate for the 2023 presidential poll would put PDP in a vantage position to win the election. He said that the four of them going round to canvass for consensus candidates are all agreed that it is the best way forward given its merits. Speaking, Ikpeazu expressed his hope for the eventual emergence of a new Nigerian nation that would work for everyone and lauded Saraki and his group for forming an alliance that would be in the interest of the country and encouraged all PDP presidential aspirants to come together in the interest of Nigeria.
