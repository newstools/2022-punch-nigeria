A robber threatened to cut off former England full-back Ashley Cole’s fingers with a pair of pliers during a violent break-in at his home, a court was told Monday. Nottingham Crown Court heard Cole, 41, was led around the house in just a pair of shorts as intruders demanded jewellery in January 2020. Kurtis Dilks, 34, is accused of being a member of a four-strong gang who smashed their way into Cole’s home with a sledgehammer. Jurors were told Cole and his partner Sharon Canu each had their hands bound by cable ties, and the court was shown CCTV of the intruders leading Cole, who played for both Arsenal and Chelsea, down the stairs. The court was told that among the items stolen during the break-in were cash, mobile phones and watches. Dilks is accused of robbing Cole and Ms Canu, as well as allegedly raiding the home of former Tottenham and Derby midfielder Tom Huddlestone with co-defendants Ashley Cumberpatch and Andrew MacDonald. Prosecuting lawyer Michael Brady said although Cole had been at home with his family “the robbers were clearly not deterred by his presence”. He added Cole told his partner to call the police, which she did after hiding in a wardrobe. The prosecutor continued: “The next thing Ms Canu knew was when one of the robbers opened the wardrobe door and took the phone from her while she was talking to the police. Copyright PUNCH.
