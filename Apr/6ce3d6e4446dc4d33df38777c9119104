Silk Sonic, the group project of Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak, pulled an upset Sunday to win the Grammy for Song of the Year for their single “Leave The Door Open”. It was the third Grammy of the night for the super-duo, who channeled velvety R&B crooners on their throwback hit. They bested a crowded field that included pop queens Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo. Mars – a long-time Grammy darling with 11 wins to his name before this year — shared the coveted prize honoring best songwriting with collaborators including Paak. Mars and Paak toured together in 2017, before announcing in 2021 that they had formed a band and produced an album. Silk Sonic debuted at last year’s Grammys, performing “Leave The Door Open” along with a tribute to the late legend Little Richard. Mars and Paak’s project is something of a 1970s revival group that sees the musicians who’ve separately found solo fame look the part, sporting polished disco garb as they croon.
