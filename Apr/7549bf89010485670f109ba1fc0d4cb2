An Enugu State governorship aspirant under the Peoples Democratic Party, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, has called on the state’s party leadership to ensure a transparent primary ahead of the 2023 election. The former Deputy Senate President said this on Tuesday at a consultation meeting with PDP leaders in the state. Ekweremadu stated that a free and fair primary would ensure justice, equity, and peace among delegates and party members. He said, “I am here essentially to solicit votes because all members of the party’s state executive are statutory delegates, starting from the House of Assembly to the National Assembly, and ultimately the gubernatorial primaries. “I am also here to further advise them to ensure a free and fair process. I would love to see everybody at the end say that our delegates and primary elections were free and fair. That is the only way we can ensure justice, equity, and peace. Ekweremadu added that he looked forward to a productive exercise that would make the party united and stronger and called on PDP members to embrace democratic ideals. “I am looking forward to a process that will be very transparent and productive so that we can all go to the election after the primary as one strong house, undivided. “I am equally calling on all stakeholders and aspirants to various offices to toe the path of sportsmanship and democratic ideals of the PDP. That way, the PDP will emerge stronger,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
