A United States-based chartered accountant, Daniel Eke, has made public his ambition to contest the Abia State 2023 governorship election. Eke, a chieftain of the All Progressive Congress in the state said he was spurred by the level of retarded development in the state to join the governorship race. He made his intentions known to members of the party in Umuahia, the state capital, on Friday. The governorship hopeful, pointed out that he was seeking the mandate of Abia to reclaim, restore and modernise the state. He said, “My decision to contest the governorship election was not a random one but it was a decision I reached after wide consultation with many Abia people. “I have the belief that with good leadership, the economy of our state can be turned around and that is a contract I want to enter with our people if I’m elected Governor. “As Governor, I will face key sectors of our economy, starting from commerce and industry, I will revisit the masterplans of the Ariaria international market in Aba, and reconstruct it to enable commercial activities to thrive. “We will look into the education sector and prioritise the payment of teachers’ salaries and ensure that our schools have a solid infrastructure for conducive teaching and learning. “Our administration will also provide a sound health care delivery for our people through public-private partnership with health care experts from outside the country. “We will also reduce youth unemployment through a knowledge-based skill acquisition”.
