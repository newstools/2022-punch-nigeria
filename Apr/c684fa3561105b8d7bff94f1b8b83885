A governorship aspirant in Benue State on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party, Mr Terver Akase, on Wednesday decried  the silence of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) on the plight of people of the state in the hands of Fulani herders. Akase said Buhari’s regime had abandoned the people of the state to be slaughtered like animals. Speaking with journalists in Makurdi, the former media aide to Governor Samuel Ortom wondered why the Presidency was quick to sympathise with other states affected by violence but failed to issue  statement to sympathise with the government and people of Benue State, particularly on the last Monday coordinated attacks by herdsmen in Guma, Logo and Tarka which led to the killing of 25 people. He said, “Just this morning, we read a statement from the Presidency sympathising with the people of Plateau State, which is the right thing to do. “We also sympathise with the people of Plateau State. “But we are shocked that two days after coordinated attacks took place in Benue, affecting Guma, Logo and Tarka Local Government Areas, the Presidency has not deemed it necessary to sympathise with the people of Benue State, and we are wondering; is Benue no longer part of this country? Why has the Federal Government chosen to abandon the people of the state?” He described the silence of the Presidency over the killings in Benue as betrayal of the people’s trust and votes which brought the president to power in 2015 and retained him in 2019.
