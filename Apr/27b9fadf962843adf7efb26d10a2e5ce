A social networking app, Wardchat, connecting voters from the same polling unit, ward, local government, and state across the nation has been launched. According to the Country Lead, Wardchat, Kunle Lawal, the app is a social network purposely built for an electoral community. In a statement, he said, “It is an effective and smart social network with custom features built on Nigeria’s electoral structure covering 36 states and the FCT, 774 Local Governments, 8000 wards, and over 176,000 polling units across the nation.” He added that the app is aimed at digitising the electoral space for proximal relationships using the smallest electoral unit as a determinant during registration. He stated, “We will play in the social media space where we have the foreign big techs like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and Opera News hub. “But what makes us different is the niche market we would be serving, which is Nigeria’s electoral community of over 73 million registered voters and over 120 million above voting age, our features are built for Nigeria’s electoral structure which isn’t an afterthought. “As of today, only Wardchat creates connections by matching user’s electoral profiles thereby helping to foster engagement among voters that lead to better electoral outcomes, targeted audience conversations, and ward-centric conversations.”
