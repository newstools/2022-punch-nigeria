Arsenal are reportedly in pole position in the race to prise Victor Osimhen away from Napoli in the summer. The 23-year-old has been heavily linked with a move away from Italy following another productive season in front of goal. Despite spending almost two months on the sidelines with a cheekbone fracture, he has still managed to score 16 times from 26 matches in all competitions. Mikel Arteta is desperate to bolster his attack in the upcoming transfer window with Folarin Balogun set to be the only centre-forward at his disposal. The Gunners allowed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to join Barcelona earlier this year after he was deemed surplus to requirements. Meanwhile, Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah are poised to depart when their contracts expire at the end of the campaign. Arsenal are known to be interested in Osimhen having extensively scouted the player this term. They are claimed to be battling Manchester United for his signature, with Cristiano Ronaldo, Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Edinson Cavani all facing uncertain futures. But in a boost for the North London outfit, it has been said that Arsenal are at the front of the queue to sign him. According to Gazzetta Dello Sport via Sport Witness, Arsenal are leading the race to sign Osimhen. They state that the club have ‘set their sights’ on the ex-Lille man, with technical director Edu desperate to thrash out a deal. Any potential transfer would mean teams meeting Napoli’s asking price of around £83m. Osimhen, who is tied down at Napoli until 2025, only joined the Serie A giants in 2020.
