Nigerian music producer and songwriter, Oluwaseyi Akerele, popularly known as Shizzi, has announced the end of his publishing deal with Sony Music. Akerele had on his Instagram page on Tuesday, called out his manager, Efe Ogbeni for keeping him in an “archaic” deal with the music publishing company for six years. The music producer claimed that he unknowingly signed the deal because Ogbeni never gave him the chance to choose his own attorney to properly inspect the contract back in 2016. “As of late last year, SonyATV said they were going to let me go only if he agrees with terms of termination,” he further revealed on Tuesday. On Friday, Shizzi announced on his Instagram page, that the said contract has officially ended. “I am extremely blessed and thankful that I’ve achieved my goal and I’m moving on to the next stage in my career,” he wrote. “I’m happy to announce that my contract has officially ENDED!!!” In the post, the music producer also thanked Sony Music Publishing “for their integrity” throughout the process. “I want to thank my team for representing me over the years in the best possible way through this whole journey. I couldn’t do this without my family, my wife! I want to thank everyone else for their support and well wishes. “Never stop believing in the true value of yourself, and don’t ever let ANYONE take charge of your destiny, It’s God given and I’m just getting started,” he wrote.
