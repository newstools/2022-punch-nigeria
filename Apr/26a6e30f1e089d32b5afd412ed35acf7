Justice Adepele Ojo of the Osun State High Court 1, Osogbo, has sentenced a former Commandant of the Osun State Disciplinary Corps, Mr Sola Oyedeji, to two years’ imprisonment with hard labour for stealing N3.1m meant for the salaries of members of the corps. Oyedeji was arraigned by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission under sections 390 and 467 of the Criminal Code Act and charged with 10 counts. The convict, whose trial commenced in 2011, was said to have failed to pay the salaries of members of the corps in May 2007 after it was released to him by the state government. A statement on Sunday by the ICPC spokesman, Mrs Azuka Ogugua, stated, “Oyedeji was alleged to have stolen the money when he failed to pay the salaries of members of the corps in May 2007 after it was released to him by the state government. “Justice Ojo sentenced Oyedeji to two years’ imprisonment with hard labour, but with an option of fine of N100,000 on each of the counts, including the refund of the amount stolen to the state coffers. His sentence is to run concurrently.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
