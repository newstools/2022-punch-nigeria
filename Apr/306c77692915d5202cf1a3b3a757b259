A Not-for- Profit-Organisation,  Help in Time Consults, has said early detection and treatment will help prevent death through cancer. Speaking in an interview about the 5km and 10km walk held in Lekki, Lagos, to raise funds to support cancer patients, the Chief Operating Officer, Help in Time Consult, Oluwasuyi Gbadegeshin, said no one needed to die through cancer. She stressed that the walk, titled, ‘United against Cancer,’ aimed at creating awareness about the early  prevention and treatment of cancer. “The walk is meant to create awareness for the prevention and treatment of cancer. So many people need care; we have N2m which might take care of three people. People have been treated for cancer. Cancer can be prevented, nobody should die because of cancer, and funds can be raised for them so they can be treated. Early detection at an early stage can still be treated. If it is treated and detected early, people can be saved.” She also advised women to ensure they get screened for cancer twice a year and from age 25. “Women should get screened for cancer every six months and from age 25, they can start the medical checkups,” she said. She explained that the Help in Time Consults had a mission to care for indigent cancer patients, raise cancer awareness, give free cervical screening and sponsorship of cancer care at all levels of care.
