The Ondo State Commander of the Ondo Amotekun Corps, Mr Adetunji Adeleye, has denied allegations that it clashed with men of the 32 Artillery Brigade of the Nigeria Army,  Akure, over some cows arrested for violating the state anti-open grazing law. Our correspondent witnessed the pandemonium at the Gaga Area of Akure, the state capital between the men of the 32 Artillery Brigade of the Nigeria Army,  Akure and the men of the State Security Network Agency also known as Amotekun corps on Tuesday evening. The residents of the area were said to be running for safety when they saw the men of the two security agencies arguing while some cows were said to have been arrested by the Amotekun corps for allegedly violating the state anti-open grazing law. However, Adeleye maintained that it was a minor argument that had been resolved. He said, “It is a lie, we didn’t have any clash with soldiers. There was no issue between us, there was a minor argument and we have resolved it. Saying we are clashing with each other is not true.” Meanwhile, one of the residents of the area, who identified himself as Ademola, narrated that the soldiers were seen arguing and the argument, was suspected to be over the arrested cows. “We saw both soldiers and Amotekun people arguing, we suspect they were arguing about some cows, which we believed were seized by the Amotekun corps. When the people saw them, everybody was running here and there. But later they left our area,” Ademola stated. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
