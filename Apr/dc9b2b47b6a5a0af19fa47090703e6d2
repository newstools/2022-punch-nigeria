The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has picked the All Progressives Congress’ N50m Governorship Nomination and Expression of Interest Forms. The governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Gboyega Akosile, disclosed this on his Twitter page on Friday. According to him, the lawmaker representing Ikeja Federal Constituency at the House of Representatives, James Faleke, picked the forms on behalf of Sanwo-Olu. He wrote, “The train is leaving the station. No one should stand in the way of progress. Two forms were picked today at the @OfficialAPCNg secretariat. Hon James Faleke picked on behalf of Gov @jidesanwoolu while former SGF Babachir Lawal picked on behalf of @officialABAT.”  The PUNCH had earlier reported that the Lagos State Governor’s Advisory Council, on Monday, April 18, gave nod to the second term bid of Sanwo-Olu. According to Akosile, the governor was also given a pass mark for staying true to the developmental agenda of the state. Following the GAC’s nod, the Chairman of the newly constituted Parks Management Committee in Lagos, Musiliu Akinsanya aka MC Oluomo, throw his weight behind the second-term bid of Sanwo-Olu. MC Oluomo, who is the former chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers in the state, also promised the governor of three million votes from members of the parks committee and their families. However, a Muslim rights advocacy group, the Muslim Rights Concern, opposed the GAC’s endorsement of Sanwo-Olu to seek reelection for a second term of four years in 2023. The group maintained that the governor’s endorsement by APC leadership in the state was against the principle of rotational governance. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
