The Owa Obokun of Ijesaland, Oba Gabriel Adekunle Aromolaran, has charged politicians to do away with the campaign of calumny against each other. The monarch, ahead of the July 16, Osun 2022 gubernatorial election, called on politicians to limit their campaigns to issues rather than mudslinging and casting aspersions on one another. He gave the advice while receiving the gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Senator Ademola Adeleke, in his palace at Ilesa. The monarch noted that the people of Ijesaland had always relied on the strength of the unity in the land to achieve development. He told the gathering that the Ijesas would speak with one accord at the polls. He also urged Adeleke to stand by his campaign promises if he emerged as the governor. Adeleke had earlier informed the royal father of his ambition and solicited his prayers. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
