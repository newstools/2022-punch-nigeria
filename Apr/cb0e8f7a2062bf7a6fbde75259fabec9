An aspirant for the Enugu State House of Assembly in the coming general elections, Mr Akaolisa Ogbe, has reportedly escaped an assassination attempt. An eyewitness, Mr Okeke Aruma, who disclosed this on Monday, said the assailants shot Ogbe at close range on Saturday. A group, Ogbe Akaolisa National Support Group, confirmed the attack in a statement signed by one Chief Christian Ezude. The statement read in part, “He was attacked and shot on Saturday, April 16, at Amechi. He was trailed in a Gestapo style, blocked at a petrol station and shot at point-blank range as he had just left the house of his uncle, a prominent stakeholder who had warmly received him. He had earlier consulted and visited meetings of several wards in his constituencies. But to the glory of the Almighty, he miraculously survived. “Ndi Enugu, is this the kind of politics we want? Ndi Enugu, are we going to burn everything down in our stake or quest for power?” The state police spokesman, Daniel Ndukwe, did not respond to a text message sent to his line on the incident as of the time of filing this report.
