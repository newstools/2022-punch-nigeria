Karim Benzema scored as extra-time goal that gave Real Madrid 5-4 aggregate lead in the extra time. Rodrygo’s late goal for Real Madrid had forced extra time in their Champions League quarter-final second leg against Chelsea on Tuesday after a rousing comeback by the holders. Trailing 3-1 after last week’s first leg at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea pulled one back early on through Mason Mount. Second-half strikes from Antonio Ruediger and Timo Werner looked to have put Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea into the semi-finals. But substitute Rodrygo volleyed home Luka Modric’s brilliant pass in the 80th minute as a pulsating tie went into another half an hour, with the score 4-4 on aggregate. Copyright PUNCH.
