To commemorate the International Women’s Month, a non-governmental organisation, Live Abundantly! in collaboration with Bature Brewery and El Padrino, has awarded full scholarships to 10 female students. The NGO explained that the initiative, ‘Equity and Equality Scholarships’ was to reinstate its commitment to women empowerment and  call for the importance of gender equity, diversity, and inclusion and the elimination of bias against women and girls in the workplace, institutions of learning and the community. The Equity and Equality Scholarship inaugurated on International Women’s Day, 2021, was established in honour of the first and only female Surveyor-General of Nigeria, the late Mrs Olayinka Adekoya, to support and bring to the fore the significance of women in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, particularly surveying, which is viewed as a male-dominated discipline. Announcing the winners, Adekoya’s daughter-in-law and granddaughters celebrated their grandmother’s legacy. The event, which was anchored by Oladotun Olagbadebo, a passionate female team member of Bature Brewery, had other speakers, including Mr  Kevin Conroy, founder Bature Brewery; Ms Uzo Umeh, founder of El Padrino; Mrs Ngozi Ezi-Ashi, Live Abundantly!
