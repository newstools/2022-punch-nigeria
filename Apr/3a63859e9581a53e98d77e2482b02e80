The United States Transportation Security Administration has appointed a Nigerian, Yemi Oshinnaiye, as its new Chief Information Officer. Oshinnaiye, who was the deputy CIO at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, was confirmed as TSA’s new permanent CIO. According to the Federal News Network, Oshinnaiye would assume office in May following the resignation of Russ Roberts, the outgoing CIO. Roberts, who had announced his retirement in December, had delayed it for a few months. However, he would hand over the baton to Oshinnaiye in early May. Oshinnaiye has been the deputy CIO at USCIS since March 2019, but worked at DHS previously from 2012 to 2017. He, however, went into the private sector for a short stint before returning to USCIS. During his tenure at USCIS, Oshinnaiye helped to head the plan to consolidate and improve how the agency made use of cloud services. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
