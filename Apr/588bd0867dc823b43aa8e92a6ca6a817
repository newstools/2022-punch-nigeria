Nollywood actor and reality TV star, Uti Nwachukwu has faulted a Nigerian man who forcefully cut his son’s dreadlocks. In a video which went viral on Sunday, a man was seen hitting his son while using a pair of scissors to cut the latter’s dreadlocks. In the process, the father was also raining insults on the teary young man, whose hair was being cut. Reacting to the video, Uti knocked those who supported the father’s act, as he blamed Africans for supporting abuse. Via his Instagram page, the actor said, “Africans are steadily supporting abuse! Later when this boy grows up and becomes an abusive friend, lover and boss. “We’ll begin to shout justice for –. It’s okay. Keep applauding abuse. It’s so progressive.” Sharing his experience as a child, the Big Brother Africa 2010 winner said, “I was never beaten by my parents as a child. Never! “These abused humans are coming here justifying a father hitting his child on the head and laying heavy curses on him! “This is why a lot of Nigerians are aggressive! They learned this sh*t from home! “Most are traumatised and they don’t know it! They actually think this is normal.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
