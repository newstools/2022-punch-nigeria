The former Chief Imam of Apo Legislative Quarters Mosque, Sheikh Muhammad Nuru Khalid, has reiterated his stance on the government’s reluctance or inability to deal with the issue of insecurity in Nigeria. Khalid was fired from his previous position over an anti-government sermon and not showing remorse. He said he doesn’t mind having any job or platform to talk, as he is more concerned about the orphans and widows produced on a daily basis due to the inaction of the government. Copyright PUNCH.
