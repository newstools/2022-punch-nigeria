Asisat Oshoala will be hoping to get her second Champions League goal of the season when Barcelona Femini visit Wolfsburg in the second leg of their UEFA Women’s Champions League match on Saturday (today). Oshoala returned from a two-month injury lay-off to feature for 17 minutes in her side’s 5-1 thrashing of the German side at Camp Nou last Friday. She came on for Jennifer Hermoso in the 73rd minute of the win. The champions will be hoping to round off their semi-final game in Germany and Oshoala, whose only goal in the competition came in the 4-1 win against her former team Arsenal on October 5, has only been able to make four appearances in this season’s campaign. She’ll be hoping to return to the starting line-up for her fifth appearance in the competition. Despite scoring just one goal, the Nigeria international has accumulated 12 shots and two assists in the games she’s played in the competition. Oshoala’s season has been plagued by recurring injuries. She picked her last injury while training with Nigeria in preparation for the 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifying play-off against Ivory Coast, which kept her out of action for 10 weeks. Before then, she had also been out of action for over two months due to a knee injury.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
