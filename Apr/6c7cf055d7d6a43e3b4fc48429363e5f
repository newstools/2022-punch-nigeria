Super Falcons striker, Asisat Oshoala, returned from an injury lay-off in Barcelona Femeni’s Champions League semi-final clash against Wolfsburg on Friday. A world record 91,648 crowd saw Barca claim a massive 5-1 first leg victory at the Nou Camp, easing pressure on the second leg next week. The 27-year-old was out of action due to a knee injury she sustained in training ahead of Nigeria’s Africa Women’s Cup of Nations qualifying encounter against Ivory Coast in February. She came in as a 73rd minute substitute, coming in for Jennifer Hermoso with the game at 4-1. Aitana Bonmati had put the defending champions ahead in the third minute, before Caroline Hansen doubled the lead seven minutes later. There were two quick goals for the Spanish side to take them 4-0 up, with the first one coming through Hermoso in the 33rd minute, followed by captain Alexia Putellas finding the back of the net five minutes later, taking a comfortable lead into half time. At the resumption of the second half, the visitors pushed for a goal and were rewarded when Jill Roor found the back of the net in the 70th minute. The goal however took a long VAR review before it was confirmed after the assistant referee had earlier ruled it out for offside. The Falcons stars had an opportunity to increase the tally for her side twice, but missed on both opportunities. The first was a one-one with the goalkeeper in the 81st minute, hitting the keeper’s leg. When another similar chance presented itself as a minute leader, the visiting keeper used the same method to stop Oshoala. Putellas scored one more goal for the home side with five minutes of normal time left, scoring from the spot after being brought down in the penalty box.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
