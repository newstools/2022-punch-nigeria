THE Lagos State Government has started training officers in the 57 Local Governments and Local Council Development Areas in registry management among others. The Permanent Secretary, Local Government Establishments, Training and Pensions Office, Mrs Kikelomo Bolarinwa, disclosed this on Tuesday during the workshop held at the Public Service Staff Development Centre, Magodo. She said, “Registry is a big part of the success of Ministries, Departments and Agencies and those that operate these registries have some constraints with the procedures involved, because if for example, files are not readily available, it is going to impact the efficiency and effectiveness of the various local governments. “That is why we want to commence this training this year with registry management because information management is something that ensures continuity of the system and we have chosen officers from across the state for this so that they will have the requisite skills that will ensure our records are up to date and revamp our record system.” The Acting Director of PSSDC, Mr Olufemi Osholaja, stated that registry procedures are the pillars on which public agencies operate. “Records keeping, records management and registry procedures are hallmarks of bureaucracy and what has made the public service to be a long lasting enduring institution is the fact that it is a bureaucratic organisation that relies more on records and also elements of seniority and authority and that is why most private sectors will collapse but public agencies such as local and state governments will not collapse, because of the rudimentary procedures of doing things,” he said.
