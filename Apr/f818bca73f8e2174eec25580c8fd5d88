Nigeria striker Cyriel Dessers scored a brace as he led Dutch side Feyenoord to a 3-2 win over Olympique Marseille in the first leg of their UEFA Europa Conference League semi-final tie at the Feyenoord Stadium on Thursday. The brace takes his tally to 10 goals in 11 games, becoming the competition’s top scorer ahead of AS Roma striker of Nigerian descent Tammy Abraham, who has found the back of the net eight times in the competition. Dessers put Feyenoord in front in the 18th minute and got his brace in the 46th minute to give his side the advantage going into the return leg in France next week. The 27-year-old one-cap Super Eagles striker has been the breakout star of the maiden edition of the competition with 10 goals and two assists in 11 games. The impressive Dessers came off for Alireza Jahanbakhsh in the 83rd minute. At the King Power Stadium, another Nigerian forward Ademola Lookman grabbed the equaliser as Leicester City held Roma 1-1 in the first leg of their Conference League the same day. His compatriot Kelechi Iheanacho, who came on for Jamie Vardy in the 62nd minute, fired blanks as he continues his search for his first Conference League goal. Lookman, who was in the starting line-up for the Foxes, came off for Ayoze Perez in the 85th minute of the draw. Also, Nigerians Joe Aribo and Calvin Bassey were in action for Glasgow Rangers in their UEFA Europa League goalless draw against Bundesliga side RB Leipzig in Leipzig on Thursday. Aribo made way for James Sands in the 83rd minute, two minutes before the hosts grabbed the winner courtesy of an Angelion strike to break Rangers fans’ hearts, ahead of the return fixture at Ibrox next week.
