The acquisition of MainOne has been finalised as Equinix Inc announced it has fully acquired the firm in a $320m deal. According to Equinix, this is a part of its long-term strategy to become an African carrier-neutral digital infrastructure company. In a statement, the firm said, “This acquisition will extend Platform Equinix® into West Africa, giving organizations based inside and outside of Africa access to global and regional markets. “Nigeria has both the largest population and the largest economy of any country in Africa, with approximately 142 million active Internet subscribers. Home to new innovative digital ecosystems in fintech and content and digital media, it has a great opportunity for expansion of digital services. “Equinix believes MainOne, headquartered in Lagos, to be one of the most exciting technology businesses to emerge from Africa, and Lagos is rapidly becoming a key connectivity hub for the wider West Africa region. Founded by Funke Opeke in 2010, the company has enabled connectivity for the business community of Nigeria and now has digital infrastructure assets, including three operational data centers, with an additional facility in Lagos expected to open in April 2022.” Copyright PUNCH.
