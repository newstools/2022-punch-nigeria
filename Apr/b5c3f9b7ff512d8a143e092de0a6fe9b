Super Eagles may play their 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying return leg against Sierra Leone at the Lansana Conte Stadium in Conakry, the capital of Guinea. Nigeria are in Group A for the AFCON qualifiers along with Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and Sao Tome and Principe or Mauritius. The Eagles are billed to begin their qualifying campaign against the Leone Stars in Nigeria in the first week of June and will be seeking a win after failing to defeat their West African counterpart during their qualifying series for the 2021 edition in Cameroon. Nigeria were previously expected to play the return leg of the encounter against Sierra Leone at the Freetown National Stadium but the facility is currently under construction which has led the Sierra Leone Football Association to look for other options. The SLFA have moved to secure another venue for their home matches and are considering the Lansana Conte Stadium. The SLFA on social media disclosed that the General Secretary of the association and three other members of the board are currently in Conakry to engage the Guinean Football Federation on the availability of the facility for their home games. “Four SLFA officials led by the General Secretary Chris Kamara are in Conakry, Guinea to engage the Guinean Football Federation on the use of the Lansana Conte Stadium for Sierra Leone’s home matches in the AFCON 2023 Qualifiers,” the SLFA tweeted. The two top-placed teams in each of the 12 groups at the end of the qualifying campaign will qualify for the 34th edition of the AFCON finals taking place in Ivory Coast in 2023. Copyright PUNCH.
