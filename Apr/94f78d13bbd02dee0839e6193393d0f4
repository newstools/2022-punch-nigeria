The first lady of Ondo state, Betty Akeredolu, has said the Imo East senatorial district would experience even development should the people of the zone elect her as the next senator of the zone. Akeredolu who spoke to Journalists in Owerri on Friday said that Owerri zone and particularly her maiden home, Emeabiam, in the Owerri West Local Government Area of the zone was underrepresented. She said that successive administrations in Imo state had neglected the zone, stating that she was out to fill the years eaten by the locusts. According to her, being married to the governor of Ondo State shouldn’t deprive her of the right to play politics in Imo state. She said, “I am vying for the Senate of Imo East to change the narratives about the Owerri zone. Yes, I am married to the governor of Ondo state but that shouldn’t deprive me of the right to seek to represent Imo East which is my maiden senatorial district. “I am proud to come from Emeabiam in Owerri West LGA of Imo state. Our biggest challenges are roads and hospitals, but I am happy that I have been able to attract a 10.5 kilometres of roads in Emeabiam at the cost of N16bn. I am grateful to the NDDC. “I have been married since 1980 but I have remained in touch with my people in Owerri zone. Being married to a Yoruba man didn’t cut my tiles with my father’s people. I know that my going to the senate will attract huge infrastructural development for the people of Imo East nay Imo State.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
