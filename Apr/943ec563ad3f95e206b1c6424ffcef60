Scores of members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers in Ondo State on Thursday protested against the alleged interference of the state government in the affairs of the union. The protesters alleged that the state government is planning to impose the immediate past chairman of the union, Mr Jacob Adebo, for a second term in office. The aggrieved drivers, who converged on Owo, Owo Local Government Area of the state, alleged that there was a ploy by some individuals in government to use state resources to proscribe the union if members opposed the imposition of the immediate past chairman. The leader of the protesters, Gbenga Ijalade, stated that the protest became necessary to draw the attention of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu to the alleged imposition and proscription plan by some faceless people in his administration. He said, “We won’t fight if they proscribe our union, but we will wait till election season when we will choose the candidate that will not punish us. “They have been threatening us that if we do not allow them to impose Jacob Adebo on us, they will proscribe our union. “Adebo has one vote among over 5,000 drivers in our state. The majority decides, but they want to impose. From our work, we send our children to school. We will adhere strictly to the court judgment. We have resolved not to withdraw the case from the court.” The union, however, advised the state government to allow the constitution of the union to take its full course. Copyright PUNCH.
