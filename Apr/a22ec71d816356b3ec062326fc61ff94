The All Progressives Congress Thursday in Abuja said the money stolen at its national secretariat on Wednesday does not belong to the party. It also said the money is not related to the proceeds from the sale of Nomination and Expression of Interest forms. The party’s National Publicity Secretary, Felix Morka, disclosed this in a statement he signed late Thursday, titled ‘Re: Lost money at APC national secretariat’. On Wednesday, The PUNCH had reported a theft of about $75,000 at the APC national secretariat. Reacting to the reports on Thursday, the party said, “On Wednesday, April 27, 2022, a sum of $50,000 was reported lost by an individual around the entrance gate of the National Secretariat of the party. “To be clear, the lost money does not belong to the Party. In any event, the fee for the said forms is set and denominated in Naira not US Dollars. “The loss is neither connected with proceeds of sale of forms nor with relocation of the venue for the collection of Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms from the secretariat grounds to the International Conference Centre.” Morka noted that the party’s decision to relocate the venue for collection of forms to the ICC was to ease heavy human and vehicular traffic around the secretariat with teeming aspirants and their supporters who thronged the secretariat to collect forms. “As widely advertised and reported in major news outlets, all purchases of forms are payable to designated bank accounts of the party,” the statement read.
