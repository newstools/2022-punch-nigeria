An outbreak of cholera has been recorded in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State. Residents said the outbreak was first recorded in Rikkos community in the council area and that the number of infected persons has risen to 20. A health official in the community confirmed the development to The PUNCH in Jos on Tuesday. The official who attributed the outbreak to broken water pipes as a result of the ongoing construction of overhead bridge, forcing locals to resort to drinking water from the dam, said, “It has come to my notice that there is an outbreak of cholera within Rikkos community, which more than 20 people were affected. “It is the result of the overhead bridge that is under construction at British American Junction. “All the main water pipelines were removed. People are fetching water directly from the Lamingo Dam, without any filtering. There is the possibility that other communities will be at risk. This is an early warning sign.” The official called on the government to sensitize the people on the dangers of drinking water directly from the dam. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Ninkong Lar, did not take his calls when efforts were made to contact him on the matter.
