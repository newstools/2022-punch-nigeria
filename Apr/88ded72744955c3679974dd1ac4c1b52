Traders in Akwa Ibom State are seeking the release of another batch of state-sponsored non-interest loans to cushion the effect of the losses suffered because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The traders added that there was a need for the creation of a desk office for traders in all the 31 local government councils of the state as well as the creation of the office of the Senior Special Assistant to the governor on trade matters. The President of the association in the state and Special Assistant to the Akwa Ibom Governor on Trade and Market Matters, Mr Idorenyin Raphael, said this while speaking at the Nigerian Traders Summit and Trade Exposition themed, ‘Growing an Inclusive Economy: The Cooperative Way.’ He said, “Let me specifically thank you for your fatherly disposition to traders in Akwa Ibom state. I am glad to stand before you to count our blessings. “The provision of the N2bn interest-free loan for traders under their cooperative societies to expand our trading activities has really lifted the fortunes of traders in the state. Some of the traders have received processing equipment to produce and package their products for sales with attendant good profit after-sales. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
