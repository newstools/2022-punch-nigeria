A Peoples Democratic Party’s presidential aspirant, Peter Obi, has blamed Nigerian leaders for economic failure. Obi, a former Anambra State Governor, said Nigeria has to focus more on production formulas than on sharing formulas to salvage the country’s economic situation. Speaking in Asaba during his visit to national delegates of the Delta State chapter of the PDP, Obi urged delegates to vote for him as the party’s flag bearer for the presidential polls in 2023. He said, “All we do is share; nobody talks about the production formula; that is what we want to change. This country ought to be productive; that is what I want us to do. “Nigeria is collapsing. It is collapsing fast; unless we do something, we will all be refugees, and none of you can afford to be refugees. “To anybody that tells you that things are getting better in this country, tell the person Peter Obi said it is not true. “All we hear is killing, kidnapping, and everything you see in Nigeria is a cumulative effect of leadership failure.” If Nigeria had invested wisely, there would be no insecurity or agitation in Niger Delta”. He urged delegates to think about their children’s future while casting their votes during the primaries, saying that they would not be Chairman or delegates forever; what you do know affects the lives of generations to come.
