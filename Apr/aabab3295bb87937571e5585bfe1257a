The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said his administration is creating opportunities for technological entrepreneurship in the state. Sanwo-Olu disclosed this on Wednesday during the inauguration of Mainone/MDXI new data centre in Lagos, according to a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Gboyega Akosile The governor noted that with job creation, knowledge and skills acquired by those employed in the facility would aid them to compete with their counterparts on a global level. He said, “Lagos is the heartbeat and commercial nerve centre of the country, therefore, we will continue to support investors and create an enabling environment for their businesses to flourish. “On our part as government, we are ensuring that our policies are designed to support private investment and create unending opportunities for entrepreneurs and investors. We are also putting our skin in the game. We have reached advanced stages of the rollout of 3,000km of terrestrial fibre across the state. I am aware that MainOne also has a similar network of over a thousand kilometers, part of which is in Lagos. “We are developing a Knowledge Innovation Technology Entrepreneurship Cluster/Campus in Yaba, Lagos, on 22,000 square meters of land, in partnership with the private sector. We have just established a new university, the Lagos State University of Science and Technology, focused on building capacity in science, technology, and innovation in Lagos State.” The Managing Director,  Mainone/MDXI, Funke Opeke, described the new facility as a hub of digital economy in West Africa, noting that Mainone/MDXI landed its first Marine cable in Lagos and opened its first data center also in Lagos and West Africa.
