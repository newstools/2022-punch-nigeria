The Lagos State Council of Tradesmen and Artisans in partnership with StartUp and FinishRich Impact Concept, has disclosed its plans to recognise the contribution of artisans and tradesmen to the economy. The coordinator of the event, Mr Rabiu Momoh, said this in a statement on Thursday, adding that the immense contribution of the informal sector cannot be underestimated in Lagos. He said, “Over the years, artisans and tradesmen have been looked down on and treated with disdain, and this is partly because of their express values, such as lackadaisical attitude, lack of integrity and honesty, failure to keep to time among others, and they, in turn, have grown to accept this derogatory appellation. This public perception has greatly rubbed off on their personality negatively. “To change this perception and reconstruct their social identity, their values must be acknowledged, recognised, and celebrated. Based on the foregoing, Startup and FinishRich Impact Concept with our partner, Brand Connect Media on one hand; and Lagos State Council of Tradesmen and Artisans, Nigerian Automobile Technicians Association and other Trades associations are organising the ‘Artisans and tradesmen recognition awards’ in June, 2022. “The award ceremony scheduled for Agege stadium which coincides with the 25th anniversary of LASCOTA will be given to various stakeholders who have contributed to the upliftment of this informal sector.” Copyright PUNCH.
