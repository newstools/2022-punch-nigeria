Abidemi Ogunnusi, the widow of the late preacher who slumped and died while preaching, Francis Ogunnusi, said she was in the church and witnessed how her husband slumped and died on the pulpit. Abidemi who betrayed her emotion while speaking with newsmen in Abeokuta said she was shocked when she saw her husband slump on the pulpit while preaching. She added that she joined a few other pastors to pray for his restoration while he was being taken to a nearby hospital. Ogunnusi was reported to have slumped and died while preaching on death on Sunday at the Evangelical Church Winning All, in the Onikoko area of Abeokuta. The widow said, “It is a thing of shock, it is an unending film in my life. I pray we live long to reap the fruits of our labour but he couldn’t, he did not, it is sudden, because we both laboured together. “He was supposed to be reaping his labours now that things are getting better for the entire family, the extended family, this now happened. “It is a season film, it’s a shock to me and I pray God will take care of me, the children and all the family he left behind.” The widow, who described her husband as loving, noted that there was no sign of sickness or weakness before his sudden death. She said, “My husband, Oluwole Francis Ogunnusi is a very caring, loving husband with an act of humility. Open-minded, he is ready to satisfy others before himself, that’s him. “There was no strange sign. He was healthy and agile. I haven’t watched the trending clip about my husband’s death but I was in the church while he was preaching and there was no sign of tiredness or weakness.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
