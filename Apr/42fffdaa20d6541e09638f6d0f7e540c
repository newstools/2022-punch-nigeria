The police in Rivers State on Friday said they arrested four persons, including members of an armed robbery gang terrorising residents of Rumuagholu Estate, in the Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of the state. The acting spokesperson for the state police command, Grace Iringe-Koko, who disclosed this in a statement in Port Harcourt said the suspects operated during the day, harassing and dispossessing people in the area of their belongings. Iringe-Koko, however, said the police swooped on the suspects on Thursday following a distress call. “The two suspects, Wisdom John, 20 years; and Anietie Stephen, 26, were apprehended, while two others narrowly escaped. Items recovered at the scene included various laptops and phones stolen from the residents, as well as a Volkswagen Golf car with reg. no. AH 757 NEM, used for the operation by the suspects. An investigation is ongoing to arrest other fleeing suspects “Similarly, operatives of the command arrested two suspects for receiving a stolen ash-coloured Honda Accord belonging to the Rivers State Government. The vehicle, which was snatched at gunpoint by four armed men at D/Line, Port Harcourt, on April 3, 2022, was recovered around the Abuloma axis in Port Harcourt by the officers. “The suspects, one Saidu Adamu, aka Alhaji Sani, 30; and Mohammed Sani, 62, were arrested in possession of the stolen vehicle in the evening of the same day,” the statement added.
