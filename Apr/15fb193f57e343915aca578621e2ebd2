Arsenal are one of the two clubs Victor Osimhen is dreaming of playing for amid speculation over the striker’s Napoli future, according to a report from Corriere dello Sport. Osimhen is amongst the raft of strikers to have been linked with a move to the Emirates this summer. Of course, the Gunners need to sign at least one new goalscorer during the coming months. Reports in March claimed that Arsenal dreamt of signing the Nigerian. It comes after a campaign in which he has scored 16 goals in 28 games in all competitions. Unsurprisingly, they are not ready to let him go on the cheap at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. In fact, reports have suggested that they want £84 million for the 23-year-old. That would make the forward Arsenal’s record signing if he did move to North London. And it now seems that Osimhen is indeed hoping that Mikel Arteta’s men come calling. According to Corriere dello Sport, Osimhen is dreaming of either moving to Arsenal or Manchester United this summer. Signing Osimhen would excite a lot of Arsenal supporters. He has been described as a ‘phenomenal‘ striker. And he has an impressive record over his career. But clearly, his asking price makes such a move a gamble. Arsenal ideally need to sign more than one goalscorer during the coming months. And clearly, that would be a lot more difficult if he joins for £84 million. Much may depend on how much Arsenal have to work with over the summer. And they will surely be hoping that Napoli are open to a compromise on the price. But there is no question that it is encouraging that the striker apparently dreams of playing for Arsenal.
