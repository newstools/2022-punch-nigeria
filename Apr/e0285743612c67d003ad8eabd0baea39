The Peoples Democratic Party in Rivers State on Wednesday denied allegations that it was hoarding intent and nomination forms after payment from some of its members aspiring for various elective positions were denied . The PDP state Publicity Secretary, Tambari Gbara, who made the denial in a statement, raised doubts “if they are actually members of our party, because if they are, they would have been better informed.” The PUNCH had reported that about 40 persons who said they were members of the party vying for the state House of Assembly protested in front of the party’s secretariat, Aba Road in Port Harcourt over alleged exclusion. The aspirants who displayed their bank drafts alleged that they were asked to come to the office to collect their firms, but were surprised that no party official was in the secretariat to attend to them, saying the party was treating them with disdain. Gbara said, “We want to state it clearly here that all forms are printed and sold at the national secretariat in Abuja as approved by National Executive Committee and the National Working Committee of the Party. “Our state secretariat is not selling forms and has no business with the sales of forms, only the National Secretariat is saddled with the responsibility of doing so. The truth is that aspirants in the state with the intention to buy forms were directed on how to go about it and obtain their forms, no money was paid to PDP, Rivers State chapter for nomination forms.” He further said it absurd for a group of people storm the secretariat, without prior notice, making “frivolous claims of paying money to the national secretariat of our party and were told to come and pick up their forms in Port Harcourt.”  Copyright PUNCH.
