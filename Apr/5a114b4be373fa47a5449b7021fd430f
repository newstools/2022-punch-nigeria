The wife of the Ondo State Governor, Betty Akeredolu, has vowed to get justice for a housewife, Iyanu Oluwaseun, whose husband poured hot water on her. It was gathered that the incident happened while the couple engaged in an argument which led to a fight at their residence in Owo, the headquarters of Owo Local Government Area of the state. The husband was said to have been arrested by the men of the state police command while the victim was taken to a hospital for treatment. The wife of the governor condemned the alleged act, describing it as bestial and intolerable. Akeredolu, in a statement by the Special Assistant to the Governor on New Media and Archives, Debo Akinbami, said the act was shameful and could not be justified under any guise. According to the statement, the Ondo State Agency Against Gender-Based Violence was already handling the case to ensure justice was served. The statement read, “The spate of spousal violence in the country is disturbing and regrettable. The narrative is both sad and sour. We cannot continue like this. “Women should, at once, accept the fact that it is foolhardy to indulge abusive spouses to the detriment of their mental and physical health. “Why die in an abusive marriage? Women should speak up against abuse and possibly walk out of deleterious relationships.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
