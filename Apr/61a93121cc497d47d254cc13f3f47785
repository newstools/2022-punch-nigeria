Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, and the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, on Saturday, reiterated the need for Nigerians to embrace one another and strive for unity, saying peace remained the greatest catalyst for development. The governor and the monarch urged Nigerians to embrace one another and fight for the unity and stability of the nation, saying peace and unity were required to uplift Nigeria. They spoke at Ilawe Ekiti during the 10th coronation anniversary of the Alawe of Ilawe Ekiti, Oba Ajibade Alabi, which featured the launch of the community’s N300million Plantain/Banana Processing Company and the launch of the monarch’s autobiography. Fayemi, who lauded the Alawe for combining royalty with intellectualism, said the banana industry initiated by the community would help in processing agricultural produce in the state to finished products and boost the economy at the local level. Oba Ogunwusi, who praised the Alawe for ushering development in Ilawe Ekiti in the last one decade, urged residents “to come together and work for the progress of this town, Ekiti State and Nigeria.” Copyright PUNCH.
