Hoodlums have attacked the Amichi Divisional Police Headquarters in Nnewi-South Local Government Area of Anambra State. The State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, confirmed the incident to newsmen on Friday. The attack came barely 24 hours after the administrative headquarters of the same LGA was attacked, leaving one person dead. The reason for the Friday attack, however, remains unknown. The police station was still undergoing reconstruction as it was among the stations attacked during the 2020 EndSARS protest. The Force’s PPRO, however, noted that there was no casualty recorded in the assault and that a team of personnel had been drafted to the area to ensure calm and safety. He urged residents in the area with useful information to make them available to the police to further help in the ongoing investigation that would ensure the perpetrators of these dastardly acts were brought to book.
