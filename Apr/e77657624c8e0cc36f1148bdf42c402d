The acting Controller-General of the Federal Fire Service has called on Nigerians to be cautious of fire as Christians celebrate Easter. Karebo made the call in a statement by the FFS Public Relations Officer, Mr. Paul Abraham, on Saturday in Abuja. He advised Christians on the need to take adequate precautions while cooking, to prevent fire incidents.
Karebo said that because the festivity involved the use of more constant gas, electricity, charcoal, and other burning materials, it was important not to get carried away while using anything combustibles. He said, “Don’t leave cooking unattended, keep matchsticks away from children, and keep gas cylinders outside the kitchen among other measures. “All these, and more must be complied with to avoid fire incidences during the celebration as fire could dangerously disrupt the joy that comes with Easter.” He said that he had directed all fire service commands to be on red alert to ensure quick response to emergencies during the Easter celebration. Karebo urged citizens to familiarise themselves with the fire service closest to their place of residence by getting the contact number of appropriate persons in case of a fire emergency. NAN
