The National Executive Council of the All Progressives Congress, Wednesday in Abuja, transferred power to the Abdullahi Adamu-led National Working Committee until July 2022. The party’s secretary, Dr Iyiola Omisore, disclosed this to delegates at the 11th National Executive Committee meeting of the APC holding at Transcorp Hilton, Abuja. With this transfer of power, the NWC would be at liberty to make decisions that would ordinarily require the approval of the NEC for the next 90 days. According to Omisore, the Senate President, Dr Ahmed Lawan, moved the motion which was seconded by Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai. In attendance are the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, members of the NWC, Progressive Governors Forum, Party State Chairpersons, amongst others. The NEC meeting is the first the APC is holding after its much-anticipated National Convention held on March 26, where the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee was dissolved and new leadership was sworn-in by the President.
