The Vice-Chancellor of the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Professor Kolawole Salako, has called on Nigerians to continue to imbibe the spirit of love, tolerance, and harmony. Salako made the call in his Easter Monday goodwill message, signed by the institution’s Head of Directorate of Public Relations, Mr. Kola Adepoju. He charged Nigerians to reflect on the essence and lessons of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ by embracing and living a life of peace and sacrifice. The Vice-Chancellor admonished the staff and students of the university and citizens at large to shun rancor and acrimony. He reiterated that the development and progress of FUNAAB and Nigeria, in general, depended largely on love and unity among stakeholders, irrespective of political and religious affiliations. “The triumph of our Lord is widely considered to be God’s plan to save people from sins and wrongdoings. The season is all about the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. “We have a God and Creator who is aware of every concern of our hearts. No leader is granted power that is not a part of His plan. “No trial is faced that is not allowed for a reason. We can certainly be comforted by our faith and rely on His words through the scriptures, which assure us that all things are created for the ultimate good of those who love and trust in Him. “We also always endeavour never to take for granted the blessing of each opportunity we’re given to oversee the affairs of our great university. We thank each of the strata of staff for their continued support and loyalty to the system. “Let us come together to pray to the Lord for lasting peace in our university, Ogun state, and Nigeria as well as happiness in our lives,” he said.
