The pilots, our correspondent learnt, were on a training session when the incident happened at the NAF base in Kaduna. Efforts to get the NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, were not successful. He is yet to respond to a message sent to him on the matter.
