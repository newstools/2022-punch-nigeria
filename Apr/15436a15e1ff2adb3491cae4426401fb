The All Progressives Congress, on Friday in Abuja, said it was yet to determine where it wants to zone its presidential ticket to. The Party’s National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, disclosed this to State House Correspondent shortly after he presented the party’s governorship candidate in the forthcoming Ekiti governorship election, Biodun Oyebanji, to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. When asked where the governing party would be zoning its presidential ticket to, Adamu said such a decision is beyond the National Working Committee and is the prerogative of the entire party, which, he acknowledged, is bigger than the chairman. According to him, “I am today privileged to be the chairman of the party. The party is greater than me. The party has not made a decision and I cannot preempt what the party decision will be.” Adamu was accompanied to the Presidential Villa by the Ekiti State Governor and Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum, Dr Kayode Fayemi; Kebbi State governor and Chairman of the Progressive Governors’ Forum, Atiku Bagudu; and the National Secretary of the APC, Senator Iyiola Omisore.
