The Federal Capital Territory said it had investigated and discovered the source of the attack on the members of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders’ Association in Gwagwalada Area Council. No fewer than four members of the association, including their chairman, were killed last week. They were said to be coming from Izom market in Niger State when the gunmen attacked them near Daku village in the area council of the FCT. Four other persons were said to have been abducted while several others sustained gunshot injuries. The Secretary-General of MACBAN, NgelzeermaUsman, told our correspondent that their abductors are demanding N100 million for the release of those held hostage. Giving an update on the matter on Monday, the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Operations, Ben Igwe, disclosed that their assailants targeted them to collect their money. He, however, assured that the police was on top of the situation. Igwe said, “They trailed them and collected the money of the cows they sold from them. We are working on it. We have discovered the source and we would ensure they are apprehended. I don’t want to disclose what we are doing on the matter.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
