Nigerian striker Terem Moffi says defenders now have eyes on him following his impressive debut season with FC Lorient and admitted he has struggled to replicate his excellent first season form this term. After joining Lorient from Kortrijk for €8m, Moffi had an outstanding first campaign with Les Merlus as he played a key role in helping the French outfit escape relegation. The 22-year-old was the revelation of the French Ligue 1 in the 2020/21 season after bagging 14 goals. Moffi has, however, only managed to score just seven league goals and four assists in 30 league games. In an interview with Le Telegramme, Moffi admitted that he had struggled to discover his best form, but added he would continue to work hard. He said, “When you score 14 goals, you are a threat to them. So, yeah, I think they have more of an eye on me. The defenders say to themselves that they must not take their eyes off me, let me go in the back. “Sometimes you lack confidence and things don’t go your way. For example, you can face the keeper, dribble but shoot wide. It’s something that all players know, and it’s quite difficult to live with. “As a scorer, it stresses you out. When you play in this position, you have to score, prove. So, when it’s not, you wonder what’s going on. But we must continue to be positive, work hard, even harder, even, to find the net. You have to stay strong mentally, but I am strong enough, have confidence and work as much as possible.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
