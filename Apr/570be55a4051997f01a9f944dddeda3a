HOME and business security firm, PrimeAlert Secure Limited, says it will continue to leverage technology to tackle insecurity and other related challenges. The company said this while unveiling a tech device designed to tackle insecurity. The firm’s Managing Director, Mr Tony Nwulu, in a statement on Sunday, said the company had also established relationships with security agencies to provide urgent responses to burglary and fire alarm notifications. He was quoted to have spoken at the unveiling of the tech device in Lagos. “With the increasing insecurity in Nigeria and the boom in private security protection, we set out to build a brand that places prime importance on protecting the lives and properties of our clients at the same time, supporting state institutions and security agencies in their primary role of fighting worsening insecurity in Nigeria. “The home and business security market has seen substantial growth in the past, and has tremendous potential for further growth. Our goal is to further enhance our network of distributors and partners in Nigeria and across West Africa and to extend our services to the largest number of customers possible by being closer to them,” Nwulu said. He added that the firm would continue to leverage technology to protect lives and properties in the country. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
