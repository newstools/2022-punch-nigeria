Former Nigerian Ambassador to Philippines, Yemi Farounbi, has said the country’s foundational problems must be addressed to reposition it on the path to development. Farounbi said the numerous problems confronting Nigeria including worsening insecurity could be solved if the structural problems were addressed. He said this at a meeting of The Nigerian Agenda held in Ibadan on Tuesday. He urged Nigeria to return to true federalism, saying this would assist in addresing the country’s problems and put it above its challenges He said there would be no positive change if the foundational problems were not addressed before electing another president no matter the good intentions of such leader He said, “We have to return to true federalism. It is one of the things we must address. No matter how good the President we get in 2023, there won’t be changes of the structural issues remain unsolved.” The coordinator of the TNA, Niyi Akinsiju, in his address said a credible candidate, who would lead Nigerians in attitudinal change should be elected as the president. He said, “As a united county our choice of leadership should be guided by capacity, capabilities, good conduct and character of who we are going to invest in. “Nigeria’s present and future needs to be determined by the will of the people. The country is currently being run against the will of the people, as the constitution serving as the social contract of the country is lopsided without any input from the people. Addressing Nigeria’s constitutional deficiency is the first step to addressing the national question and consequently pursuing the Nigeria Agenda. “All other efforts aimed at solving our challenges is tantamount to putting the horse before the cart. The structural and systemic inefficiencies would continue to stall progress and breed disunity.” The Director-General National Prosperity Movement, Ahmed Sajoh, said the only key to unlocking the potentials of the country is good leadership.
