There was ecstasy in some parts of Gombe State on Saturday when a former governor of the state, Ibrahim Dankwambo, returned three years after he left the state. Dankwambo, a former Accountant General of the Federation and member of the Peoples Democratic Party, is the predecessor to the incumbent governor, Muhammadu Yahaya, of the All Progressives Congress. The former governor who was absent at Yahaya’s swearing-in in 2019, had refrained from speaking, despite allegations of financial recklessness against him by the APC-led government. He had said he would react at the appropriate time. PDP chieftains and his supporters thronged the Gombe Airport to welcome him, a development that led to a gridlock in the metropolis. He waved at his supporters before heading for his vehicle. In a brief interview with journalists at the airport, the PDP chairman in the state Maj. Gen. Abner Kwaskebe (retd.), said the former governor’s achievements were immeasurable. “We made a mistake in 2019 and we should not repeat the same mistake in 2023; we should get ready,” Dankwambo said at the party secretariat. He also said he would purchase presidential form if his supporters urge him to participate in the 2023 election. He added, “If they want me to purchase the form I will go and get the forms. We will consult, including you people, if you think I can be president. They are still selling the form until Friday, but I’m prepared and ready to make sacrifices. “Let me thank you for coming out to receive me, I didn’t invite anybody, I didn’t tell anybody I was coming; I just came to pay homage to people, extend condolences in some places, share goodwill and good spirit to the people of Gombe.” Copyright PUNCH.
