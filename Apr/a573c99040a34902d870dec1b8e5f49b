The Federal Government, on Thursday in Abuja, said Nigerian students whose programmes were interrupted by the Russia-Ukraine war would continue their studies online and physically in other universities who have offered admission to students who wish to continue elsewhere. Speaking at the 36th Session of the State House Briefing on Thursday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gabriel Aduda, noted that, asides from universities who have begun virtual classes since the conflict broke out, other universities in neighbouring states (with similar curricular to Ukraine’s) have offered Nigerian students admission to complete their studies. Aduda, however, explained that all admission processing must be done through the Nigerian Missions as this would be the surest way to confirm that interested students were previously enrolled into various programmes in Ukraine. Aduda said, “Some universities have continued their classes online. But also, some universities in neighbouring countries, such as Romania, have reached out to us to offer placement to our students who want to continue their studies physically. “However, all processing must be done through that Nigerian Missions. That’s the only way these nations can know that the students were in Ukraine. “Education desks are being set up in our missions and the government is happy to help them (students) get placement in universities that have offered to help. “The forms will be available to students. A lot of students are being taken in. In Romania, some universities have opened their hostels to Nigerian students fleeing the war to continue their studies.” Details later… Copyright PUNCH.
