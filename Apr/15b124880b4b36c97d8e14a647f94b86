Gunmen have invaded the Igboukwu Cattle Market in Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State, killing over 20 cows and goats. It was gathered that the gunmen headed for the market on Thursday night shortly after razing the Aguata council secretariat. A video trending on social media also showed dead cows and goats at the cattle market, with traders bemoaning their losses. A source told City Round that though no human life was lost, the hoodlums opened fire on the cows and goats in the ranch. A resident in the area, Mr Iyke Orji, said the cows belonged to an Igbo businessman. “The unidentified gunmen, after burning the Aguata local government secretariat, plied through Ekwulobia and headed straight for Igboukwu. Stopping at Igboukwu, there’s a cattle ranch where over 30 cows were sold. Those cows belong to an Igbo man. The gunmen entered there and killed the cows there.’’ The state police spokesperson, Tochukwu Ikenga, confirmed the incident to City Round, saying it happened after the secretariat in Ekwulobia was torched by the gunmen. “It is an act of cruelty to the animals. What happened was that some elements on motorbikes on Thursday evening started shooting indiscriminately into the air and got to the cattle market and shot some cattle and goats. “We have extended our surveillance to that area and our men are already working. This is cruelty to animals and condemnable. The cattle in question are also owned by the people of the area,” Ikenga added.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
