Former Director-General, Media and Publicity to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, Salihu Tanko Yakasai, on Friday officially joined the People’s Redemption Party as a platform to pursue future political ambition. In a statement defending his decision to join the PRP, Yakasai stated that he pitched his tent with the party following its core ideologies and principles to emancipate the talaka from feudal, colonial and neo-colonial class oppression and absolute poverty. “The PRP is still alive and re-growing. Its message and performance in government continues to influence and inspire a new generation of politicians in this republic. I am part of the young generation of politicians that the party has inspired to retrace my steps and return home to the real struggle for redemption in Nigeria. “For me, these cardinal principles remain relevant to our struggle for emancipation in this moment, just as it was for our parents in northern Nigeria in particular, and the rest of the country at large during the first and second republics,” he said. According to Yakasai, he aligned himself with those he thought knew better. He added, “Like every novice politician, I looked up to those I thought were better experienced. I dutifully and respectfully followed them. That took me from one party to another: the All Peoples Party, then the All Nigeria Peoples Party, followed by the Congress for Progressive Change, all of which subsequently collapsed into the All Progressives Congress. “After careful consideration, consultation and deep reflection, I have decided to come back home to the politics of ideology and emancipation of the talaka. Today, I am officially joining the PRP as a member.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
