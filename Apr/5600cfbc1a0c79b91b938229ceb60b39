A total of 468 employees of LAPO Microfinance Bank were rewarded for their dedication to duty at the annual Long Service and Meritorious Award ceremony held at the weekend in Benin, Edo State. This year, employees who have completed 10-30 years of continuous service across the LAPO ecosystem were honoured. About 24 out of the 468 got best staff awards with automatic promotion. Other staff members also got monetary rewards and certificates attached to the awards. Chief Executive Officer of LAPO, Dr Godwin Ehigiamusoe, attributed the success of the company for over 30 years to the sacrifice of the staff, especially during and immediately after the COVID-19  challenge. He noted that despite the challenges in the economy in the past years, the company had tried to fulfil its commitment to the staff, assuring that it would continue to do so. “The award to the 468 staff is in recognition of their dedication to duty. The attributes of our staff have been responsible for our resilience for over 30 years. Our staff made huge sacrifices and immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic. “I congratulate them on achieving a significant milestone in their careers. It is a special occasion because we do not always have the opportunity to thank them in public for many years of service that have been devoted to the growth and development of LAPO,” he added. The organisation’s President of Staff Welfare Scheme, Amen Akenbor, also commended the staff who had worked with the company over the years, putting it in an enviable position as a foremost development institution in Nigeria. Some of the staff members commended the organisation for recognising their efforts towards its growth and promised to do more.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
