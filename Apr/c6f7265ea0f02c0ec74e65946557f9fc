The Executive Secretary, National Board for Technical Education, Prof. Idris Bugaje, has solicited the support of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission to curb the operation of illegal satellite polytechnic and monotechnic campuses across the country. The Executive Secretary made the call when he led a delegation of the Board on a courtesy visit to the Chairman of the ICPC, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, in Abuja, according to a statement by the Head of Media Unit of the NBTE, Hajiya Fatima Abubakar. In the statement issued in Kaduna on Tuesday, Bugaje was quoted to have said that the operation of the satellite campuses was one of the major challenges confronting the Technical and Vocational Education and Training(TVET) sector, explaining that the Board was mandated to coordinate all aspects of Technical Education in Nigeria. He noted that he had created the Polytechnic Inspectorate Department to monitor the illegal operations on campuses since he assumed duty. Recalling the recent stakeholders’ meeting on the operation of Vocational and Enterprise Institutions, Bugaje said the Board has resolved to convert VEIs and IEIs with requirements to monotechnics. In his response, the ICPC chairman pledged the Commission’s readiness to support the Board to curb the operation of the illegal institutions across the country. The ICPC boss urged the Executive Secretary to meet with Rectors of Polytechnics across the country to check the illegal operations of satellite campuses in Nigeria from the grassroots.
