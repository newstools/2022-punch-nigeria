A presidential aide, Tolu Ogunlesi, has tackled former Central Bank of Nigeria’s Deputy Governor and presidential aspirant, Kingsley Moghalu, on his plan to abolish multiple taxation if he becomes Nigeria’s president in 2023. The presidential hopeful had while selling his plans to Nigerians on his Twitter page on Thursday, said his government would reduce taxes and abolish “multiple, including informal taxation”. Aside from abolishing multiple taxation, he said his government, upon assuming office in 2023 if elected, would ensure those “who should pay taxes but don’t, actually pay”. He wrote, “As President of Nigeria from 2023 my government will reduce taxes and abolish multiple (including informal) taxation of small, overburdened businesses, but work to ensure that many millions who should pay taxes but don’t, actually pay. Many more people paying reduced taxes will.” But reacting to the plan, Ogunlesi who responded under the tweet, asked the presidential hopeful to explain how he (Moghalu) plans to abolish the informal subnational taxes in a federal system. “Prof, how do you intend to “abolish” informal SUB-NATIONAL taxes in a federal Democratic system?” Ogunlesi tweeted. However, Moghalu responded that he plans to reform the federal tax system and will collaborate with states through the National Economic Council. He wrote, “We will reform the federal tax system, and we will collaborate with states through the National Economic Council as part of a national approach to a national vision of the economy without taking away from the powers of sub-national units.”  Copyright PUNCH.
