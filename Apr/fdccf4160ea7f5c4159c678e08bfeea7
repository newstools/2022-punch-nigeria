THE Tutor-General/Permanent Secretary of the Lagos State Education District 1, Mrs Titilayo Solarin, has said the state government’s interventions boosted the results of students in the district. Solarin disclosed this on Wednesday, according to a statement, during an event held at the Government Senior College, Agege, to reward students who participated in academic competitions and co-curricular activities in 2021. She said. “In year 2021, the district in its external results rose from initial 38 per cent to 91 per cent in students’ results. This feat was made possible through the various interventions from the state government. The new inductees in the prestigious Students Diplomatic Corp as dean, ambassadors and delegates would spur a healthy rivalry among the students to put in more efforts in their academic and co-curricular activities going forward. “As a matter of fact and as a proof of their determination and dedication to the success of our students and Education District 1, the teachers and principals have indicated their readiness to sacrifice the holiday periods to further prepare the students for outstanding performances in all their exams and competitions.” The District’s Director of Co-curricular, Science and Technology Department, Mrs Lucy Omoaka, commended some private organisations that had contributed to the success of the students and teachers through capacity building and exposure to ICT trainings.
