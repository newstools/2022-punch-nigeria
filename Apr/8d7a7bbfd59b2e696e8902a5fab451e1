The Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Reformatory Institutions and member representing Ezza North/Ishielu Federal Constituency, Ebonyi State, Anayo Nwonu, on Sunday called for the release of a Catholic priest, Rev. Fr. Timothy Ngwuta. The PUNCH had reported that Ngwuta has been in prison custody over the protracted communal war between the people of Ezza and Effium, in the Ohaukwu Local Government Area of the state. He was accused of promoting the crisis in the area. The people of Ezza and Effium have been at war for over a year with many lives lost and property worth billions of naira destroyed. Ngwuta was arrested, charged to court and remanded at the Abakaliki Correctional Centre, for over two months. Nwonu, who visited the cleric at the correctional centre, described his detention in prison custody as unjust. He explained that he visited Ngwuta to see what he can do about his release. The governorship aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state, said,  “I  came here on a private visit to see one of us here that is being remanded, I mean Rev. Fr. Ngwuta. I came here to see him and know what we can do about his release. “This is a process that we are undergoing to ensure his freedom. What we are preaching in Ebonyi is that injustice should leave Ebonyi State and that is what we stand for. “I am not a Catholic. I am a pentecostal; but church is church. Our belief is in God and we believe in one God. The most important thing is that an average Ebonyi man is looking for justice.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
