The management of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun state, has extended its mid-semester break by four weeks. On March 26, 2022, the management had announced a two-week break for students beginning from Monday, March 28. But in a release signed by the Registrar of the University and Secretary to the Council, M. Omosule, obtained on Thursday, the management said elongation of the break by four weeks was sequel to the industrial actions embarked upon by various unions. It read in part, “On March 26, the university management announced a two-week mid-semester break for students beginning from Monday, March 28, 2022. “With the full realisation of the import and impact of the industrial actions embarked upon by the various unions within the Nigerian university system, the university management has decided to elongate the mid semester break by four weeks. “Students are therefore directed to continue with the mid-semester break for four weeks, beginning from Monday, April 11, 2022.” Copyright PUNCH.
