Nigeria may not have qualified for the Qatar 2022 World Cup, but the preparations that went into the build-up ahead of the Abuja game has been commended. Ex-international Waidi Akanni, while lamenting Nigeria’s failure to qualify for the World Cup, said the Federal Government deserved a pat on the back for the excellent preparation of the match venue… the Moshood Abiola Stadium. Akanni, the CEO of Match International, noted that the efforts put into the build-up was unprecedented in the country’s history. “Truth be told, I have never seen a situation in which we prepared for a game the way we did against Ghana. What we had could pass as exceptional preparation not seen in recent times. The Federal Government, through the sports ministry, put everything into our preparation to ensure we had a world-class venue. The sports minister Sunday Dare and the Permanent Secretary Ismail Abubakar were on everybody’s neck to ensure that virtually everything needed was in place. “The SA to the President Daniel Amokachi, Mary Onyali, the stadium manager, all the directors in the ministry worked round the clock. They all deserve a pat on the back. It’s unfortunate that on match day proper, our boys failed to come to the party, which saw us failing to pick the World Cup ticket.” Copyright PUNCH.
