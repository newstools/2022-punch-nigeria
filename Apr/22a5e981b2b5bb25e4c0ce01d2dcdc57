Union Berlin striker Taiwo Awoniyi says the family atmosphere at the Bundesliga side helped him settle down quickly. Awoniyi is Union’s record scorer in the German topflight with 13 goals, but the powerful forward has an overall 18 goals in 40 appearances for the Iron Ores this term, after last summer’s move from English giants Liverpool. Awoniyi left Liverpool without making a first-team appearance in six years, largely due to work permit issues. But at Union, he’s been the driving force with his goals contributions, which he attributed to the friendly environment in the German capital. “From the director to the coaches to the players, they’re really friendly guys and friendly people at Union,” Awoniyi told bundesliga.com. “We stay together as a family. I think anyone who comes into this kind of atmosphere will enjoy it. We love doing what he (head coach Urs Fischer) is doing, and that was what integrated me into the team quite early. “For a coach to take you in, sit you down, tell you what he wants, what he expects of you, and joke with you, to work with you, this is what a parent does to their children. Everything he has done is what my father also did to me.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
