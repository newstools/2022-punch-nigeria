The remains of the late veteran Nollywood actor, Chief Lari Williams, will be buried on April 14 in his home town, Yala Nkum in Ikom Local Government Area of Cross River. The first son of the deceased, Femi Williams, disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria on Thursday. The PUNCH had reported that Williams died on February 27, 2022, in his home town after a brief illness, aged 81. He said that a service of songs would be organised for the deceased on April 11 in Lagos and another on April 13 in his hometown, before he would be laid to rest on April 14. Williams said that the family decided to begin the celebration from Lagos, where his father spent most of his life. According to him, the service of songs will take place in Trinity House, Zion Centre, Victoria Island, the church his father attended during his lifetime. “My father impacted the lives of many young artistes through training and mentorship in the profession. “He was quite a determined perfectionist who never compromised the profession, he lived and died loving the theatre instead of financial gains. “My dad was a quite determined man who took interest in training young people, making them repeat their lines over and over again. “Even when he was given short notice to go and perform on stage, he would gather his troupe, train the dancers and make them perform their best,” he told NAN. He noted that late Williams, who was the only son out of three children, was not particular about financial rewards but only wanted to deliver. “He was a great man that spent all his life on stage, acting, singing and dancing. He will be remembered without limit,” he said. (NAN)
