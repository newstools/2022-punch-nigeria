Peoples Democratic Party chieftain, Alhaji Adebisi Olopoeyan, was attacked by hoodlums after joining the New Nigeria People’s Party on Monday in Oyo State. Another governorship aspirant of the PDP, Olukayode Popoola, also dumped the ruling party and joined the NNPP. Speaking while declaring his move to the NNPP in Ibadan on Monday, Olopoeyan said the PDP had become empty and it was wise to leave the party before its collapse. Olopoeyan and other PDP leaders had been at loggerheads with Governor Seyi Makinde and he had said on many occasions that the Governor would be swept out of power in 2023. Olopoeyan said, “This party (NNPP) will shake Oyo state. Many PDP and APC members are coming to join us in NNPP. This is the party that will win elections in Oyo State. “The PDP has become empty in Oyo State and we decided to leave so that it won’t collapse on us. “This party will win the governorship election, senatorial, House of Representatives and House of Assembly in Oyo State because people make political parties strong and we have the people here.” However, a few hours after the declaration, it was gathered that armed hoodlums invaded the residence of Olopoeyan. It was gathered that one person was shot dead during the attack. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Adewale Osifeso, said in a statement that it was a fracas between rival political gangs and not an armed robbery attack. He said the police moved in swiftly and handled the situation. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
