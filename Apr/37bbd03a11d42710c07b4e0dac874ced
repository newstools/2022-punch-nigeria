No fewer than 600 personnel will be deployed by the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Gombe State Command, to provide security across the 11 Local Government Areas of the state. Our correspondent reports that the state has 114 wards and estimated population of about 3.5 million residents, relatively peaceful despite being surrendered by troubled states. However, it has become home for Internally Displaced Persons. In a press statement made available by the Public Relations Officer of the Command, Buhari Saad, the command said that personnel would work before, during and after Easter celebration. The statement partly read, “Commandant of corps CC Baba Goni Waziri has put in place robust security arrangement and crime prevention strategies as directed by the Commandant General CG Ahmed Abubakar Audi to ensure crime free Easter festivities in the State. “He therefore, appeals to members of the general public to be moderate in their celebration saying personnel will display a high sense of vigor and professionalism while discharging their duties.” The command also urged Gombe residents to eschew violence as they rejoice during the Easter, promising that they would work assiduously to provide security to all. “Goni assures members of the public that NSCDC will be polite and civil but firm in ensuring security of lives and properties. Members of the public are to be security conscious and provide useful information to the NSCDC and other security agencies. “The Commandant on behalf of the entire Officers and Men of NSCDC in the State rejoices and facilitates with all Christians as they celebrate the Easter,” the statement added.
