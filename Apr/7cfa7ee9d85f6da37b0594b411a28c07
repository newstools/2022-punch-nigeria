Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, said Senator Iyiola Omisore’s emergence as the National Secretary of the All Progressives Congress would make some politicians quit politics. Oyetola spoke in Osogbo on Thursday at the reception organised for Omisore by the state leadership of the party. He said, “When I was a member of the National Caretaker Committee of the party, some politicians in the state were afraid of my person. Now that Iyiola Omisore has emerged as the party’s National Secretary, some of them will abandon politics. “Osun and Southwest now have a big stake in the party. I now urge you all to start the task of my re-election in earnest, let us work toward getting 450,000 votes to win the governorship landslide.” Speaking earlier, APC National Secretary, Senator Iyiola Omisore, called on members of the party in Osun to appreciate the opportunity given to him to serve at the national level by voting for APC in the forthcoming Osun governorship poll. The ex-Osun state deputy governor, who said the ruling party remained united in the state, promised to sustain the unity being enjoyed in the party. He said, “My emergence as the National Secretary of All Progressives Congress portends greatness, victory for Osun. “You know that Osun is APC state, so we are overwhelmed by this privilege to serve as the National Secretary of APC. I admonish every member of APC and citizen of Osun State to appreciate the party for the privilege given to me by voting massively for Governor Oyetola in July 2022. APC is united in Osun and we will do all our best to sustain this.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
