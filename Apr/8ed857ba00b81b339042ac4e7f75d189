The terrorists that kidnapped passengers of the AK9 Abuja-Kaduna bound train have released the picture of the newly born girl delivered by one of the pregnant women taken hostage. The mother of the baby was said to be eight-month pregnant before she and 62 others were abducted by the terrorists on the Abuja-Kaduna train on March 28, 2022. Of the 63 abducted passengers of the ill-fated train who are still in captivity, only the Managing Director of the Bank of Agriculture, Alwan Hassan, regained his freedom after he was alleged to have paid N100m ransom. Meanwhile, almost one month after the abduction, one of the two pregnant women among those abducted by the terrorists, was delivered of a baby girl. The terrorists believed to be Ansaru, a breakaway of the Boko Haram sect, it was learnt, released the picture of the baby girl on Wednesday night. This came two days after the woman was delivered of the baby girl, according to a family source, who declined to speak to journalists on the matter. But it was gathered that the terrorists brought in their doctors to attend to the pregnant woman to ensure her safe delivery. The picture of the baby girl showed her clad in a thick pink dress and a light lemon sweater cap, with her eyes closed. Another woman who was pregnant and due for Caesarian Session was also among those kidnapped by the bloodthirsty terrorists that struck on March 28, 2022. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
