Nigerian midfielder, Oghenekaro Etebo, is set to return to Championship side Stoke City after the expiration of his season-long loan deal at Premier League strugglers Watford. Etebo’s loan status expires May 31. Since joining Stoke in 2018 on a five-year deal from Portuguese side Feirense, Etebo has failed to hold down a regular shirt at the club, and has been loaned out to Getafe in LaLiga, Turkish giants Galatasaray and Watford. Both Getafe and Galatasaray signed an option to buy the Nigerian at the end of his loan term if his performance was satisfactory but he returned to the Championship side after the end of both loan deals. It is also likely that Watford will not sign him on a permanent basis as they will most likely be playing in the lower league next season and will be hoping to reduce their wage bill. This means the 2016 Olympics bronze medallist might be in search of a new club on his return to Stoke, who will also be looking to cash in on him with an outright sale, with just one year left on his contract. Etebo started the season brightly with the Hornets but suffered a torn thigh muscle, which kept him out of action for over five months. The midfielder is currently valued at €3m, according to football statistics website, Transfermarkt.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
