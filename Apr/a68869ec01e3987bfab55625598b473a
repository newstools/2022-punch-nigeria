The Adavi Police Station in Kogi State has been attacked by suspected hoodlums who shot indiscriminately, killing three officers on duty. According to a statement issued in the early hours of Saturday by the Public Relations Officer, SP William Aya, some hoodlums shot indiscriminately while moving towards the station in the Adavi Local Government Area of the state. He also confirmed that the Quick Response Unit of the command lost three of its officers during the gun duel, as they repelled the attack. He said that the hoodlums fled with gunshot wounds as they could not gain access to the station. “The Commissioner of Police, Kogi Command, Edward Egbuka, immediately deployed a team of tactical operatives to the area, and restored normalcy while trailing the hoodlums to apprehend and bring them to book. “The Commissioner of Police uses this medium to call on the people of Adavi and the adjoining communities to be on the lookout and report anybody seen with bullet wounds to the police, or any other security agent nearest to them. He directs the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Investigation, to commence investigation into the incident,” the statement added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
