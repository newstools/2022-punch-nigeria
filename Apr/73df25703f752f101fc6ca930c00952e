The Nigerian Army has described a viral video where a soldier was crying for help, claiming he had been abandoned by his colleagues during an operation as a deliberate attempt by the soldier to cover up for his act of cowardice. The Army, in a statement by the Director of Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, said preliminary investigation revealed that the soldier had abandoned his colleagues during the clearance operation in Gurara, Niger State. According to him, the act was against the standard of operation of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, adding that the soldier had uploaded the video to whip-up public sentiment and cover up his act of cowardice. The statement read, “Contrary to the claims and impression created by the soldier in the video footage, preliminary investigations have revealed that the video footage was a deliberate attempt to shield himself from being accused of cowardice, having abandoned his colleagues during an ongoing clearance operation in Gurara, Niger State.”  Copyright PUNCH.
