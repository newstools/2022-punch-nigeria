Super Eagles duo Samuel Kalu and William Troost-Ekong have both been ruled out of Watford’s clash against Brentford at the Vicarage Road on Saturday (today), PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Watford’s hopes of winning their battle against relegation suffered a further blow as Hornets coach Watford coach, Roy Hodgson, confirmed that forward Cucho Hernandez sustained a hamstring injury that may well have ended his season. Speaking ahead of the clash, the former England coach revealed that Kalu copped an ankle injury while Troost-Ekong is suffering from a slight hamstring strain. “We’ve got one or two minor ones,” Hodgson said in his pre-match conference on Friday. “But I mean not from the ones who have been playing regularly. So, Samuel Kalu, who was with us last time, has got an ankle injury. “Willy Ekong is suffering from a slight hamstring strain. We don’t think it’s major but too early to risk him in this game. “Francisco Sierralta, the same thing, has a calf muscle injury which has stopped him training this week but I don’t think it’s going to put him out for a long period of time. “It’s put those four players out of contention if you like for a place this weekend. But the one, of course, whose name will be on people’s lips is Hernandez because he’s been playing the last few games and scored some goals. I don’t know anything about that. It’s not going to affect my preparation for the game anyway. Kalu has made two substitute appearances – against Arsenal and Wolverhampton Wanderers since he arrived from Ligue 1 club, Bordeaux. Both games ended in defeats. Troost-Ekong on his part has made 16 Premier League appearances with his last appearance for the club against Tottenham Hotspur on January 1.  Copyright PUNCH.
