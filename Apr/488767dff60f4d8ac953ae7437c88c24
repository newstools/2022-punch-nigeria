According to Fotospor, Trabzonspor have identified Nigerian international Henry Onyekuru as a possible replacement for compatriot Anthony Nwakaeme, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Nwakaeme has been tipped for a possible exit from Trabzonspor with a move to Fernabache on the card after turning down the club’s offer over a disagreement on financial details. The 32-year-old has been one of the club’s best players since joining the side in the 2019/19 season from Israeli side Hapoel Be’er Sheva scoring 44 goals while providing 40 assists in 141 appearances for the club. He has also found the back of the net 12 times while providing 11 assists in 32 games across all competitions this season and he is one of the reasons the Black Sea Storm, as they are fondly called, are cruising to their first league title in nearly 40 years. Though the Turkish giants are open to returning to the negotiation table with Nwakaeme who has become a cult hero at the club, they already have their eyes on Onyekuru should they lose their key man on a free transfer. Onyekuru is currently valued at €7m and has a contract with Olympiacos until June 30, 2025. “In Trabzonspor, the button was pressed for the transfer of Henry Onyekuru in case Nwakaeme goes to Fenerbahce,” the Turkish website wrote. A deal for Onyekuru could see the 24-year-old make a return to Turkey after three loan spells with Galatasaray. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
