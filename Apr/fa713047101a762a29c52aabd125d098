A non-governmental organisation, Foundation for Disability Issues, has called on the Federal Government to make Nigeria safe for all by tacking insecurity. The coordinator of FDI, Mr Kehinde Oshilaja, according to a statement on Tuesday, made this call during an annual get-together for people living with disabilities in Ebute-Metta. He said, “We want the Federal Government, especially President Muhammadu Buhari, to as a matter of urgency, put a permanent end to the increasing security challenges being witnessed across the country and make the country safe for all and sundry without delay. “I can tell you that we people living with disabilities, especially the blind, which I am one of them, deaf, dumb and those with leg deformities feel it the more. Our President should please rescue this country from imminent collapse and ugly situation. Please do it without delay.” A Pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Good Shepherd Parish, Alagomeji, Adedoyin Ajibodu, who was represented by Pastor Wilson Rotimi, said, “I want to enjoin good-spirited Nigerians to accord due respect to people living with disabilities and stop treating them as second class citizens, because servants and real baby were born the same way and the government at all levels should also intensify efforts at making life more worth living for them in all ramifications.” Copyright PUNCH.
