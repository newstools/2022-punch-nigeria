Event planner, Sunmbo Adeoye, on Friday celebrated the 14th birthday of her son, Zion, whom she had with Nigerian singer, Innocent ‘2Baba’ Idibia. On her Instagram page, the excited mum shared pictures of her teenage son, accompanied by a heartfelt message. Sunmbo, who is now married to a pastor, noted that she felt blessed to have Zion as her son, as she always showered prayers on him. She wrote, “Birthday Boy. Happy birthday my own King Zii, chief executive assistant extraordinary “The master minder of every good and pleasant surprises for me. I feel truly blessed to have you and I pray that God will continue to bless and keep you through life’s journey. “Mummy is super excited for all the future holds for you son. May your name be exceedingly great in Jesus’ matchless name. Amen. I love you.” Our correspondent observed that 2Baba’s wife, Annie Idibia, liked the Instagram birthday post. As at the time of filing this report, 2Baba has not celebrated his son’s birthday on his social media pages. This comes two days after the singer celebrated the 16th birthday of one of his children, Ehikòwoichó, who he welcomed with his other baby mama, Pero Adeniyi. 2Baba and Pero have three children together, while the singer has two children each with his wife, Annie, and Sunmbo. Annie recently lamented that though she knew 2Baba first, her first child was the singer’s fifth. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
