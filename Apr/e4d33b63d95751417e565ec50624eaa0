Nigeria’s Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo met with the country’s president, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in Aso Rock on Tuesday. The meeting came eight days after Osinbajo officially declared his intention to contest the 2023 presidential election. Details of the meeting are sketchy as of the time of filing this report. Osinbajo, who turned 65 last month, is a senior advocate of Nigeria and a former lecturer at the University of Lagos. He is also a senior pastor with the Redeemed Christian Church of God. He was nominated as Buhari’s running mate in 2014 and was elected alongside Buhari in 2015. During his seven-year tenure as Vice-President, Osinbajo served as acting President for more than 120 non-consecutive days while his principal was on medical leave in London between 2016 and 2018 Osinbajo will be contesting the APC Presidential primary against Bola Tinubu; the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi; and Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State. Others in the APC who are rumoured to be nursing Presidential ambitions include Ekiti State Governor and Chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum, Kayode Fayemi; the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige. The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, is also considered a contender. SEE PHOTOS:   Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
