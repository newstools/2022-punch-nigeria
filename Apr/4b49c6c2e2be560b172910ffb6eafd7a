A university dropout, Mustapha Gajibo, takes us on a journey into his world of self-made electric vehicles and some of the challenges he faces. Gajibo said some of the problems he wanted to solve were problems of carbon monoxide in the environment, high cost of transportation and others. He also said he had to explore ways to produce energy because of the situation of power supply in the country. According to Gajibo, he uses solar panels to power the vehicles and the first prototype was done in two years. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
