ABEOKUTA and other Ogun communities have been plunged into darkness following the collapse of three power towers. The Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company said three towers on the Papalanto/Ojere 132KV double-circuit lines collapsed, leaving the state capital, Ayetoro, Imeko, Owode Egba and Mowe with no power supply for days. The IBEDC in a statement signed by its management on Wednesday, said the collapse of the towers adversely affected Abeokuta Transmission Sub-station, Ojere and New Abeokuta Transmission station at Kobape. According to the statement shared on its social media handle, it was stated that all the 33KV feeders from the affected sub-stations would be out until the towers were reconstructed. IBEDC which did not give  specific time for the reconstruction, said  residents of the entire Abeokuta metropolis, Ayetoro, Imeko Mowe and Owode Egba would continue to experience power outage. The distribution company, however,  apologised to its consumers for the inconvenience, assuring them that power would be restored as soon as the towers were fixed. The statement read in part, “Dear esteemed customer, kindly be informed of the collapse of three towers on the Papalanto/Ojere 132KV double-circuit lines. The incident adversely affected Abeokuta Transmission Sub-station, Ojere and New Abeokuta T/S at Kobape. “All 33KV feeders from these two sub-stations will be out until the towers are reconstructed. As such, the entire city of Abeokuta and environs, Ayetoro, Imeko, Owode Egba and Mowe will be experiencing power outages. “Power supply will be restored to the affected communities as soon as the towers are reconstructed.
