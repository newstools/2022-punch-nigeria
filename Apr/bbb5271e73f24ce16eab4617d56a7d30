A new study has revealed that nearly 180,000 avoidable deaths over 14 years in fast-growing tropical cities were caused by a rapid rise in emerging air pollution. The report, published Friday, April 8, 2022, in Science Advances by the University College London, identifies rapid degradation in air quality and increases in urban exposure to air pollutants, as corridors of health hazards. The researchers attributed this rapid degradation in air quality to emerging industries and residential sources like road traffic, waste burning, and widespread use of charcoal and fuelwood. The tropical cities analysed in this study spread across Africa, South Asia, South-East Asia, and the Middle East. They included: The PUNCH reports that this study is complementary to the latest report released by the World Health Organisation on Monday, April 4, 2022 – ahead of the recently concluded World Health Day. The PUNCH had reported that a staggering 99 per cent of the global population breathed air exceeding the prescribed quality limits, thereby posing serious health dangers. According to the WHO’s analysis of over 6,000 cities in 117 countries where it had monitored their air qualities, the inhabitants of these cities were yet unawarely breathing unhealthy levels of fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide, adding that people in low and middle-income countries were even more susceptible to the highest level of exposure. ”After surviving a pandemic, it is unacceptable to still have seven million preventable deaths and countless preventable lost years of good health due to air pollution. ”That’s what we’re saying when we look at the mountain of air pollution data, evidence, and solutions available. Yet too many investments are still being sunk into a polluted environment rather than in clean, healthy air,” WHO Director, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health, Dr Maria Neira, stated in the report earlier this week.
