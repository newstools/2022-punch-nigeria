There was panic in Owerri, Imo State on Monday evening as suspected hoodlums took over the streets and were shooting. The shooting brought all commercial and social activities in the affected areas to an end. The shooting, which started around 4.30 pm, saw residents and visitors scampering for safety. Our correspondent, who was caught in the web of the confusion at the Okigwe Road, saw commercial motorists and private vehicle owners making emergency U- turns. The situation in Owerri was calm until some gunmen started shooting, sending residents scampering for safety. Officers guarding the Owerri Custodial Centre responded by barricading the centre to avoid incursion by the gunmen. The situation forced motorists entering the city centre from Okigwe to stop at Orji until the situation was normalised. A bus loaded with passengers tumbled as it hit the road kerb while trying to make a hurried u-turn at Orji on the Owerri- Okigwe Road. About five persons were injured and were rushed to nearby clinics for first aid. The spokesman for the state police command, Michael Abatham, had yet to respond to an inquiry concerning the development. Meanwhile, Anambra State on Monday witnessed improved commercial activities and movements since the Monday sit-at-home order began in the state. While banks, petrol stations, motor parks and some offices remained shut, there were increased vehicular movements and skeletal activities at some market places. One of our correspondents, who visited major cities of the state such as Onitsha, Nnewi, Oba, Obosi and Awka, observed that the areas were without the usual tension that characterised the exercise.
