The Special Adviser to the Osun State Governor on Civic Engagement, Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, has said that Governor Adegboyega Oyetola is not feeling tensed ahead of the July 16 governorship poll. He said there was no tension because the masses were in support of Oyetola’s re-election. Oyintiloye spoke at a civic engagement meeting organised by the state’s Civic Engagement Office with the Association of Master Bakers, Osun Chapter in Osogbo on Sunday. A statement by Oyintiloye, who represented Oyetola at the meeting titled ‘I will be re-elected because I have kept promises made to Osun people, says Oyetola,’ obtained in Osogbo on Sunday, further said the government had kept all promises made to the people of the state before he was elected in 2018. He said the government would continue to focus on quality service delivery to the people if re-elected. He added that Oyetola would not relax but work harder for better living conditions. “Because the masses are behind him, Governor Oyetola is approaching the poll with no tension, and they will return him to office. “He has kept promises made to the good people of Osun, and I know that they will keep their promise to return him on the election date. “He will not in any way relax in his second term in office, but he will rather continue to build on the solid foundation he has laid,” he said. Appealing to members of the association to collect their Permanent Voter Cards, Oyintiloye also urged them to support Oyetola’s reelection. In his remarks, the chairman of the association, Bakare Ganiyu, commended the governor for various developmental projects in the state and promised that his members would support Oyetola’s re-election bid.
