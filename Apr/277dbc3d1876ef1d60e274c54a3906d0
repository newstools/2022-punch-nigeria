Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, has revealed why he ran round the Port Harcourt stadium in Rivers State during his official declaration as a presidential aspirant for 2023 elections. The former Rivers State Governor opened up in Ile-Ife, Osun state, during a visit to the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, as part of consultation on his 2023 presidential ambition. Amaechi noted that he ran round the stadium to check how fit he was to “carry the problems of the country”, Daily Post reported. “Age will not be an issue. I am like a bridge between the young and the old,” Amaechi said. He added, “People have asked me why I ran round the stadium. I was checking to see how fit I am, so I had to run round the stadium to confirm to myself that I’m strong enough to carry the problems of the country, whether it is mentally or physically. “Because you need both mental capacity and physical fitness to manage this country. “You have to be physically strong and have the mental capacity to make decisions on behalf of the country.” Amaechi also stated that he was the most qualified to succeed the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in 2023. In his response, Oba Ogunwusi said to Amaechi, “You have been relevant since the start of this republic, it is for a reason and I urge you to use that grace for the betterment of all Nigerians.” Amaechi had on April 9 declared his interest to run for Presidency at a thanksgiving service organised by the Rivers State chapter of the All Progressives Congress.
