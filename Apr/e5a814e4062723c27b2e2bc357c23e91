Former Senate President and presidential aspirant, Bukola Saraki, has explained why the All Progressives Congress-led Federal Government couldn’t remove him from office. He gave the reasons on Tuesday at the Transcorp Hotel Calabar, while seeking votes from the Peoples Democratic Party delegates ahead of the party’s presidential primary. Saraki said, “I held people together to an extent that it was difficult for those who were against me to throw me out of office. “I related very well with my people. I am talking about everyone that mattered at the Senate. “I held people together. We need a President who can afford to hold everyone together. I am someone who, if you give me an office, I will leave the office better than when I met it.” He said that for anyone to succeed as President of Nigeria today, the fellow must have the passion, vision and the brain to create wealth. “To create wealth, you must have the knowledge, certificate for skill acquisition and entrepreneurship. “We must include the youths in our government. The youths must become ministers in my administration,” he said. Saraki, who was governor of Kwara State, promised to create jobs to fight the unemployment situation in the country. “I seek your support. The promise I make today shall be fulfilled. Give me the opportunity, my team and I shall make this country great once again,” he told the delegates. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
