Nigeria’s Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development, Pauline Tallen, has said she will initiate a conversation with her counterpart at the Ministry of Interior for the adoption of a compulsory psychiatric test as a pre-requirement for marriages in the country. Tallen, who lamented the rising cases of gender-based violence in marriages, said such tests would help eradicate the scourge. She spoke while addressing journalists in Abuja on Friday. Tallen said, “I am deeply concerned; families are crying and losing loved ones to one form of brutality or another. The Media headlines are heart-breaking. Society is devastated. “Oh God, heal our land! Help our children to appreciate humanity and make the society whole again. The alarming increase in Gender-Based Violence as witnessed in the last few weeks truly calls for concern and urgent action. “As we are dealing with the case of Osinachi Nwachukwu as one-more-case-too-many of GBV, we were again greeted this time with so many others. “As a first step to ensuring that we bring an end to this issue, I will initiate a conversation with the Minister of Interior to ensure that psychiatric tests are made compulsory as part of marriage requirements in the country. “The families make up the society and everyone comes from a family. Mothers are the bedrock of the family and custodians of family traditions.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
