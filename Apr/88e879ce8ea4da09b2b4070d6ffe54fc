Nigerian basketballer and Brigham Young University forward, Gideon George, has declared for the 2022 NBA Draft. George, who averaged 8.8 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 1.2 assists per game, primarily as a small forward for the Cougars in 27 games the past two seasons took to social media to declare his intention on Friday. “First I want to thank God for all that he has given me in my life, I want to thank Coach Pope and the incredible staff at BYU and all of Cougar Nation for the love and support over the past two years. Finally, I want to thank the friends and family that have loved and guided me through this journey so far. “Today (Friday), I am taking the next step towards realising my dream, and will be declaring for the NBA Draft. Throughout this process I will be maintaining my college eligibility. I look forward with open eyes and an open heart for what God has in store for me next. I love you all.” Last year, George and Warith Alatishe were hailed by D’Tigers coach Mike Brown as proto-typical NBA wings after identifying them as future prospects for the national team. “They’re long, they’re energetic and athletic, they do a lot for you on both ends of the court and their ability to go to the rim and finish over the defence is second to none especially for young men their age.” The 6ft 6in, 210-pound prospect shot 43.6 per cent from the field and 34.9 per cent from three-point range this past season. The deadline for early NBA draft entrants to withdraw is June 13.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
