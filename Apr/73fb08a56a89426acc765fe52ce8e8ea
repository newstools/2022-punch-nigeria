Bauchi State Governor and presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, Bala Mohammed, on Wednesday, in Abuja, dared the anti-graft agencies to probe him, assuring that they would find nothing indicting. He also noted that he would not be a northern president, but one who captures the nuanced aspirations of every part of the country. Mohammed said this when he consulted with the PDP National Working Committee at Wadata Plaza, Abuja. The former FCT minister, who is seeking the support of the committee to emerge as the party’s presidential flagbearer, expressed the belief that the party would pick the most suitable of the 17 presidential aspirants who have so far obtained their nomination and expression of interest forms. He stated,  “I don’t bear any malice against anybody who investigated me. But I dare anybody to find me guilty because I know my conscience and that’s why I’m still standing here. I dare every investigative agency; I did my best.” Citing his past three years in office as governor, Mohammed argued that states did not have to be rich before providing infrastructure for their people. He also noted that he would not be a partisan president only reflecting the desires of the North but all Nigerians who, he said, need good governance, justice and equity.  Copyright PUNCH.
