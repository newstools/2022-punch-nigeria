The acting Force Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, has said that the Nigerian Police Force will begin eliminating cases of police extortion by holding Divisional Police Officers and Commanders responsible for the actions of officers in their units. The move, he said, was part of measures being put in place by the force to protect Nigerians and eradicate cases of extortion and harassment of citizens by the police. Announcing the new measure on his Twitter page on Friday, Adejobi noted that the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba-led NPF would work assiduously in repositioning the police force and gain the trust of Nigerians. He assured that through the new intervention, the police would be able to bridge the noticeable leadership gap in the force and restore sanity to the force’s operations. The tweet read, “In a bid to reduce or possibly put a stop to extortion, harassment, and brutality in the NPF, we will henceforth hold DPOs and Commanders responsible for the misdeeds of their men. “In as much as we don’t promote vicarious liability, we have equally noticed that some superiors fail or lack the willingness and/or wherewithal to supervise and manage their men. “This leadership gap is not in tune with the leadership styles of the IGP and his repositioning drives, thus, counterproductive and condemnable.” The PUNCH reports that cases of police extortion, harassment, and extra-judicial killings led to the nationwide protest against police brutality in October 2020.
