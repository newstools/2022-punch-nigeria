Belgian club Club Brugge are in line to receive €1m as part of their sale of Nigeria international Emmanuel Dennis to Watford, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The two clubs agreed on a deal for the Super Eagles forward in the summer of 2021, with Brugge accepting a €4m plus add-ons transfer. A series of confrontations between the Nigerian and the Belgian club led to his forceful exit to Watford for just €4m, a fee far less than his perceived valuation. The 24-year-old joined up with The Hornets following their promotion to the English Premier League and has been impressive in his debut season in the topflight league. Despite Watford’s struggles, Dennis has been outstanding and has been involved in 16 goals – 10 goals and six assists. Following another defeat to Manchester City on Saturday, Watford’s chances of surviving the drop look slim, with just five matches to the end of the 2021/22 season, occupying the 19th position with 22 points, eight points behind Everton who sit 18 on the log. Dennis’s performance has not gone unnoticed and he has caught the attention of several clubs with Leeds United reportedly interested in the striker. If Watford drop to the Championship, they may be forced to sell one of their most prized assets, who has been tipped to leave for a fee in the region of €20m to €30m. However, The Athletic wrote that according to a senior official at the Belgian club, there is a sell-on percentage believed to be about five per cent inserted in the deal that took Dennis to Watford. Should the striker choose to leave, Brugge could make as much as €1m from the sale of the Nigerian striker.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
