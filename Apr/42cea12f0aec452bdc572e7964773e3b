Minister of Transportation and presidential aspirant under the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Rotimi Amaechi, has said that he is experienced in governance and forthright to be the next president of the country. Amaechi said he would rule the country with his wealth of experience when elected as president. The minister spoke on Monday at the presidential lodge in Abeokuta while addressing APC leaders and members in the state led by the state Governor Dapo Abiodun. He said “Let me thank you for the opportunity you gave me to address you, I know that there is a candidate from this state, our vice president, the man of honour, he is a good candidate but, I think that if you look well, my experience matters. He, the Vice President, has said that I am a forthright man with his mouth and if you approach me you will know I am forthright.” The Minister noted that his administration would also favour women by appointing them to positions in the country. “Women will be given the same opportunity as men, it is not about giving women special opportunity. Women are by far more brilliant than men, you know that – it is scientific. If you have two children, a male and a female, the male will be failing exams and the female will be passing but it is at the later stage that the man will take over. “The woman will serve well but the man will take over. I think what will happen is that we will give women equal opportunity as the men, you will compete equally, you will be appointed on merit and you will be given that chance to be part of the government.” Copyright PUNCH.
