THE Lagos Environmental Sanitation Corps has warned street traders against hawking their wares on pedestrian bridges, road setbacks and verges as this blocks human and vehicular movements. The agency’s Corps Marshal, Gbemisola Akinpelu, gave the warning in a statement on Sunday, adding that it is essential for Lagos residents to keep their surroundings clean as more waste will be generated during the Easter festivities. She said, “We want to warn street traders and hawkers displaying their wares for sale on pedestrian bridges, road setbacks, lay-bys, medians and verges to desist from the illegal act as it contravenes the state Environmental Management Protection Law of 2017 and it impedes free vehicular as well as pedestrian movement. “There is the need for pedestrians to resort to the use of strategically-erected pedestrian bridges on highways across the state to avoid accidents because their safety is of high priority to the Lagos State Government. “I also want to warn against the menace of commercial motorcyclists, dispatch riders and uniformed men using the wheelchair ramps of pedestrian bridges to cross to the other side of the road; these culprits should desist from such practices as the ramps are meant for people living with disabilities.” Akinpelu also warned residents against emptying wastes into drainages as those found culpable would be dealt with by the law. “The unhygienic behaviour of residents who channel their waste into gutters, as well as those who refuse to empty their overflowing septic tanks, is lamentable and we want to warn these residents involved in such environmental infractions across the state that they will soon be dealt with by the law,” she added.
