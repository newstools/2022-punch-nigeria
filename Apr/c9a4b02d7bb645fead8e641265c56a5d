The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has joined Nigerians to mourn the demise of Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III. In a statement issued by his special adviser on media and publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, on Saturday, Buhari said Alaafin was significant for human development, adding that he encouraged learning as a culture and formal education and promoted values of peace and stability. The statement read, “President Muhammadu Buhari condoles with the Government and people of Oyo State over the passing of Alaafin of Oyo, Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III, 83, whose reign covered major historic transitions in the country, and witnessed transformations in his domain. “The President affirms that the Alaafin of Oyo’s 52 years of rule was remarkable in many ways, most significant was the emphasis he placed on human development, thereby encouraging learning as a culture and formal education as a necessity while promoting values of peace and stability. “As a highly revered traditional ruler, President Buhari notes the late monarch’s numerous participations in national meetings and conferences to shape the future of the country, and the living words of wisdom he shared at every opportunity on unity and people-focused governance. “The President shares the grief with the Oyo State Traditional Council, Oba Lamidi’s family, friends, and associates, particularly in sports where he left another footprint.” Buhari prayed that the Almighty God would receive his soul.
