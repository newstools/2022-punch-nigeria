The traditional ruler of Ogidi in the Idemili North Local Government Area of Anambra State, Igwe Alex Onyido, has decried the growing rate of cultism and other social vices among youths in the South East region. Onyido spoke on Monday during the celebration of the second Ito-Aro in Ogidi, Anambra State. The monarch frowned on the increasing rate of insecurity in the South-East and challenged the youths to resist the mentality of sitting at home and folding their hands as such leads to crime. He said crimes such as robbery, cultism, and internet fraud among the youths were a result of laziness, adding that such vices lead to avoidable violent crime and an unfortunate end. Onyido decried the senseless killings in the region, saying that the scale and frequency of unwarranted killings were unprecedented. He urged the perpetrators to drop the practice and have a change of heart as well as take a step to atone for their sins. “Those who want to have a change of heart from committing crime should come out and extricate themselves and avoid the consequences. “Our young ones should endeavour to be job creators, only lazy people complain of joblessness,” he added Earlier in his speech, the chairman of the occasion, Prof. Frank Okafor, urged members of the community to join hands to work for the progress of the community and Anambra State in general.
