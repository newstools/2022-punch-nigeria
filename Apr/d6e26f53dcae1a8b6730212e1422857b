The leadership of Osinbajo Youth Organisation has urged Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, to continue praying for the presidential ambition of Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo. This was disclosed by the leader of the group, Tukura Kwayi, during a visit to Oba Ogunwusi in his palace in Ile-Ife. A statement by Kwayi on Saturday obtained in Osogbo said the group was in Ife to seek God’s intervention for Osinbajo’s bid to ascend the nation’s presidency. The statement read in parts, “I am here to call on the earpiece of the gods because this is the time that we need the gods to step in. They say God is the one that gives power. “So, we have come here to beg on behalf of the Vice President that his Royal Majesty, the Ooni of Ife pray for him and also support his candidacy to become the next President of Nigeria in 2023.” Responding, Oba Ogunwusi, acknowledged Osinbajo’s passion for the youth, saying, “It is God that gives powers and this throne is very sacred in Yoruba land and all I want to do for his Excellency, the Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, is to pray for him.
