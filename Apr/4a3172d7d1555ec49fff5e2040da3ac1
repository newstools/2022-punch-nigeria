An entertainment entrepreneur and talent manager, Abiodun Alabi, is of the opinion that lack of transparency is affecting the entertainment industry. He told Saturday Beats, “To be an entrepreneur, one must be ready to tackle challenges. It also means one is a problem solver. Knowing what is ahead is half the battle. One of the problems (I face as an entertainment entrepreneur) is lack of transparency. This has been an issue for as long as I can remember. There are issues with the complex nature of contracts, advertising, handling and settlement of funds, acquisition and retaining of personnel and content.” Abiodun, who is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of several companies, including Toff G Entertainment, Headie Global Residence, My Visa Advisor and Toff Homes, also noted that he is constantly on the lookout for talents. He said, “It is my job to find the right person who will produce consistent results. Also, I understand the difference between ‘goldbricking’ and those with raw talents that can be polished. Over the years, I have successfully managed talents such as   Lilhezx, Grozny and Juwilz.” Speaking on how he manages all his business, he said, “I would not say it has been easy but God has been helping me. In a way, entertainment and real estate actually go hand-in-hand because one can create content for real estate marketing such as optimising websites. My entertainment business does not actually affect involvement in real estate.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
