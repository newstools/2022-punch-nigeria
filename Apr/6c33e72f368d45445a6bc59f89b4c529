An actor and entertainment entrepreneur, Henry Agbai, says he yearns for a time when there will no longer be low-budget movies in Nollywood. In an interview with Saturday Beats, he said, “One of the things that break my heart is seeing actors or filmmakers not being able to sell movies on a bigger scale. I would love to see a time when that would take place, both locally and intentionally. I also want a total end to piracy by films going strictly on streaming sites. Lastly, I think we should stop low-budget productions.” Agbai, who is the Chief Executive Officer of Titan Studio Channel, also stated that he decided to set up a new studio  because of his passion for quality productions. He said, “I decided to open a new studio because of the passion and love I have for acting. I want to bring a change to Nollywood through the production of quality movies and TV series. Also, I studied Theatre Arts in school. “I know there are a lot of studios out there but we aim to be different by making sure we are consistently innovative, and infusing a whole lot into our production.” Sharing his thoughts on the quality of movies churned out in Nollywood, Agbai said, “I think movies that make it to the cinemas and Netflix are really great. But, there are low-budget movies that make Nollywood practitioners look like amateurs. I can’t wait for a time when we would all get it right in production.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
