Nollywood actress Ada Karl has called out her colleague, Tonto Dikeh over unpaid debts from 15 years ago. Karl took to Instagram to berate Dikeh for gifting diamonds to her former boyfriend despite owing her for several years. She also claimed that she had sponsored Dikeh’s entry into the film industry, but had received no return on her investment. “Tonto you dey buy diamonds for man but you have no conscience to pay what you owe me over 15 years ago,” she wrote. “I’m not talking of the millions I pumped into your career after I brought you into Nollywood, and gave you your first ever movie role, and sponsored you with my last sweat, till you had your breakthrough and vanished from my life (what a user. I should have signed a contract). “I am talking about the shoes, clothes, and gold that you bought from me. That money was N80k, in today’s money it’s equivalent to N8m, any day I see you for road, I must collect my money.” Karl’s allegations come amid Dikeh’s rekindled Instagram war with ex-lover, Joseph Egbiri alias Prince Kpokpogri. In an Instagram post on Monday, Dikeh demanded that Kpokpogri return items she had gifted him during their romance. “Anywhere I see you wearing the Hermes slippers I bought for you, you are going home barefoot. “In order for you to maintain peace this 2022, return my diamond and other things the police couldn’t retrieve from you because I have no proof to claim,” she wrote.
