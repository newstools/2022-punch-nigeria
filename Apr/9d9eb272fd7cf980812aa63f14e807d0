The All Progressives Grand Alliance has insisted that the Governor of Anambra State, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, is not fighting the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, but collaborating with the group and security agencies to eradicate all forms of criminality in the state. The National Coordinator, APGA Media Warriors Forum, Chinedu Obigwe, told journalists in Awka, the state capital, on Saturday that criminals in the state were only dwelling in self deceit with their hit and run tactics. He noted that the governor could not be frightened by their “cowardice attacks”. He added, “Those behind the insecurity in Anambra State are not freedom fighters because freedom fighters don’t indulge in the suppression and oppression of those they are fighting for their freedom. Ndi Anambra should understand that Soludo is fighting for their liberation from the hands of wicked criminals.” Obigwe noted that security of lives and properties was the bedrock of sustainable development, which was why the governor was determined to nip insecurity in the bud.
