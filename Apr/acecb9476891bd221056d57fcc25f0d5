A support group, Asiwaju Project Beyond 2023, has expressed its readiness to purchase the presidential nomination form for an All Progressives Congress aspirant, Bola Tinubu. In a statement released in Abuja by its National Director, Media & Publicity, Adeboye Adebayo, on Wednesday night, the group said picking up the form for him was a result of the belief they had in him and to make it clear to Nigerians that he had the capacity to lead Nigeria to the promised land.
