Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie, on Thursday hailed himself as a “real” man, following the announcement of his second marriage. Edochie, sharing a picture of himself on his Instagram page, noted that real men own up and take responsibility. Hailing himself, the actor wrote in Pidgin, “Na man you be.” The photo caption read, “Real men own up and take responsibility. Fake men dey hide for back dey run am. EZEDIKE! Na man you be.” The actor caused a stir on social media on Wednesday, after he made his second marriage public, adding that his new wife already had a son for him. Edochie’s first wife of 17 years, May, has since unfollowed her husband on Instagram amid the news of his second marriage to Nollywood actress, Judy Austin. Reacting to the news of the marriage, the mother-of-four called down the judgement of God on the latest couple. Taking to the comment section of her husband’s announcement post, she wrote, “May God judge you both.” However, Yul had on Thursday morning hailed May in an Instagram post, where he said she was his undisputed “number one”. Yul, the last child of veteran actor, Pete Edochie, married his first wife at the young age of 22, and they have four kids together. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
