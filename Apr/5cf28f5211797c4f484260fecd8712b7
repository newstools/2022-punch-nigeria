Gospel singer and music entrepreneur, Yinka Ayefele, says he no longer finds it challenging being a father of triplets, unlike what obtained when they were born. Recall that the singer welcomed a set of triplets in 2019 after many years of waiting. He told Saturday Beats, “It was challenging then because I did not have the experience prior to that time. There is nothing so serious about having triplets. They are fun to be with and I have been enjoying them. Even if they are four or five, I think I can cope with them. It is not challenging anymore.” On how he felt after his radio station, Fresh FM in Ibadan, was attacked by armed robbers recently, he said, “I don’t want to talk about it. It is not something that is worth celebrating or talking about. I just want the police to continue with their investigations and get to the root of it. The bottom line is to thank God we did not have any casualties.” Speaking about his expansion plans for his radio stations, Ayefele said, “I don’t have any musical projects presently. I am only working on the videos for some of the songs off my last album. Besides, I am occupied with working on my radio stations in Lagos and Akure (Ondo State). I have also just started Urban FM in Ibadan. “It is all about providing a means of employment for youths. That is why I expanded it to Akure, Ado Ekiti, Osogbo, and Ogun states.”  Copyright PUNCH.
