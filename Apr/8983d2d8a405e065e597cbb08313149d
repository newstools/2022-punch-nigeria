Adamawa State local government council elections which held on Saturday across 21 council areas of the state were marred by voter apathy and delays. But the opposition All Progressive Congress, speaking shortly after the close of polls, called for the cancellation of the polls after it condemned the exercise. The party said the exercise failed to meet the minimum standard for free, fair and credible polls in a democracy. Isa Shettima, Chairman Adamawa State Independent Electoral Commission, who spoke with journalists after monitoring the polls, blamed the delays on the observance of Ramadan fast. Though the ADSIEC chairman admitted delays in the start of voting across most polling units, he noted that the challenge could not have been due to shortage of ad hoc personnel. He stated that the commission engaged 13,000 ad hoc staff for the polls. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
