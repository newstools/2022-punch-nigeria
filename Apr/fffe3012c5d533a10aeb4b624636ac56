Union Berlin striker Taiwo Awoniyi will be looking to score his third goal against Hertha Berlin when both sides clash on Saturday in the Berlin derby at the Olympiastadion in front of over 74,000 spectators. It will be the third time the Nigeria international will be facing the Berlin-based team in the German topflight league.. The 24-year-old will however be banking on getting on the score sheet again, having grabbed goals in his last two meetings with the latest coming in a 2-0 derby win in November where he (Awoniyi) scored the opener before Christopher Trimmel added the second. Awoniyi has returned to form, scoring three goals in Union’s last five outings thereby becoming the club’s record Bundesliga scorer with 17 goals, including a career-best 12 this season. A win for Union will see them continue their fight for a European football slot at the end of the season. They are currently three points behind sixth placed Hoffenhiem. Head coach of the team Urs Fischer has called on his players to bring in the same intensity they had against Cologne where Awoniyi grabbed the only goal in the memorable win. “We need to bring the intensity again, it’s the basics, it’s our style. We talked about it today: to give everything for the last six games plus the cup. That mentality is required like against Cologne.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
