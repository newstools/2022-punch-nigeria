A former federal lawmaker, Shehu Sani, Sunday, urged political appointees and others planning to resign from their position in line with the Electoral Act 2022 and contest for elective offices to think well before handing over their resignation letters. Those affected by section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 are ministers, commissioners, and aides to governors among other political appointees. The section states as follows: “No political appointed at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.” In accordance with the section, some governors had issued circulars calling on their appointees who had political ambitions to resign before March 30. But reacting to the recent provision of the Electoral Act in a tweet on his Twitter handle on Sunday, Sani who represented Kaduna Central in the 8th Senate, warned appointees seeking political offices to rethink their position. He tweeted, “Before you resign from your appointment or position to jump into the murky, treacherous & shark-infested waters of politics & contest elections, think twice & look left, right & deeper. And know that you are leaving what you have for what you are not sure at where you don’t know.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
