Barely 16 hours after the death of billionaire owner of Tahir Guest Palace, Alhaji Fadlallah Tahir in Lebanon, Kano State Deputy Governor, Dr Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna, on Friday commiserated with the immediate family members and the Lebanese community in the country, over the passing away of their son. In a statement made by his Chief Press Secretary to the Deputy Governor, Hassan Musa Fagge, Gawuna said, “He will be greatly missed. I therefore on behalf of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, the government and people of Kano State extend our heartfelt condolences to the deceased’s family and his friends.” He prayed to the Almighty Allah to bless the soul of the deceased and reward him with paradise. Tahir died in Lebanon in the early hours of Friday, just as his remains were expected from Lebanon for burial at the Lebanese burial ground, Hajj camp, Kano. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
