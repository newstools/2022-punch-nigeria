Crisis erupted on Tuesday evening between members of two factions of the National Union of Road Transport Workers in Akure, Ondo State, leaving many injured. The state government had suspended the activities of the NURTW in the state while a 21-man Motor Parks Management Committee led by the former state chairman of the union, Jacob Adebo, was set up. It was gathered that the faction opposing Adebo’s appointment clashed with his supporters at some of the parks in the state capital, causing panic in the town while residents ran helter-skelter for their lives as commercial vehicles were evacuated from the parks. To this end, the state police command, on Tuesday, deployed officers and men in the parks to forestall the further breakdown of law and order. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mrs Funmi Odunlami, who confirmed the development, said policemen were deployed to avert violence at the parks. She stated, “After the swearing-in of Jacob Adebo, popularly known as Idajo yesterday by the state government, some of his men went to some parks in Akure metro to take over those parks but met stiff resistance.” Copyright PUNCH.
