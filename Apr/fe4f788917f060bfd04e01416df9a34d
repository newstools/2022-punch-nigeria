Residents of Maiduguri, on Tuesday, celebrated the first rainfall of the year that reduced the high temperature being experienced in the city. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the afternoon downpour, which lasted about an hour, reduced the 43 degree Celsius temperature of the state capital to 23 degree Celsius. A resident of Mairi Ward, Malam Abubakar Baba, said that the weather after the rainfall was a big relief to residents, particularly Muslim faithful who were observing the Ramadan fast. “Today’s fast is like a bonus because of the cool weather. You can see that even the sachet of ice block that used to sell for N100 is, today, N50,” Baba said. Other residents, Joshua Musa, Tijjani Bello and Laraba Ishaq also expressed joy with the rainfall, pointing out that people will now have sound sleep. “The weather is nice today with the heat gone; residents will have a nice sleep today,” Mr Mike Nzadvara said.
