Terrorists have launched yet another attack on Gwantu Kurmi community in Sanga Local Government Area of Kaduna State, kidnapping a student of the Kaduna State University, Joshua Arumbus, and a passerby identified as Simon, while other person sustained injury from gunshot. The President of Gwantu People’s Progressive Union, Bala Audu, confirmed the incident on Monday. According to him, the armed men invaded the community on foot on Saturday and started shooting indiscriminately at the residents. It would be recalled that in August 2021, the son of the Administrative Officer to the President, Alhaji Sanusi Maikano, and the son of the District Head of Gwantu, Alhaji Boni Bashir, were kidnapped in the Gwantu community. Audu decried the increasing rate of kidnapping within the local government, while calling on security agencies to improve on their responses to distress calls from the communities. “It is most unfortunate that this incident happened just half a kilometre away from the Gwantu Police Divisional Headquarters and the headquarters of the Operation Safe Haven in Gwantu,” he said. Audu called on the Kaduna State Government to take drastic measures in curtailing the security menace ravaging the state. He also urged the local government to form a local task force in each community that would use any available legal means in defending themselves since they had been experiencing the incident.
