The Araba of Ibadanland and Olu Isese of Oyo State, Ifalere Odegbola, has appealed to the Oyo State Government to declare a public holiday for traditional worshippers like other states. Odegbola said this on Thursday in a statement in which he also commended human rights lawyer, Mr Femi Falana (SAN) for his support of public holidays for traditional worshippers, saying that the position of the law also shows that traditionalists are demanding their rights. He said, “Public holiday for traditional religion worshippers is long overdue and other states in all Yorubaland should emulate Osun State which had declared public holiday for traditional religion worshippers. “As traditional religion worshippers, we are optimistic that very soon Oyo State will equally declare public holiday for traditional religion worshippers. Other States in Yorubaland will equally do the same.” “I also use this medium to commend the efforts of the Oyo State Chapter of Traditional Worshippers Association of Nigeria, under its Chairman, Surveyor Adefabi Dasola, and his Secretary, Mogaji (Dr) Fakayode Fayemi Fatunde, for their steadfastness and commitment to propagation of Yoruba culture and tradition as well as the State Governor, Engineer Seyi Makinde, who has now given room for further dialogue between traditional religion worshippers and his government.” Copyright PUNCH.
