Former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, on Monday, said women are the most reliable allies in politics. The former Edo State Governor noted that their roles cannot be underestimated in Nigerian politics. This is as he pointed out that women are known to be more committed and loyal to both the candidate and the party. He made the assertion at the maiden Edo North APC’s women’s conference, held in Iyamho, Uzairue, Etsako West Local Government Area of the State, organised by the women’s wing of the party. “I must say that women are the most reliable allies in politics and I am admitting that their roles cannot be underestimated in Nigerian politics. “I commended them for coming out from their shell to seek political relevance and hold political offices in our country,” he added. One of the women leaders, Mrs Dame Omua-Okpaku, said the women’s conference is timely and pungent, stating that some of the issues to be raised and debated at the conference will dwell on the rights and privileges of women being currently discussed in the national assembly. The octogenarian mother of the former Edo State Governor, Aishetu Oshiomhole, was the special guest of honour at the conference which also attracted top female politicians in Edo North and other parts of the state.
