THE wife of Lagos State Governor, Dr Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, has urged graduate doctors to stay in service as the state needs their professional input. Sanwo-Olu said this in a statement on Tuesday, adding that the government has committed resources to improve the health sector. The governor’s wife, who was represented by a former Permanent Secretary, Dr Ibironke Sodeinde, gave the advice during the fifth graduation of medical doctors from the School of Anaesthetic Studies of the General Hospital, Badagry. She said, “As an anaesthetist myself and also one of the founding consultants of the anaesthetic school, I want to assure you that I will continue to associate with the progress of this school. “I also want to encourage you to continue to stay in the service of the state government because Lagos needs your professional input in the management of public health and the state government has committed a lot of resources towards improving the health sector, being a strategic pillar of the THEMES development agenda.“ Sanwo-Olu added that the government will continue to support students and health institutions in the state. “There can be no meaningful development when residents are unhealthy, and I want to give you an assurance that the government would continue to support students and health institutions to ensure growth and excellent service delivery,” she said.
