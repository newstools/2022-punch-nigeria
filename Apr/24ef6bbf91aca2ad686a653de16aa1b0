Champions Akwa United will be hoping to get their revenge on league leaders Rivers United when both sides clash on Saturday (today) in a matchday 20 fixture as the business end of the season begins. The Port Harcourt-based side thrashed the champions 4-1 in their matchday 19 fixture a situation that led to the disengagement of interim coach Ali Jolomi and two weeks later, Akwa will be eager to take their pound of flesh. The ‘Promise Keepers’ have gone on to hire former Sunshine Stars coach Ayodeji Ayeni to help return them to where they used to be and at least fight for a continental ticket. Speaking ahead of the match, Ayeni says he is positive of earning a positive result against the leaders. “I’m very happy with the level of determination I have seen from both the old players and the new ones we have brought in to strengthen the team. The calibre of players we have are capable of winning games and I’m confident that we will have a positive result against Rivers United on Saturday. “My coming to Akwa United is a fresh challenge and a new beginning for me as a coach. I have spent one week with my players and I’m happy with the energy and the hard work we have put into the team within this short period of time. “For us to have a successful title defense and also secure one of the continental tickets which is our primary target in the remaining 19 matches, we have to hit the ground running starting with this weekend’s game against Rivers United.” Akwa United are currently sixth on the league table with 27 points, 15 points adrift of Rivers United who have earned 42 points from 19 games. Rivers are unbeaten in their last eight league games.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
