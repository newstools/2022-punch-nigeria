The Nigerian Navy, on Friday, commenced what may be termed its biggest operation aimed at putting an end to oil theft and illegal refining in the Niger Delta with the deployment of 40 ships, five helicopters and 200 boats. The Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo, said this while speaking to newsmen shortly after flagging off Operation ‘Dakatar Da Barawo’ (stop the thief) on board the Nigeria Navy Ship, Okpabana in Onne, Rivers State. Gambo, who was represented by the Chief of Policy and Planning, Rear Admiral Saidu Garba, said the move was to intensify previous efforts as the nation was bleeding as a result of huge losses to the menace of oil theft.
