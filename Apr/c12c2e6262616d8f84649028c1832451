DENTAL surgeon, Chinelo Megafu, who was killed in the Abuja-Kaduna train attack of March 28 has been buried in Lagos. This was after a funeral service was held in her honour at  Shepherdhill Baptist Church, Obanikoro, Lagos, with her family, friends and well-wishers present to pay their last respects to her. Megafu had taken to Twitter on the day the train was attacked by terrorists to announce that she was on board and had been shot. “I’m on the train. I have been shot, please pray for me,” her tweet read. However, some Twitter users labelled it a joke until one Michael Ajidahun who knew a friend of hers confirmed that she was dead. “Just woke up to sad news. My friend just woke up to losing a close friend who was shot while on the Abuja-Kaduna train by terrorists. She tweeted yesterday that we should pray for her. Sadly, she didn’t make it. She was a doctor. I’m heartbroken,” Ajidahun tweeted. Reacting, the Nigerian Medical Association, through a statement by its President, Prof Innocent Ujah, expressed sadness at the news, saying it was one too many. “As an Association, we vehemently decry the worsening insecurity in the country which has made all of us and Nigerians as a whole vulnerable to violent attacks by hoodlums, bandits, kidnappers and terrorists who are currently having a field day causing us deep sorrows and severe pains.” Copyright PUNCH.
