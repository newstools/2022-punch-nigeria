At least seven buildings, including lecture halls and offices, have been destroyed by a whirlwind which wreaked havoc on the University of Jos, Plateau State. It was learnt that the ‘strange’ wind started on Saturday night and lasted till the early morning of Sunday . Some staff of the University, who confirmed the development on Sunday, said the affected structures included the new Taekwondo Gymnasium, new Veterinary Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Agric buildings as well as the JT Useni Mini Stadium located  at the Permanent Site of the institution, among others. The University management, on Sunday, sent a delegation to inspect the level of damage caused to the buildings at the Naraguta Campus of the University. The team, led by the Deputy Vice Chancellor (Academics), Prof Rahila Gowon, on behalf of  the VC, Prof Tanko Ishaya, was also accompanied on the inspection by the Director of Physical Facilities and her Staff. The DVC, who lamented the calamity that had befallen the   University community, described the destruction of facilities at the institution as strange and unfortunate. She, however, promised that the management would do its best to ensure that the destroyed structures, some of which were recently completed, were not left out in their present condition for the good of the students and the University.
