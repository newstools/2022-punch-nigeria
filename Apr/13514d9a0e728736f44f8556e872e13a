Gunmen have invaded the Igboukwu cattle market in Aguata Local Government Area, Anambra State, killing over 20 cows and goats. It was gathered that the gunmen after burning down the Aguata LG secretariat, left for the cattle market where they opened fire on the cows and goats on the ranch. The PUNCH learnt that no life was lost in the incident that happened Thursday night. It was gathered that the owner of the animals, whose identity was not given and other persons around the area scampered to safety as the gunmen shot the animals. A source in the area, Mr Iyke Orji, said, “The gunmen after burning Aguata Local Government secretariat, plied through Ekwulobia and headed straight to Igboukwu. “Stopping at Igboukwu area, there’s a cattle ranch where they sell over 30 cows by your right hand. The gunmen entered there and killed all the cows belonging to an Igbo man.” A video trending on social media also showed dead cows and goats littering the cattle market, with traders bemoaning their losses.
