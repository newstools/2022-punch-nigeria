The Peoples Democratic Party, Zamfara State chapter, said it would soon receive many groups including aggrieved All Progressives Congress members who are planning to join the party and work for its success in the 2023 general elections. The Chairman of the 14 PDP local government chairmen in the state, Nura Umar, made this known while addressing newsmen at the party secretariat in Gusau, on the party’s preparation to receive the groups. He said, “The APC just concluded their national convention and it has taken so many dimensions. Many people were touched because the outcome of the convention did not favour them, so they are ready to leave their party to join us in PDP. They are from the ruling party in the state.” He assured those wishing to join the PDP that members and supporters of the party would accept them in good faith. “They should feel free to come into the party in good faith so that together, we can move the party forward. We, the 14 local government chairmen of the party agreed that we are going to accept anybody that wishes to enter or join the PDP in good faith. We should join hands together and move PDP forward in Zamfara State,” Umar added. He urged them to follow the right procedures for joining the PDP from the ward to local government and state levels, stressing that, “when that is done, members of the party would not have issues with them at all”. He said the PDP needed them and they also needed the PDP and therefore, both of them were important to each other. Umar, however, warned that the PDP would not tolerate anyone nursing the intention to destabilise the party in the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
