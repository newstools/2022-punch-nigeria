The Delta State Police Command has rescued five underage children allegedly trafficked and used as sex slaves inside a brothel located at Aragba in Otokutu in the Ughelli South Local Government Area of the state. The state Commissioner of Police, CP Ari Mohammed Ali, disclosing this to journalists on Wednesday, named the brothel Fagoma. According to the CP, the Command received an intelligence report on April 15, 2022, that the said Fagoma, otherwise registered as a hotel, was “being used as a brothel where underage children are trafficked and used as sex slaves.” Consequently, the Ali said, the Command, upon receiving this disturbing information, raided the brothel, and the five underage girls were rescued: Happiness Johnson (13); Esther Godspower (21); Angel John (22); Miracle Bishop (19); and Happiness Isreal (19). The CP stated further that investigations revealed that one Joy (surname unknown), now at large, trafficked the underage girls from Rivers State and took them to Patani in Delta State, where they were forced into taking an oath before they were brought to Otu-Jeremi, also in Delta and harboured illegally by one Edwin Etareri, the owner of the said brothel and his wife, one Mrs Grace Etariri, currently in custody. Ten other male suspects and ten female suspected prostitutes were also arrested during the raid just as investigation was ongoing on the matter, the CP said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
