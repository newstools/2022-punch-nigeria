The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Abiodun Alabi, has directed all Area Commanders, Divisional Police Officers, Tactical Commanders and Intelligence Officers to deploy adequate human and operational resources to all strategic and vulnerable points across the state to forestall any form of security breach during the Easter period. This is as he charged the personnel to be professional, courteous but firm in the discharge of their duties. Police Public Relations Officer, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, made this known in a statement, titled, ‘Lagos State Police Command Felicitates With Christian Faithful on Easter,’ on Friday. According to the statement, CP Alabi gave the assurances that the emplaced security architecture will be closely monitored and reviewed as required in a bid to sustain the existing peace in Lagos State. “The Command equally enjoins everyone to be security conscious, vigilant and report any untoward incident or happening to the nearest Police Station,” the statement added.
