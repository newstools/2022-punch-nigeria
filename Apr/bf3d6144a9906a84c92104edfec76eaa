The Kogi State Commissioner of Police, Edward Egbuka, led a team of officers on a confidence-boosting and visibility patrol to the major highways across the state, as he vowed to clamp down on criminal elements that might want to disturb the peace of the festive season. He led the team on Saturday to assess the deployment of personnel and operational assets along the major highways across the state. Egbuka explained that the reason for the patrol was to assess the level of compliance with the directives given to the Divisional Police Officers and their supervising Area Commanders to take charge of their area of responsibility. The commissioner also charged them to increase their efforts in curtailing criminal elements who might want to perpetrate evil acts in the Eater period. He also said that the police were committed to working in synergy with other security commanders to provide adequate security in the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
