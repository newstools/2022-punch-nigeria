Just like a wildfire, rave of the moment, Habeeb Okikiola, popularly known as Portable, has made his way into the Nigerian music industry and he is riding on eagles’ wings. Getting recognised in the Nigerian music scene is like climbing Mount Everest due to the wave of talents and household names competing for fans’ attention. However, Portable appeared to have bypassed protocol in his rise to fame since December 2021. Since then, it’s been like a stroll in the park for the Zazzu crooner who has gone on to share the stage with the likes of Olamide, Tiwa Savage and Wizkid. His rise to stardom has come as a surprise to many and he’s getting recognised by the crème de la crème of the Nigerian entertainment industry, including, popular singer, Wande Coal. “God is great 🔥🔥🔥I’m so happy to come from the streets,” Wande commented on one of Portable’s Instagram post after he landed in London. He has also met with Afropop star, Davido, and has gotten recognized by the likes of Oritse Femi and Jaywon. But while it could be almost impossible to see a Portable-like rise to fame anytime soon, WuzupNigeria brings you six celebrities who have been instrumental to his rise that you ought to know. 1. Kogbagidi Portable’s story can’t be told without mentioning popular show promoter Kogbagidi who had been his benefactor. Kogbagidi has worked with the likes of D’Banj, Davido, Dammy Krane, and Zlatan Ibile and he reportedly owns VVIP bars and lounges in Lagos state. Although Portable and Kogbagidi’s relationship has gone sour, the former would be grateful for the exposure he got through the promoter. 2. Poco Lee Popular Nigerian celebrity dancer and hype man, Iweh Pascal Odinaka aka Poco Lee, took Portable’s career to a whole new level when he introduced him to YBNL boss, Olamide. Dubbed, the Voice of the Street, Olamide’s verse on Portable’s hit single, Zazzu, sold the rising star into the hearts of many Nigerians home and abroad. As a result of his relationship with Poco Lee, Portable went on to perform at the Livespot X Festival in Lagos where he shared the stage with Olamide and Wizkid. Yet again, Portable fell out with Poco Lee after the show after accusing the dancer of ‘ripping him off’ the money Wizkid gave him. 3. Olamide The YBNL boss will undoubtedly be credited for lighting the fire on Portable’s career with his verse on the hit single, Zazzu. According to Portable, Olamide single-handedly funded the video of Zazzu with the sum of 8million naira and he would be forever grateful to the rapper. “The boy no go come down anybody who prays for downfall will fall. Olamide paid for Zazzu video. “He paid producers, he flexed us, gave me money, and still paid my video money, eight million naira,” Portable said. 4. Taye Currency All thanks to Kogbagidi, Portable, met Fuji singer, Taiwo Akande Adebisi aka Taye Currency, in Ibadan, Oyo State. The Fuji star lived up to his name by making a financial contribution to the singer’s career. Although the amount on the cheque given to Portable remained undisclosed, Portable appeared extremely grateful in a video he uploaded on Kogbagidi’s verified Instagram page. 5. Obi Cubana Not many people would see this coming but popular Nigerian entrepreneur and businessman, Obinna “Obi” Iyiegbu, commonly known as Obi Cubana, handed Portable a N50 million endorsement deal in March 2022. Announcing the endorsement on his Instagram, Portable wrote, “@obi_cubana don show love ooo. 50 million kwen don zeh for my Aza ooo. Official Ambassador @odogwu_bitters of Africa.” 6. E-Money: Portable landed in London, United Kingdom, this week and he will be performing in three cities all thanks to Emeka ‘E-Money’ Okonkwo, who sponsored his trip to the UK. Portable took to his Instagram page on Tuesday to share photos and videos of himself and the socialite at the airport. “@iam_emoney1 Na Baba God bless you more Godfather You no go fall Thanks to those people way dey show me love from day one,” the Zazzu singer wrote.
