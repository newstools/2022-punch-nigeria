The Lagos State Government has assured residents that it would work with the producers of the contaminated milk, Friesland Campina, to unravel the source of the hazardous product. The General Manager of the Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency, Mr. Afolabi Solebo, disclosed this in a statement made available on Monday. The PUNCH had reported that a warehouse in Isheri area of the state was closed by the government after a video of a reported sale of contaminated milk products in Ojuelegba went viral. Solebo was quoted to have made the promise of unraveling the source during a meeting with stakeholders where he assured residents that the product batch would be subjected to more tests and possibly recall the contaminated milk from markets and distributors. He said, “The agency is not undermining the reputation of the Friesland Campina, makers of the milk product, but is interested in identifying the source of the expired product in order to inform, guide, and protect the general public appropriately. “While we await the result of the laboratory test and investigations of Friesland Campina Plc, LASCOPA, on its part, will also carry out a forensic test on the products in a reputable and accredited laboratory in Lagos.” The Quality Assurance Representative of Friesland Campina Nigeria Plc, Mr. Yomi Eleyoro, expressed the readiness of his organisation to support the move.
