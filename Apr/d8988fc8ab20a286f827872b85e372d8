Eterna Plc says the Securities and Exchange Commission has granted Preline Limited the authority to proceed with the acquisition of 1,300,000 units of ordinary shares, equivalent to about 0.10 per cent stake in Eterna Plc. This came after Eterna Plc, in November 2021, announced the acquisition of over 700 million units of ordinary shares by Preline Limited, to become the largest and majority shareholder of Eterna Plc. Preline Limited, the new majority shareholder in Eterna Plc, said it had concluded arrangements to proceed with a mandatory tender offer to acquire some 1.3 million shares held by minority shareholders. Preline Limited acquired a total of 794,969,774 ordinary shares, representing 60.98 per cent stake in Eterna Plc in November 2021. In a regulatory filing on Wednesday, Eterna stated that Preline had received regulatory approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to proceed with the mandatory tender offer. It read in part, “We wish to announce to Nigerian Exchange Limited and the public that following the granting of the ‘‘authority to proceed’’ by SEC, Preline Limited has notified the company of its intention to proceed with the takeover bid to acquire 1,300,000 ordinary shares equivalent to 0.10 per cent equity stake in Eterna Plc from other shareholders at a price of N13.50 per share.” A few major shareholders of Eterna have decided to sell their equity stakes in the oil and gas company to Preline. Incorporated as a limited liability company in 1989, Eterna became a public limited liability company in 1997 and had its shares listed on the NGX in August 1998.  Copyright PUNCH.
