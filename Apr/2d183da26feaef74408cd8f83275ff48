Rival cults went berserk on Wednesday and Thursday at Adeke around the mobile police barracks, a suburb of Makurdi, Benue State, and set five houses ablaze. It was reliably gathered that the crisis started when a young man suspected to be a member of a cult was killed in the Adem community close to Adeke around noon on Wednesday. It was learnt that members of the rival cult, on hearing the news of the killing of their member, later mobilised for reprisal and invaded the community in the night. A resident of the area, who did not want to be named for fear of the cultists said, “Within a short while, the situation degenerated, leading to shooting and burning of houses. When contacted, the Chairman, Makurdi Local Government Area, Anthony Dyegeh, confirmed the report and described it as a cult attack, adding that policemen had been deployed in the troubled area. Efforts to get the state police command Public Relations Officer, SP Catherine Anene, were not successful as calls made to her cell phone rang out. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
