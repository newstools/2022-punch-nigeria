Everton manager Frank Lampard has hailed the impact of Alex Iwobi in the team’s impressive 1-0 win over Manchester United in the English Premier League on Saturday as they increased their chances of retaining their league status as they moved four points off the relegation zone. Iwobi was in action for the entire duration of the game giving the Toffees a much needed bite in attack after being converted into the attacking midfield role in the game. According to Liverpool Echo’s rating of the encounter, Iwobi scored the highest record of eight out of 10 for his performance, the same number as Jordan Pickford, Anthony Gordon and Fabian Delph. However, the highest accolade comes from his manager who revealed that the Nigeria international is one of the players the club can rely on for their hopes of survival. “Alex is one who people can see I rely on. We’ve moved his position, we’ve changed in and he’s offered so much,” Lampard said after the match. “I think you could feel the crowd’s reaction towards him today (Saturday) with his energy and qualities. “I don’t know how many kilometres he’s run this week but he’s done it again today. “It is character and Premier League players get questioned in difficult moments. A lot of questions asked about them and me over the last few days, especially if you make those individual errors.” Iwobi who joined Everton on deadline day in the summer of 2019 has struggled for form and consistency for the club but has since had a change of performance since Lampard joined the team.
