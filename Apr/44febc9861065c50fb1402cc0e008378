London-based Nigerian Disk Jockey, Florence Otedola, popularly known as DJ Cuppy, has vowed to work on being a better sister and daughter this year. The daughter of Nigerian billionaire, Femi Otedola, made this known on her Instagram page on Tuesday. Sharing a picture of herself, her mum, Nana Otedola; and her brother, Fewa; Cuppy noted that family is for life. Noting that she’d be turning 30 this year, Cuppy states that maturity would come when one started making changes and stopped making excuses. She wrote, “This year, I’m going to intentionally work on being a better sister and a better daughter. “Work is work, but family is for life. I’m going to be 30 this year and maturity comes when you stop making excuses and you start making changes. #FamilyFirst.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
