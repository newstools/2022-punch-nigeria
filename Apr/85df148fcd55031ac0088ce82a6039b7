Manchester United interim boss Ralf Rangnick makes six changes to the side that drew 1-1 at home to Leicester last weekend. This is as Nigeria’s Alex Iwobi starts for Everton in the Premier League encounter. For United, Alex Telles replaces the injured Luke Shaw at left-back while Aaron Wan-Bissaka is recalled at right-back instead of Diogo Dalot. Victor Lindelof replaces Raphael Varane in defence. In midfield, there is no Scott McTominay as Nemanja Matic starts alongside Fred while Anthony Elanga and Paul Pogba drop to the bench in place of Marcus Rashford and Cristiano Ronaldo – who is back from illness. Everton midfielder Allan and defender Michael Keane return from suspension and are likely to go straight back into the side for the visit of Manchester United. Right-back Seamus Coleman is also likely to start, having been an unused substitute for the midweek defeat at Burnley because of illness. Centre-back Yerry Mina, out since early February with a thigh injury, could return for Everton’s next match at home to Leicester on April 20. Man United team to face Everton: De Gea, Wan-Bissaka, Telles, Lindelof, Maguire, Matic, Fred, Fernandes, Sancho, Rashford, Ronaldo. Subs: Heaton, Henderson, Jones, Pogba, Mata, Lingard, Dalot, Elanga, Mejbri. Everton team to face Manchester United: Pickford, Coleman, Mykolenko, Keane, Godfrey, Allan, Delph, Iwobi, Gordon, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Begovic, Kenny, Holgate, Gray, Doucoure, Gomes, Branthwaite, Rondon, Alli. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
