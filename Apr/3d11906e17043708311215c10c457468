The Rivers State Police Command has said its operatives have arrested four suspected kidnappers who have been terrorising residents of Egwi-Etche and its environs in Etche Local Government Area of Rivers State. The command’s acting spokesperson, Grace Iringe-Koko, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday. Iringe-Koko said their arrest came after they abducted a cleric from a new generation church based in Port Harcourt in February. The statement read, “Luck ran out of them when they abducted one Pastor Jeremiah Atelibo of Salvation Ministry Church, Port Harcourt on February 28, 2022. “Operatives, using artificial intelligence, were able to locate and storm their hideout and arrested four suspects namely Barisi Yikes (31), Chinedu Simeon (28), Justice Obodo (32) and Jeffrey (28). Their victim, Pastor Atelibo was rescued unhurt. “A locally-made pistol with three live cartridges was recovered from them, among other exhibits. “In a related development following a report of kidnap by one Karibo Awantaye, about a Bolt driver who was kidnapped along Rumubiakani on Eneka Road in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area on March 19, 2022, police swung into action and the kidnappers were traced and given a hot chase. “On sighting the police, gun duel ensued with the kidnappers.
