Despite suffering defeat to Akwa United on Sunday, Mohammed Baba Ganaru, head coach of Nigeria Professional Football League side, Lobi Stars, was pleased with the performance of his lads, while also praising their hosts. The Makurdi-based club narrowly lost 1-0 in a thrilling encounter at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium, Uyo. A Bello Martins’ 36th-minute striker was all that separated the two sides on match-day 25 of the 2021/22 NPFL season. It was Lobi Stars’ third defeat in their last five matches, as they currently occupy the 16th position with 26 points, three points more than MFM, who sit bottom of the table. Speaking after the game, Baba Ganaru admitted that his side were second best in the encounter. “It was a very good match and I think we lost against a team of the moment,” the coach said. “If you look at their league performance in the previous season, Akwa are one of the teams that are doing very well, they’ve made some changes to their squad. I must confess I’m very impressed with the performance of Akwa United.” On their next home fixtures, he said, “We have two matches to play next at home and we need to get the maximum points because if we are able to do that we will be able to get out of the position that we are at the moment and that is our objective. “We also need to start picking points away from home, but we are improving gradually because before I took over they lost five consecutive matches. Now we are managing to pick points at home but we need to start doing so away from home.” Lobi welcome Nasarawa United on match-day 26 on Sunday as they hope to return to winning ways and survive the drop.
