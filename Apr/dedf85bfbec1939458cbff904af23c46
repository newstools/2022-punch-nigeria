A truck accident on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway has barred motorists travelling outward Lagos. The truck fell across the Kara axis of the road, forcing a column of oncoming vehicles to a standstill. A frustrated driver who gave his name only as Kingsley said the accident occurred at 11:20pm. He said he was driving to an estate within the OPIC area. He said, “We are trapped and there is no movement as you can see. Except there is an urgent effort to take it (truck) away this night, I am not sure of getting to my destination this night.” Our correspondent observed that there was no rescue operation ongoing but some unruly drivers had taken advantage of the development to drive against traffic. Also, the accident has worsened vehicular movements on the Berger end of the expressway, including the Oba Ogunji road, Ogba, as of 12:03am. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
