THE Lagos State Traditional Medicine Board has urged traditional medicine practitioners in Ikorodu Division of the state to obey the rules guiding their practice. The Chairman of LSTMB, Prof. Adebukunola Adefule-Ositelu, disclosed this, according to a statement on Sunday, at a sensitisation event held at the palace of Ayangburen of Ikorodu. She said, “I want to strongly advise practitioners and stakeholders to comply with the law to avoid any unpleasant development. “The state government has put necessary machinery in place for seamless registration and proper coordination, and all you need to do is visit the board for adequate support and guidance.” The Registrar, LSTMB, Mr Olorunkemi Kadiku, told the practitioners that rules and regulations were laid down to ensure proper monitoring. “The rules and regulations guiding your practice include but are not limited to stopping indiscriminate street hawking, especially by the ‘alagbos’ (herbs sellers), belonging to an association and having a specific office address for ease of monitoring and regulation,” he said. The Ayangburen of Ikorodu, Oba Abdulkabir Shotobi, stated that compliance with government regulations is for the benefits of traditional practitioners and the general good of the populace.
