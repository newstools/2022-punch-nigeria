Following the frequent attacks on police formations and personnel in the South-East by armed assailants, the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, has ordered the immediate deployment of additional operational assets to complement officers and men attached to ‘Operation Restore Peace.’ The PUNCH reports that scores of police officers had been killed and stations attacked by armed hoodlums clamouring to actualise the Biafra republic. On April 13, gunmen killed four police officers, including a female cop, during an attack on a police station in Atani, the headquarters of Ogbaru Local Government Area of Anambra State. The attack reportedly took place at about 1am. However, in a statement on Thursday, the IG condemned the spate of attacks on police officers, facilities, and other police operational assets around the nation. He warned that attacks on police officers in the line of duty would no longer be tolerated under whatever guise “as the force holds the lives of its personnel sacrosanct, and such unwarranted attacks would be strictly treated under extant laws.” Baba in a statement by the police spokesman, Muyiwa Adejobi, reiterated “the commitment of the force to protection of lives and property while stressing that it is vital to respect the lives and fundamental rights of police officers and other security operatives to enable them to advance their sacred mandate of serving and protecting the citizens better.” Copyright PUNCH.
