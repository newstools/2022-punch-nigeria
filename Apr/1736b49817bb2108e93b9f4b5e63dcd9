The Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, has condemned the recent bomb attack in Iware, Ardo Kola Local Government Area of the state. Several lives were lost, and several others were injured in the explosion. In a press statement issued in Jalingo and signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Bala Dan-Abu, Ishaku described the attack as barbaric, wicked, and unprovoked aggression against innocent people. The governor’s statement came a few minutes after the Islamic State of West Africa Province allegedly claimed responsibility for the attack. According to Reuters, the terror group in a statement posted late on Wednesday on a Telegram messaging channel used to distribute its propaganda, described those who detonated the bomb in the market as “soldiers of the caliphate in central Nigeria.” The ISWAP statement said the attack had struck “a gathering of infidel Christians” and expressed satisfaction that the drinking spot had been damaged. It did not break down the casualty figure into dead and injured. But the state government, in the statement, said security agencies had been directed to go after the perpetrators of the crime and make them pay for their sins. While expressing sympathy to the families of those killed in the attack, the Governor promised government assistance for those injured and hospital treatment. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
