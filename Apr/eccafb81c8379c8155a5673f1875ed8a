Boxing heavyweight prospect of Nigerian descent, David Adeleye, will bid to remain unbeaten when he takes on Chris Healey on a historic night at Wembley on Saturday – just like sparring partner Tyson Fury. Adeleye is undefeated in his eight professional fights so far and Healey, a Lancashire southpaw will also be aiming back-to-back wins having defeated Danny Whitaker a fortnight ago. The 25-year-old, Adeleye will fight Healey on the undercard of Fury’s domestic dust-up with former sparring partner Dillian Whyte on Saturday night. Born in London in 1996 to Nigerian parents, Adeleye is regarded as Britain’s latest heavyweight prospect and has been a key member of Fury’s training camp for Whyte’s bout was cheered on by the Gypsy King during his open workout on Tuesday afternoon. Adeleye – who has also trained with former unified heavyweight champ Anthony Joshua – has been tipped by many to make a fast rise up the heavyweight ranks. Adeleye dreams of fighting for the British and Commonwealth titles. He said, “Whichever belt comes first is the one I go for. I’ll take all of them. “I want to get in the history books as a world heavyweight champion, and deliver some of the biggest fight nights for British boxing.”
