Gunmen suspected to be cultists have killed the commander of a disbanded vigilante group in the Obelle community, Emohua Local Government Area of Rivers State. It was gathered that the armed men invaded the community and opened fire on the victim identified as Amos. The deceased was said to be a commander of the disbanded group called Onelga Peace Security Advisory Committee. It was also gathered that another yet-to-be-identified vigilante member was attacked but later escaped. A member of the local vigilante who confirmed the killing said that the members of the gang had shot several times at their targets, but the bullets failed to penetrate their bodies. The killing of the vigilante commander had heightened tension in the community as residents fled the community. Calm had, however, returned to the area as nearby vigilante groups and some security operatives had moved in to arrest the situation. When contacted, the acting spokesman of the State police command, Grace Iringe-Koko, said that she was yet to receive the report of the incident. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
