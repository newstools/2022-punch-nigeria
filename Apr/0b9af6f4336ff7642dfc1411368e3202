The United States Embassy and its implementing partner, CyArk, on Wednesday, presented the results of its project to document and help protect the Busanyin Shrine in the Osun Osogbo Sacred Grove. According to a statement made available to The PUNCH, the step was meant to demonstrate leadership and respect for Nigeria’s cultural heritage. The Director-General of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments, Professor Abba Tijani, was said to have received the results and praised CyArk’s efforts. The statement read, “CyArk is a California-based non-profit organisation that specialises in the digital documentation of cultural sites.  In 2020, the U.S. Department of State awarded CyArk a $125,000 grant to undertake the Busanyin Shrine project in partnership with the Adunni Olorisa Trust and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments. “One of eight monuments within the grove, the Busanyin Shrine was damaged by seasonal flooding in 2019.  CyArk trained NCMM staff in the use of three-dimensional laser scanning technology to document the Busanyin Shrine. “A principal focus was on using the process of photogrammetry to create a digital model from images combined from multiple sources.  The model offers a unique and precise digital record for use in planning future projects and preservation initiatives, including an engineering plan to protect the monument against future flooding. “In support of future plans, the project team also conducted depth readings in the area of historical flooding to better understand the hydrology of the Osun River.” Copyright PUNCH.
