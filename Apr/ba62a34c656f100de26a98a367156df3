New research examining eye gaze behaviour has found that looking at people’s bodies, rather than their faces, is linked with harmful attitudes towards sexual assault. The paper ‘Body Gaze as a Marker of Sexual Objectification: A New Scale for Pervasive Gaze and Gaze Provocation Behaviours in Heterosexual Women and Men’ was published in the Journal Archives of Sexual Behaviour, dated March 31, 2022. The study, carried out by a team of intelligentsia at the Edith Cowan University, observes that those who ogle are more likely to have harmful attitudes. Eye contact is notably one common way of communication around the world, which is, however, construed in different ways in different climes. While some cultures see it as a hallmark of disrespect, others consider it as disrespectful. So, to play on the safer side, it is always advised to be attuned to the varying eye-contact traditions across the world In many Western countries, it is construed as assault and rude to ogle, conversely, in most African countries, it is seldom considered a crime. According to TheTravel, In China, for instance, people make eye contact when they are angry, as it is meant to challenge the other person and is also a sign of disrespect. Similarly in Iran, eye contact is much considered inappropriate for the opposite gender. Out of respect, both persons are supposed to lower their gaze when communicating with the opposite sex. In India, staring at a woman for 14 seconds could put a man in serious trouble. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
