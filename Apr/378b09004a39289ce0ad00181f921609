THE President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has mourned the passing of the former Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Dangote Cement, Joseph Makoju, who was also a former managing director of the defunct National Electric Power Authority. According to a statement signed on Wednesday by his Senior Special Assistant on Media & Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari said Makoju’s historic contributions to the development of the nation would  always be remembered, particularly in the power and cement sectors. The statement is titled ‘President Buhari sympathises with Joseph Makoju’s family over passing of the renowned technocrat,’ It read in part, “President Buhari condoles with family members, Government and people of Kogi State, colleagues and associates of the seasoned technocrat, who deployed his knowledge, skills and experience to the service of his country and humanity. “The President believes that Makoju’s historic contributions to the development of the nation will always be remembered, particularly in the power and cement sectors, where he held notable positions, which includes heading West Africa Portland Cement Company, part of Lafarge, and distinguished himself.” Buhari, therefore, prayed for the repose of the departed soul, and God’s covering over his family.
