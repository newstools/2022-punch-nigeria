A former Minister of Information, Labaran Maku, has returned to the Peoples Democratic Party, to contest the office of Governor of Nasarawa State alongside the incumbent, Abdullahi Sule, in the 2023 general election. Maku returned to the PDP after eight years in the All Progressives Grand Alliance, where he was the National Secretary until his return to the party. Speaking on Wednesday at his electoral ward in Wakama, Nasarawa-Eggon Local Government Area of the state, the former Minister said his decision to join the PDP was in response to the yearnings of residents of Nasarawa state ahead of the 2023 general election. Confirming his defection, the Publicity Secretary of the PDP in the state, Ibrahim Hamza, said that the party was glad to receive Maku into its fold and appealed to other founding members of the party who had defected to other political parties, to return to the PDP, saying the umbrella was big enough to accommodate all members of the party. He said, “We are happy that Maku is back to the PDP. We also want to appeal to our members who left the party for one reason or the other, to return because we are now a very united party and we are ready to take over power in 2023. “We are working towards having consensus candidates for the 2023 general election so that we won’t have issues in the party and it would make it easy for us to take over power from the All Progressives Congress government.” Our correspondent reports that Maku, who defected from the PDP in 2015 after an unsuccessful attempt to clinch the party’s governorship ticket, contested the Nasarawa state governorship position in 2015 and 2019 under the platform of APGA.
