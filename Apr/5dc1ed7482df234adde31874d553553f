Reality TV star, Iheme Uloma, popularly called Ifu Ennada,  says the reason she has not attended church in years is that pastors are misinterpreting what the Bible says. Citing an example, Ifu Ennada, in a post on Instagram, said a preacher once told his congregation to sow special seeds of N50,000 to receive special blessings during a church programme. The actress said the church was just a building where people gathered to worship, adding that what mattered most was people’s faith and relationship with God. She said, “I haven’t been to church in years. The churches I was attending at the time were trying to kill my faith in Christ. A lot of the things they did were the opposite of what the Bible says. Imagine a preacher saying he has special blessings for the church, but only for people who can sow special seeds of N50k and above. “What about people who gladly sow their all even if it’s less than N50k. Did we pay for the sacrifice Christ made on the cross? Could we ever pay for it? Anyway, I chose Christ and left the church. I think what matters is that we have faith in God and that we have a personal relationship with Him because, at the end of the day, the church is just a building where people gather to worship, the temple is in us. Our body is the temple of God.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
