THE Lagos State Government has advised residents to cooperate with the state and Private Sector Participation operators as part of efforts to maintain a clean environment. The Managing Director of the Lagos Waste Management Authority, Mr Ibrahim Odumboni, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday, adding that the agency is ready to meet the waste management needs of residents, during and after the Easter festivities. He said, “LAWMA would leave no stone unturned towards ensuring that the season is celebrated in a clean environment, given the anticipated increase in waste output during the period and we have intensified our advocacy campaigns to sensitise residents to the importance of ensuring environmental sustainability around their neighbourhoods. “PSP operators have been mandated to work optimally in assigned areas, with the authority providing backup operations to cover service gaps. All district heads across the state have also been mandated to double their efforts and support the PSP operations to ensure no gap is felt. “We have also taken definite steps to facilitate increased turnaround time by waste evacuation trucks, making sure there are no delays at landfills.” Odumboni also urged citizens to patronise assigned PSP and pay their waste management bills promptly. “We want to urge the populace to bag their waste, patronise assigned PSP operators and pay their waste management bills promptly and we implore residents to desist from all acts capable of degrading the environment and appeal to motorists to drive with caution in order to safeguard the lives of street sweepers and other service providers discharging their duties,” he added.
