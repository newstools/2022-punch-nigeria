The family of a five-year-old girl, Success Abi, has been thrown into confusion following her disappearance in Abuja. Her mother, Agnes, said she went missing on March 30 after she (Agnes) left her with her 13-year-old brother to buy something at a shop close to their house in Kpeyegi, along Karu-Karshi Expressway, Abuja. She said the brother informed her that a woman persuaded him to allow her to buy Success a drink at a shop close to their house. The distraught mother told our correspondent on Sunday that when the shop owner was interrogated, she said she did not know the woman. She said, “On March 30, I went to buy something at a shop close to my house. Somebody came to my house and picked Success up in the name of wanting to buy something for her at a shop close to my house. “The strange woman was standing in front of our house and Success’ brother was in the compound, playing with her. He said the woman told him that she wanted to buy Bobo for her. “The shop owner said she checked, but she only saw her back. She said she did not bother herself, thinking that it was someone we knew. I have reported the matter at the Jikwoyi Police Station.” Several calls to the FCT Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Josephine Adeh, were not answered. She had yet to respond to a text message sent to her line on the matter as of the time of filing this report. Success’ disappearance is happening less than a week after three siblings disappeared from their school, Star Child Heritage Academy, at the Kabusa area of the FCT. The children, Marvelous, 8; Alex, 5; and Mirabel, 2, have not been found.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
