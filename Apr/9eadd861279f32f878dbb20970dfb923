Nigerian artiste, Ayo Balogun, aka Wizkid, has congratulated Angelique Kidjo, for winning the Best Global Music Album at the 2022 Grammy Awards. Wizkid, who was nominated in the Best Global Music Performance category, and the Best Global Music Album category, lost the two nominations during the awards. However, in an Instagram post on Tuesday, Wizkid, congratulated Angelique Kidjo, and another artiste, Black Coffee, saying they were shining the light on the African continent through their music and achievements. The post read, “Love to my brother, a true king @realblackcoffee and Queen @angeliquekidjo for the wins and for consistently shining light to the continent. African music (is) rising.” Angelique Kidjo also reposted Wizkid’s congratulatory message on Instagram. Wizkid’s Essence was defeated by Arooj Aftab’s Mohabaat for the Best Global Music Performance award. Similarly, Made in Lagos, which was nominated for Best Global Music Album, lost to Angelique Kidjo’s Mother Nature. While Wizkid was yet to make comments regarding the awards, his army of fans, also known as Wizkid FC, took to Kidjo’s social media page to vent their anger. Following this, the songstress had disabled the comments section on her Instagram celebration post. However, this did not deter fans who took to her previous posts to express their discontent about her success. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
