THE Nigerian Ports Authority has proven its readiness to consolidate on the growth of container vessel traffic in the eastern ports with the successful berthing of a vessel, MV Lady Jane. The vessel with an overall length of 295 metres and a draft of 12 metres, was berthed at the West African Container Terminal, in Onne Port Complex, River State on Wednesday. Addressing journalists on Wednesday at Onne, the Managing Director, NPA, Mohammed Bello-Koko, who was represented at the event by the Onne Port Manager, Stanley Yitnoe, said the berthing of the vessels showed the commitment of the authority in repositioning the eastern ports towards productivity. He said, “What this milestone signpost is the fact the initiatives of the authority geared towards repositioning the eastern ports for productivity are yielding results and that Onne Port Complex is fast becoming an attraction for container vessel traffic. However, we cannot afford to rest on our laurels; we must continually strive to surpass stakeholders’ expectations” He also commended the sailors for the professionalism demonstrated in the effortless and safe berthing of the vessel. Bello assured them that in addition to the palliative works that had already begun on the arterial roads in Onne Port, full-scale rehabilitation of infrastructure, as well as improvement of port security through illumination and deployment of access control to check unauthorised entry, was top on management priority.
