Hyundai Motor Group’s Executive Chairman, Euisun Chung, has won the ‘Visionary of the Year’ award at the inaugural Newsweek World’s Greatest Auto Disrupters event held recently. The World’s Greatest Auto Disruptors 2022 programme has evolved from Newsweek America’s 50 Greatest Disruptors – a list of visionaries, innovators and pioneers – introduced in 2021. The new awards recognise agents of change in the automotive industry who are using technology in ways that will profoundly and positively impact people’s lives. According to a statement, Newsweek recognised Chung for his significant role in the rise of Hyundai and Kia in the global automotive industry. “Today’s leading automakers are pushing the boundaries in ways that keep us moving and also capture the imagination. The disruptors on this list deserve to be recognized for pushing the industry forward, as well as for their leadership in responding to the challenges brought on by the pandemic,” said Global Editor in Chief, Newsweek, Nancy Cooper. Receiving the award, Executive Chair, Chung said, “On behalf of everyone at Hyundai Motor Group, I would like to thank Newsweek for these three prestigious awards. They reflect the hard work of all our people and business partners, who are focused on transforming the group into a smart mobility solutions provider with sustainability at the core of what we do. Their dedication to making disruptive technologies a reality is why I am here to share this honour.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
