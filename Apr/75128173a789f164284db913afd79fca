The National President of Trade Union Congress of Nigeria, Quadri Olaleye, has said the All Progressive Congress-led Federal Government has performed below the expectations of every Nigerian. Olaleye was speaking on Friday in Okene at the burial of the late Secretary General of TUC, Musa Ozigi, who was killed in the Abuja/Kaduna bandit attack last Monday alongside Kwara State Chairman, Amin Akinsola. Olaleye advised the President, Maj. Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, to resign if he could not provide adequate security for the citizens. He said, “Nobody is safe in the country again, Children can no longer go to school, we cannot travel again and we cannot close our two eyes when sleeping. If the President cannot provide security for the citizens, then he should resign as President. “Government would have saved the situation if only they are proactive. If government had listened to the people about the worsening security situation in the country, this situation wouldn’t have occurred again.” Olaleye stressed that people voted for him in 2015 because he promised to solve all the problems of insecurity in the country. He pointed out that the late general secretary of the TUC was the engine room of the union, adding that he (Ozigi) was on his way to Kaduna for their meeting when he was attacked with others in the train. He mentioned that the attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train that killed Ozigi and Akinsola had shown that the All Progressives Congress had failed woefully in their major task of providing security for the people. He therefore called of the Federal Government to take a proactive step in solving the problem of insecurity in the country.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
