The Coalition of Northern Youth Support Group, an affiliate of Arewa Youth Assembly has described Professor Kingsley Moghalu as the answer to Nigeria. The national coordinator of the CNYSG said this during the endorsement of Moghalu, a presidential aspirant from the South-East at Arewa House, Kaduna. The former Central Bank of Nigeria’s Deputy Governor was invited to come under the platform of the All Progressives Congress. The coalition of over 57 non-governmental organisations described Moghalu as good material and capable to be the president come 2023. “We are not forgetting that during the first four years of his leadership, he was able to improve the lives of Nigerian citizens by mapping out an economy and growth plan which focused on restoring economy by stabilizing the macro- economic environment, achieving agriculture and food security, ensuring energy sufficiency and improving transportation,” they said. The group identified Moghalu as a transformational leader with consistent track record of high impact success in domains including central banking, economic policy, development policy and finance, governance, transparency and accountability, international affairs and law.
