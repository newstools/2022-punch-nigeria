The Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Ogunwusi, has urged the Lagos State House of Assembly to persuade other state Assemblies in Yoruba-speaking areas to conduct their House sessions in Yoruba language. According to a statement issued on Monday by the Chief Press Secretary to the Speaker of the House, Eromosele Ebhomele, the monarch said this during his meeting with the Speaker, Dr Mudashiru Obasa, in Lagos. He said, “I am very happy to be here and see the Lagos State House of Assembly, using the Yoruba language to conduct its activities. I, therefore, enjoin all other Houses of Assembly in Yorubaland to take a cue from this House. “People in other countries honour and cherish Yoruba language, but sadly here at home, we seem not to cherish what is ours. I, therefore, urge the Lagos State House of Assembly, to do all within its power to persuade other state Assemblies in Yoruba speaking areas, to see the sense, in conducting their House businesses in Yoruba, like this, is one of the surest ways to promote our language and cultural heritage.” Meanwhile, the House also passed a bill to establish a training institute for law enforcement officers in the state. The ‘Bill for the establishment of Lagos State training institute, to provide for the training of law enforcement officers,’ was read for the third time and subsequently passed at a sitting presided over by Obasa. Thereafter, the Speaker directed the Clerk of the House, Olalekan Onafeko, to send a clean copy of the bill to the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, for assent. Copyright PUNCH.
