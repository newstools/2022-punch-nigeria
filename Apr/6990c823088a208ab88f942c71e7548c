As the Sallah celebration draws near, a former Governor of Lagos State and 2023 presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, has distributed 3,000 bags of rice to Muslim faithful in Nasarawa State.  Tinubu, while distributing the bags of rice on Friday in Lafia, urged the beneficiaries not to sell the rice but to use it for the purpose it was meant for, saying that the gesture was also aimed at improving on their standard of living.   The APC presidential aspirant was represented by the Nasarawa State Coordinator of the Bola Ahmed Tinubu Asiwaju Campaign Organisation, Yusuf Omaki. He said, “This gesture is to provide succour to the people, especially the less privileged in Nasarawa State, ahead of this year’s Eid-el-Fitr celebrations. “I want to also use this opportunity to call on all Nigerians to scout out for competent leaders ahead of next year’s general election so as to curb the socio-economic challenges undermining the development of the country. “So, I am soliciting the support of the APC members and all Nigerians to enable me succeed in my presidential ambition.  “The 3,000 bags of rice allocated to Nasarawa State would be distributed to socio-cultural organisations, religious bodies, professional groups and the APC party stalwarts.” Copyright PUNCH.
