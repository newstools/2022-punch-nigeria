Nigeria’s Afrobeats singer, Ayodeji Balogun, popularly known as Wizkid has congratulated veteran singer, Angelique Kidjo and Disk Jockey, Black Coffee for their wins at the 2022 Grammy awards. Wizkid wrote on his Instagram stories on Tuesday, “Love to my brother, a true King, @realblackcoffee and Queen @angeliqueKidjo for consistently shining light on the continent. African music rising.” Kidjo’s Mother Nature bagged the award for the Best Global Music Album on Sunday, while Black Coffee’s Subconsciously won the Best Dance/Electronic Album. While Wizkid’s Made In Lagos and hit song, Essence were nominated for the Best Global Music Album and Best Global Music Performance, respectively, they both did not win in their categories. Big Wiz’s congratulatory message was coming amid attacks by his fans on Kidjo, who felt his album was more deserving of the award. Echoing popular sentiments, British model, Naomi Campbell also criticized the Grammys for being “tone-deaf on what is going in the universe.” According to her, Wizkid’s album and song were wrongly categorised and should have been in the song of the year category Copyright PUNCH.
