After a successful test last month, Twitter is rolling out two accessibility features and adding  to its alt text feature. According to a report by TechCrunch, images with alt text will now contain an ‘ALT’ badge in the corner of the image. The report said, “For a while now, Twitter has made it easy to add alt text to image uploads, allowing tweeters to provide a description of an image to aid people who use screen readers or speech-to-text programs. “But until now, you haven’t been able to see what images do or do not have alt text if you weren’t using a screen reader yourself — so, for example, if you wanted to make sure that the content that you retweet was accessible to followers who might be blind or have limited vision, you’d just have to retweet and hope for the best. “When you hover over the badge, you’ll see the user-generated image description. “Oftentimes on social media, users who don’t have disabilities aren’t thinking about how their posting habits — even sharing certain meme formats — can adversely affect disabled users’ experience online, or prevent them from joining the conversation.” According to social media accessibility expert, Alexa Heinrich, this feature is a step in the right direction because it makes the presence of alt text more apparent, prompting users to learn about the accessibility practice. She said, “One, it makes it more obvious who’s writing alt text and who isn’t. Second, the feature is a great learning tool for anyone who wants to get better at writing alt text because now you can easily see what others are writing.”
