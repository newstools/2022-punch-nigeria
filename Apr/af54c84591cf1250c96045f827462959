After a goal and assist for Shooting Stars Sports Club, forward Moses Omoduemuke expressed delight at being pivotal in the 2-0 win over Enyimba in Ibadan on Monday. Omoduemuke deployed a lethal instinct to tap home his first goal for the Oluyole Warriors in the 14th minute after Enyimba goalkeeper had parried Malomo Taofeeq’s effort. The former Rivers United attacker turned provider five minutes before the halftime break. He benefited from Enyimba’s failure to clear their lines and selflessly set up Emmanuel Lucky, who tapped into an empty net for his third goal of the season and 3SC’s second of the Nigeria Professional Football League match-day 25 encounter. Omoduemuke disclosed how he shrugged off illness and mentally prepared himself to break the duck against Enyimba. “I’m so delighted with the way I played today (Monday). For the past few games, I was not feeling fine. I had typhoid and had to treat that. But I’m happy to put that behind me and show what I’m made of today,” Omoduemuke said. “I knew I would score, right from our preparation. I did my personal training. I also did my prayers. I was very confident that my goals would start counting today. So, I’m happy I did it and helped the team too,” he added
