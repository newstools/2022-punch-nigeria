Two Abia businessmen are set to issue a N200m cheque for the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and the Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu, to purchase their APC presidential expression of interest forms. The Igbere, Bende Local Government Area of Abia State’s businessmen, Ukaegbu James and Nnanna Kalu, made the announcement yesterday evening in Abuja, stating that both Lawan and Kalu were competent leaders to succeed the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in 2023. They noted that the APC needed a unifier and committed leader with a good knowledge of Nigeria, adding “If we must get it right in 2023, we need result-oriented leaders like Kalu and Lawan to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. “It is time to present our best hands because there won’t be any room for writing of fake results and we are ready to make N200m available by weekend to purchase their nomination forms. “We are convinced by their track record, managerial skills, experience and leadership acumen.” Copyright PUNCH.
