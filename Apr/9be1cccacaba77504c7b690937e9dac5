A former Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, has resigned from the Peoples Democratic Party’s zoning committee over his presidential ambition. Fayose made this known in a letter dated April 5, 2022, and addressed to the Chairman of the PDP zoning committee and Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom. “Having hinted during our last meeting at my intention to run for the office of the President in the coming primary election and by God’s grace; the general election. it will not be morally right to continue to participate in the zoning debate being an aspirant myself. ”Therefore, my state has nominated the bearer of this letter Dr Gbenga Faseluko to replace me,” Fayose wrote. Fayose had indicated an interest in becoming Nigeria’s president in 2023 last Thursday while debunking reports that he had endorsed another presidential aspirant, Peter Obi. Fayose, a two-term governor of Ekiti, had said, “Report credited to me that I endorsed Peter Obi for President and zoning of the Presidency to the South-East is false. No doubt, I have great respect for Peter Obi as a leader and I respect his aspiration, but at no point did I endorse his presidential ambition or that the presidency be zoned to South-East. “Rather, my take is that the presidency be zoned to the Southern part of Nigeria. “May I also state clearly that I will be seeking the ticket of the PDP to contest the next presidential election.” Copyright PUNCH.
