Terrorists have released the picture of the newly-born girl delivered by one of the pregnant women they took hostage. The mother of the baby was said to be eight-month pregnant as of the time she and 62 others were abducted by terrorists on the Abuja-Kaduna train on March 28, 2022. Out of the 63 abducted train passengers, only the Managing Director of the Bank of Agriculture, Alwan Hassan, has regained his freedom after he was alleged to have paid a N100m ransom. Meanwhile, almost one month after the abduction, one of the two pregnant women among those abducted by the terrorists, was delivered of a baby girl. The terrorists released the picture of the baby girl on Wednesday night. The picture of the baby girl showed her clad in a thick pink dress and a light lemon sweater cap, with her eyes closed. Meanwhile, the Christian Association of Nigeria in Kaduna State has asked Christians to pray for the safe release of the kidnapped victims still in terrorist’s hostage. According to the association’s state Chairman, Rev John Hayab, “The Christian body will not cease offering prayers until the victims regain their freedom from their captors. “To those the terrorists and bandits are holding hostage, we love you and will not cease to pray and play our role till you all come back safely while we hope that our country is liberated from all forms of criminality.” The association also knocked the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, for not showing enough sympathy for the victims. Rather, it said the minister has been going about pursuing his presidential ambition. The association also called on the Federal Government to instruct security operatives to rescue the victims unhurt. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
