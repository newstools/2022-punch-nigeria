The Yobe State Police Command has confirmed the killing of 10 persons by Boko Haram terrorists in Damaturu, the state capital. It also said several others were wounded in the attack which occurred in Geidam town. The victims were said to be in a local beer parlour, popularly known as Kwari, on the outskirts of the town when the insurgents struck on Wednesday. A source had said the insurgents killed a young man registering SIM cards in the town because they disagreed with him. But the spokesman for the Command, ASP Dungus Abdulkarim, told the News Agency of Nigeria on Saturday that the insurgents who operated on motorcycles also torched the staff quarters of a public school in the area. Abdulkarim said the command sympathised with the community over the attack and urged the residents to report suspicious movements and persons in their communities to security agencies “Currently, normalcy has returned and people are going about their normal business as security operatives were deployed for patrols and visibility policing to avert future occurrence of the attack,” he added.
