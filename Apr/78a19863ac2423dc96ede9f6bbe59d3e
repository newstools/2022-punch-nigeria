AC Milan defender, Pierre Kalulu, has labelled Nigeria international Victor Osimhen the most dreadful striker he has come up against in his career, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The young defender has been a regular for Milan this season and has already made 31 appearances for the Rossoneri in the ongoing campaign. The 21-year-old right-back came up against Osimhen for the first time in Milan’s 1-0 win over Napoli on match-day 28 of the Serie A at the Diego Maradona Stadium in March. It was a fierce battle between the two players during the thrilling encounter in Naples, with the Frenchman coming out tops. Having made a total of 40 senior appearances both for club and country, Kalulu was of the opinion that Napoli’s talisman Osimhen was the most difficult opponent he had come up against. “The most difficult attacker to mark? Victor Osimhen,” Kalulu was quoted as saying by Napoli Magazine. “He is a forward who comes at you as if he is a defender. He always has desire. “I played against some strikers who go deep, but not as well as him because he believes in his speed. “You must always be concentrated. When we played, it was a good physical duel. He is a really good striker, really, really strong.” Despite being plagued by injuries this season, Osimhen has been impressive for Napoli and has been involved in 16 goals (12 goals and four assists) in 21 appearances.
