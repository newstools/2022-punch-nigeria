A Federal High Court sitting in Umuahia on Wednesday adjourned the case between Indigenous People of Biafra’s leader, Nnamdi Kanu, and the Federal Government, and others to May 12, 2022, for adoption of written addresses. Kanu had, on March 25, 2022, through his counsel, Aloy Ejimakor, approached the court to enforce his fundamental rights against unlawful expulsion and payment of N25bn damages. The presiding judge, Justice Evelyn Anyadike, had earlier adjourned the matter to April 27, 2022, to determine if the respondents defaulted by not appearing based on territorial jurisdiction. At the resumed hearing on Wednesday, Justice Anyadike  adjourned the matter to May 12, 2022, to enable the defence counsel to file their written addresses on the issue of territorial jurisdiction. Ejimakor later expressed his displeasure over the inability of the defence to file its written addresses. Counsel to the Federal Government, Simon Enoch, said he did not receive the addresses in good time, adding that “the court, in its wisdom, gave us up to May 12 to file the addresses.”  Copyright PUNCH.
