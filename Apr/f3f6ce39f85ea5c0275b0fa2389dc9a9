THE President of the Eti-Oni Development Group, Angelique-Monet, has said the Nigerian Cocoa Awards is set to create awareness about the economic value of cocoa and its value chain opportunities. This was disclosed during a press conference in Lagos to herald the Eko Chocolate Show and Royal Cocoa Film Festivals. According to her, the Central Bank of Nigeria has added cocoa to its priority non-oil export product, and several intervention initiatives have since been created to enhance access to affordable and long-term finance for cocoa development projects from production to value addition. She said, “The awareness has improved the cocoa culture being created, leading to many entrepreneurs going into chocolate making in Nigeria and across Africa now adding value to our cocoa and creating local wealth from it rather than depend on it being exported only as a raw material with the least possible value derived from it.” Speaking on the Royal Cocoa International Film Festivals, Angelique-Monet said it was the film festival founded by a reigning monarch and the only film festival in Nigeria hosting two major festivals yearly. She added that the festival was co-founded by her and the Oloni of Eti-Oni, Oba Dokun Gureje IV, to celebrate cocoa farmers. The Eko Chocolate Show 2022 is themed, ‘Celebrating Women in Cocoa,’ and will have the First Lady of Kwara State, Dr Olufolake Abdulrazaq, as its Special Guest of Honour while the Founder and Chief Executive Officer, of Temple Productions, Mrs Nwakaego Boyo, will be the Special Guest Speaker.
