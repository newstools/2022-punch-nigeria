Terrorists have killed 17 people in attacks on Geidam Local Government Area of Yobe State, sources said Thursday. Around two dozen fighters dressed in military-like uniforms and believed to be from the Islamic State West Africa Province group sneaked on foot into Geidam town late on Wednesday, militia sources said. “They rounded up nine people in a bar and slaughtered them, some with their hands tied behind their back,” militiaman Gremah Bukar told AFP. “They killed nine people at the bar, including two women and a retired police officer,” he said. The jihadists also forced their way into the staff living quarters of a technical college, killing two people and torching buildings, said Bukar, in an account supported by another militiaman, Abubakar Adamu. Residents who saw the attackers mistook them for troops from a base in the town, said resident Babagana Kyari. Ari Sanda, another resident, said the jihadists came through the eastern part of the town which had been left unguarded and people who saw them leave thought they were bonafide troops. Both residents gave the same death toll. Geidam, close to the Niger border, has been repeatedly raided by the jihadists, including the military base where they killed troops and carted away weapons.
