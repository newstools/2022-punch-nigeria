Gunmen suspected to be cultists have shot dead two persons returning from the farm in Obelle community in Emuoha Local Government Area of Rivers State. Though details of the incident were sketchy, a chief in the community, who confirmed the killings, said it happened on Friday. The source, a former acting Chairman of Community Development Committe in Obelle, Chief Isreal Anele, told newsmen that the incident took place along a farm road. Anele further said the killing caused panic in the community as some natives were temporarily fleeing to safer areas. “We don’t know where those people (gunmen) came from. So, the two were killed yesterday (Friday) along the farm road. So people are in panic and leaving the community a second time. But now we are seeing security operatives in the community,” Aneke stated. The acting spokesman of the state police command, Grace Iringe-Koko could not be reached as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
