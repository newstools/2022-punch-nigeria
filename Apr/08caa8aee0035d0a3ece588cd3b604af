No fewer than two persons have reportedly died when a training aircraft belonging to the Nigerian Air Force crashed in Kaduna on Tuesday evening. It was gathered that a student pilot and an instructor who were on board died in the crash. A source told our correspondent that the pilot and the instructor were having a training session when the aircraft crashed at the NAF Base in Kaduna. Efforts to get the NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Cdre Edward Gabkwet, were not successful. He has yet to respond to a message sent to him on the matter as of the time of filing this report. The crash occurred about 11 months after the last one. In May 2021, a military Beachcraft 350 aircraft crashed at the Kaduna International Airport, claiming all 11 persons on board, including the then Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru. On February 21, 2021, seven NAF officers died on board a Beechcraft KingAir B350i aircraft when the jet crashed in Abuja. Also, on March 31, 2021, NAF spokesman, Gabkwet, said an Alpha-Jet aircraft involved in the anti-terror war against Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province lost radar contact in Borno State. The aircraft was later declared crashed. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
