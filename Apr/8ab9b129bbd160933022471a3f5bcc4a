The traditional ruler of the Ogbeke Agbani in Nkanu West Local Government Area of Enugu State, Igwe Okechukwu Egbuna, has rescinded the ban placed on the burial of his late brother’s wife, Mrs. Elizabeth Ogbodo, after The PUNCH report. The PUNCH Metro had reported that Okechukwu banned the burial of the late widow, who died three months ago, following the refusal of her children to withdraw a lawsuit she instituted against some members of the community challenging creating access road inside her landed property. The monarch accused the deceased of contravening the community law by reporting a member of the community one Mr. Chizoba Ani to a women’s organisation, Women’s Aid Collective, and subsequently, taking him to court over a land matter. The monarch subsequently, after her death, placed an embargo on her burial threatening the immediate family with banishment from the community and a fine of N10,000 on any community member who would attend the burial which the children had fixed for Thursday, April 28, 2022, unless the court case was withdrawn. However, after The PUNCH report, the traditional ruler reportedly rescinded the ban and subsequently mandated the community members to attend the burial. Daughter of the late widow, Chiamaka Egbuna, who called our correspondent on the telephone on Wednesday to commend The PUNCH newspapers for coming to their aid through the report, said he had rescinded the decision. She said, “My family is very grateful to The PUNCH newspapers for coming to save us. You know what after your report, he (Igwe) summoned a meeting on Tuesday evening where he directed members of the community to ensure that everyone attends the burial on Thursday.” Copyright PUNCH.
