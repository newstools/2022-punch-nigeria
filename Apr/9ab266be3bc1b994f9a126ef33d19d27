The Vice President, Prof.Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) has described the late Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, as an exceptionally brilliant monarch whose brilliance and sound knowledge of many issues will be missed by many people. Osinbajo said being a monarch was what hid Oba Adeyemi, who he described as one of the best minds, from being recognised. The Vice President, who said this in Oyo on Friday during a condolence visit to the palace, said Oba Adeyemi, although not a professor but no professor could push him aside when discussing issues. He said he knew the late monarch long before he became the Vice President and added that Alaafin could argue cases despite not being a lawyer. Osinabjo said, “I bring special condolence on behalf of the President, Major General Mujammadu Buhari (retd). Kabiyesi impacted everyone and impacted the President himself as the President recalls two occasions when Alaafin interacted with him in recent times and has good memories of him. Also, he says that he believes he was one of the frontline men he has ever met. “He (Alaafin) could argue even though he wasn’t a lawyer but was very knowledgeable. He was an exceptional man. He took Yoruba race seriously and always wanted the best for Yoruba till he died. Whenever he came to Abuja, he was concerned about how Nigeria, and  most especially Yoruba land would be better. “Kabiyesi was in the mould of a philosopher king. He understood the place of the correct representation of the history, heritage and political economy of a people in imbuing self-worth and self-esteem in the people and by such means, the building of a proud and patriotic people.” Copyright PUNCH.
