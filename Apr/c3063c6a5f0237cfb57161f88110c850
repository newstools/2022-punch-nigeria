One of the presidential aspirants of the Peoples Democratic Party  and former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, has said the consensus arrangement being promulgated by some aspirants was not what Nigeria needs at the present time, adding that the country needs someone that would work to rescue the country to get out of its challenges as the next president. He also said Nigerians should not allow the All Progressive Congress government to continue, stating the government has drawn the country backward. Obi stated this while speaking at a meeting with chieftains of the PDP in Ondo State, at the party secretariat in Akure, the state capital, on Sunday, ahead the forthcoming primaries of the party. He said, “The children can no longer eat, we are at high level of misery, we cannot allow them to continue. “If nothing is done to Nigeria’s problem, it will consume all of us. It will consume our children too. “We must not talk about the consensus now, we must talk about who will work. Nigerians want consensus that will solve the Nigerian problem. “We want someone that will take Nigeria from consumption to production level. We must elect somebody that can do the work. We are not talking about who will become the next president of Nigeria but who will start working for this country called Nigeria.” In his remarks, a leader of the PDP in Ondo and former governor of the state , Olusegun Mimiko, said the PDP was lucky to have competent and credible persons as aspirants to contest for the post of president.
