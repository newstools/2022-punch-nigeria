The Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, has said he is still consulting on whether or not he will join the presidential race. He added that he would make public his decision after Easter. Ngige, a member of the All Progressives Congress, in an interview with our correspondent in Abuja, said, “I’m still consulting and will make the decision arising from it public after Lent which is Easter period.” Pressure groups and prominent voices in the country have called on the two major political parties, the Peoples Democratic Party and the APC, to micro-zone the 2023 presidency to the South-East. Foremost activist and convener, Concerned Nigerians, Deji Adeyanju, in an open letter to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari, said, “Since General Aguiyi Ironsi’s unfortunate demise in 1966, no person of South-East extraction has governed Nigeria. Sadly, this undeniable and systematic exclusion has created a largely subconscious and increasingly permanent feeling of disenchantment amongst the Igbo.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
