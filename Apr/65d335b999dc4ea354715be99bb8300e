Nollywood actress, Nkechi Blessing Sunday, on Monday said that she was never afraid to fall in love. In an Instagram post, the actress encouraged her fans not to give up on love as she described love as a “beautiful thing.” Nkechi noted that it was easier to fall in love when one practises self-love. She wrote, “Regardless of what goes down, amidst plenty of chaos, do not forget LOVE is a beautiful thing. “I have soo much love in me that I am never afraid to fall in love because the moment you love yourself more, it becomes easy to fall in love and be loved. Never ever give up on LOVE.” This comes weeks after the actress was involved in a messy breakup with her ex-lover, Opeyemi Falegan, as the duo attacked each other on social media. Speaking to The PUNCH on the cause of their break up, Nkechi had said, “Nothing caused it. It did not just work. We just went our separate ways. It was a fact that I was the one taking care of him. Everyone that lives in London knows that.” However, many have lambasted the actress for the messy social media drama, considering she had said just weeks earlier that she would not drag her partner on social media if the relationship ended.
