The operation which took the combined efforts of vigilantes from Ochadamu and Ejule was on the heels of continued efforts by the state government to rid the state of all forms of criminality and their various sponsors. Confirming the arrest, the State Security Adviser to the Governor of Kogi State, Commander Jerry Omodara (retd.), stressed that the arrest was the result of Governor Yahaya Bello’s marching order to Local Government Chairmen and respective stakeholders on the need to secure their respective locality. Omodara said that the governor last week gave an order to security agencies, including local vigilantes in the state to put an end to the activities of kidnappers and armed robbers along Ajaokuta-Itobe-Ochadamu-Ejule-Anyigba with immediate effect. He said within six days of the operation not fewer than 8 ring leaders have been apprehended. He praised all the security agencies in the state for their commitment, support and dedication to ridding the state of insecurity. “In the last six days, eight notorious kidnappers and highways robbery gangs have been arrested in this part of the state and the government is determined to root out criminals from the caves and valleys within the state,” Omodara stated. The governor’s aide asserted that the government remained relentless in ensuring that every nook and cranny of the state was effectively secured and safe for citizens adding that the government would continue to give the needed support to various security outfits to sustain their highly commendable success stories.
