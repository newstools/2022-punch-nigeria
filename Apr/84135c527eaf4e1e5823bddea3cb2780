Singer, Habeeb Okikiola, popularly known as Portable, has knocked his former promoter, Quadri Taoreed, aka Kogbagidi, for his alleged refusal to process a trip for him to the United Kingdom. The PUNCH reports that popular socialite and businessman, Emeka ‘E-Money’ Okonkwo, sponsored Portable to the United Kingdom. After arriving in the UK, Portable took to his Instagram page to share photos and videos of himself and the socialite at the airport. The Zazuu crooner also revealed that he’ll be performing in three cities, while in the UK. But in a tweet on his Twitter handle on Friday, the singer berated his former promoter for his failure to ensure a London trip come to fruition while their business relationship lasted. “Kogbagidi refuse to take me to London but look who is here today,” Portable wrote as a caption to a photo of himself on a London street on Friday.  The PUNCH reports that in a video that went viral on social media on Thursday, January 6, 2022, Portable accused Kogbagidi of taking the SUV he was recently gifted by a fan. The singer who wielded a baseball bat could be heard at the top of his voice asking Kogbagidi to return the car, while also alleging that he had ‘settled’ him on several occasions by giving him money on different occasions. He said, “I gave you $500 and N500,000 twice. You have ripped me off. You know that you are a ripper.” Portable became a sensation after his hit single titled, ‘Zazu Zeh’, on which he featured rapper, Olamide Adedeji, aka Baddo, and popular dancer, Iwe Pascal, popularly known as Poco Lee, went viral on social media.
