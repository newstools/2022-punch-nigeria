A group under the aegis of “Team Alimikhena” has advised former Governor of Edo state, Adams Oshiomhole to join the Presidential race and not engage in a battle of wits with Senator Francis Alimikhena over a Senatorial seat. The group handed down this advice in a signed press statement by the convener, Mr Sunny Ifijen, and Secretary, Omeiza Ogumah. They urged the former governor not to be carried away with the endorsements by people they described as “selfish”. Team Alimikhena also warned that those encouraging Oshiomole to run for Senate are not only pursuing their personal interest, but also want to place a wedge in the harmonious relationship that Oshiomhole and Alimikhena have enjoyed over the years The statement read in part, “If those dragging Oshiomhole to seek for the Edo North senate seat are genuinely concerned about the progress of Oshiomhole, they should have advised him to join the Presidential race which has practically been zoned to the South.
