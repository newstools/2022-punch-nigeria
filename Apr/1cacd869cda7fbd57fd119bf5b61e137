A member of the All Progressives Congress in the Ondo West Local Government Area, Segun Akinwande, said the Ondo West Constituency 1 deserved better representation as the 2023 general election draws nearer. He also stated that the state constituency needed a person with the required level of competence, selflessness, and compassion who will do all it takes to protect the interest of the people at the state level. Akinwande stated this at the APC Secretariat, Ondo Town, Ondo State, when he declared his intention to contest the House of Assembly election in the state. He said, ” I am determined to give the kind of representation that will improve the living standards of the people and I will facilitate job opportunities for the youths and soft loans to boost the businesses of women in the constituency, if elected.” When asked about the astronomical increase in the price of party forms, which has discouraged many youths from vying for political positions, he explained that every party had its principles which members must key into and that the APC was no exemption. “Every party has its way of doing things and when the party has come up with the fee, every member has no option than to key into it, ” he stated.
