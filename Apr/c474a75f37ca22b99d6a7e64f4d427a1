There were reports on Saturday that terrorists in large numbers invaded Agban Kagoro in Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna State and killed two people while scores sustained injuries. The PUNCH had reported that terrorists attacked the town on March 20, leading to the death of no fewer than 34 people including two military personnel. Seven persons were injured and over 200 houses and 32 shops burnt, according to the state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan. The government thereafter slammed a 24-hour curfew on two neighbouring local governments of Jema’a and Kaura. The state and the police command had yet to confirm the latest attack as of press time. When contacted on the telephone, the Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammad Jalige, promised to get in touch with the Area Commander and get back to our correspondent. He had yet to do so as of press time. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
