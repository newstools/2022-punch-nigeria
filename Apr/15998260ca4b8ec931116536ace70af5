Amid growing concerns over the risk of flooding in the rainy season, the Ogun State Government has warned residents against the indiscriminate dumping of refuse in drainage channels, waterways, and roadsides across the state. It said defaulters would face severe sanctions under the state’s environmental laws. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Environment, Mr Ola Oresanya, who gave the warning while monitoring the monthly environmental sanitation exercise in the Ifo Local Government Area of the state, said it became necessary due to the environmental impact of illicit refuse dumping on the well-being of the citizens. Oresanya lamented that a few individuals had turned roadsides into their dumpsites despite several appeals to them to embrace the appropriate waste management process. According to him, the dumping of refuse in public places not only exposes them to flooding but also destroys road infrastructure. He, however, said the state government would not fold its hands and allow the gains of its waste management reforms to be eroded by a “few recalcitrant individuals” who put the life of the larger society at risk with their bad habits. “Ogun State residents are clean people; so, these few must ship in or face sanctions. Instead of using its scarce resources on other infrastructure, the government will be forced to reconstruct the damaged roads,” Oresanya added. The governor’s aide, therefore, urged the residents to subscribe to the waste management reforms of the state government by patronising waste private sector participants assigned to their areas for proper collection and disposal of their wastes.
