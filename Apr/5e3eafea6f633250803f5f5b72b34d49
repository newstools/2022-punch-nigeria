The Lagos State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, on Wednesday, screened aspirants for the Senate, Federal House of Representatives and the State House of Assembly. The screening of aspirants for Senate and Federal House of Representatives was held at Regency Hotel, GRA, Ikeja, Lagos, while the screening of aspirants for the State House of Assembly was held at White House Hotel, GRA, Ikeja, Lagos. A statement signed by the Lagos State Publicity Secretary of the party, Hakeem Amode, dated April 19, 2022, showed that aspirants for Senate were asked to pay an administrative fee of N350,000 while those aspiring for the Federal House of Representatives were charged N200,000. Aspirants for the State House of Assembly were asked to pay N50,000 while those aspiring to be governor of the State were charged N500,000. The aspirants who arrived at the venues as early as 9am were asked to provide proof of payment of the administrative fee charged by the party, which they did. This was despite a warning by former Deputy National Chairman of the party, Chief Olabode George, against such payment. In a statement he personally signed, George said, “I hereby warn all our aspirants to be vigilant and not to pay any illegal fees. The act of extortion being embarked upon by the Lagos Exco should be shunned and ignored. “I equally warn the Exco not to extort our party members. They are to pay only fees that are legal.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
