Super Eagles striker, Odion Ighalo, says his aim is to keep scoring goals and helping his team win every game,” PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The Nigeria international, who currently plies his trade in Saudi Arabia, has been in terrific form since moving to the Gulf, scoring 25 goals in 32 appearances across all competitions for Al Shabab and Al Hilal. He is Nigeria’s top scorer home and abroad this season, ahead of Paul Onuachu, Taiwo Awoniyi, Victor Osimhen, Cyriel Dessers, Sodiq Umar, amongst others. The 32-year-old noted that he had surprised himself with the number of goals he’s scored this season, adding that as a striker he hoped to continue churning in the goals on a regular basis. “The number of goals I’ve scored? I didn’t see it coming but as a striker, you always hope to score goals and I’m happy the goals are coming and I don’t want to stop. I want to keep working hard, helping my team win games and keep scoring goals,” Ighalo told PUNCH Sports Extra. “For me I just do my best anywhere I go. Everywhere I play in my career I have always given my best and that’s the same thing I’m doing in Saudi Arabia, trying to help my team score goals to win games.”  Copyright PUNCH.
