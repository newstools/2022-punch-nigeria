The Rivers State Police Command has arrested two members of an armed robbery syndicate that specialise in dispossessing unsuspecting drivers of their tricycles. The state acting police spokesperson, Grace Iringe-Koko, disclosed this in a statement issued in Port Harcourt on Sunday. Iringe-Koko identified the suspects as Steve Green, 38, and Adaugo Darlington, a female who usually pretends to be pregnant to attract sympathy. The suspects pose as passengers, attack the drivers with knives and machetes and push them down while still in motion. The statement read, “The syndicate however ran out of luck on March 31, 2022, along Rumunduru  Eneka in Obio / Akpor  Local Government Area when police operatives of Eneka Division, while on routine patrol, got to the scene where their last victim, one Lasisi Akeem, was dispossessed of his tricycle. “The victim, who had machete cuts, was able to describe his tricycle and the suspects. The officers immediately chased and apprehended two of the suspects, and recovered the tricycle. “Meanwhile, the victim was rushed to the hospital for medical treatment while efforts are on to nab the two others who escaped.  Investigation has commenced.” In a related development, policemen attached to Etche Local Government Area, acting on credible intelligence, raided a criminal hideout at Okehi Etche, where they arrested two male suspects. The police spokesperson gave their names as Njoku Chimanya, 19, and Chijioke Umesurum, 20. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
