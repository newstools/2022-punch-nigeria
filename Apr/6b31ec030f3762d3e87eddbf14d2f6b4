The Kano State Commissioner for Rural Development, Musa Kwankwaso, has resigned. His resignation comes hours after Governor Abdullahi Ganduje gave Kano State political appointees wishing to run for elective offices 24 hours to resign. In an audio clip, Kwankwaso thanked Ganduje for the opportunity given him to serve the state. Recall that Ganduje had in a statement on Sunday ordered all political appointees wishing to contest for elections to resign from their respective appointments. The directive was in compliance with the provision of section 84(12) of the newly amended Electoral Act. Ganduje’s commissioner for Water Resources, Sadiq Wali, had earlier resigned and obtained the governorship nomination form on the platform of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party.(End).
