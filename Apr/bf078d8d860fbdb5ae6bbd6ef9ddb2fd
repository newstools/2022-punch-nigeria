A medical expert and candidate of the Action Democratic Congress in Ekiti State, Dr Oluwole Oluyede, has said the state has no excuse not to harness its vast available resources to develop the land and people. Oluyede said the forward-looking government, which the ADC would provide in the state, would “create multiple ingenious means that will generate resources for the growth and development of the state and deemphasize reliance on monthly federal allocations.” The Australia-based medical practitioner, who spoke in Ado Ekiti, stated, “The debt profile of Ekiti State in the last one decade is worrisome. This is because of the inability of successive governments to think outside the box and take advantage of various opportunities around the state. “Many developing and developed countries in Europe do not have abundance of resources that God has blessed Ekiti with. The difference is that their leaders make good use of the available resources at their disposal. “The current practice of outright dependence on monthly allocations will only limit the growth of the state and make it subservient. We will change the situation to move the state forward and change its economic fortunes.” On the June 18 election, the ADC flag bearer expressed confidence that his party would emerge victorious, saying, “Ekiti people have decided to go a new way that will give them better opportunities.” He dispelled the insinuation that he was planning to step down, saying, “I am in the game to win and nothing more.”  Copyright PUNCH.
