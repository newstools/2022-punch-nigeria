The Katsina State Police Command has commenced investigation into the circumstances surrounding the murder of a trader, Sale Auta, at the Gidan Daudu village in the Kankara Local Government Area of the state by gunmen suspected to be terrorists. The spokesman for the Command, Gambo Isah, confirmed the development on Thursday. According to him, Auta was killed by gunmen on Tuesday. Isah stated, “The man was killed by gunmen on Tuesday night and we have launched investigation into the incident as various reasons are being postulated for the dastardly act. I cannot say much for now until we complete our investigation.” Residents said gunmen killed Auta during an attack on the Gidan Daudu village. It was learnt that the gunmen also abducted Auta’s daughter, known as Aisha, after they had killed him. Auta was said to be in the company of his family and friends in his residence when the gunmen operating on motorcycles stormed the village and singled him out. He was dragged outside the residence before they shot and killed him. The residents equally alleged that an unspecified number of people were also abducted and whisked away into the forest by the gunmen. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
