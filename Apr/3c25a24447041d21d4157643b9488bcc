An Ogun mother, Taiwo Tijani, narrates her side of the story as to how her daughter, Mary, was set ablaze. She also denied setting her child ablaze, laying the blame on cooking gas. Tijani pleaded to be let go so she can take care of her ailing daughter in the hospital, given the father’s inability to stay with her at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital. She said she would serve whatever punishment to be placed on her after her daughter has healed.
