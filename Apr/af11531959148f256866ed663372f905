A leading agro-allied and chemical company, Notore Chemical Industries, has reported an operating income of N9.9bn in its audited results for 15 months ended 31st December 2021. In a statement by its Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Mr Ohis Ohiwerei, the company said the period was for rebuilding and repositioning Notore to further deliver on its promise to champion the African Green Revolution. The statement quoted him as saying, “Though a very challenging period for Notore, it completed the TAM programme during the period. TAM was a critical step taken by the Company to address the drawbacks affecting the stability and reliability of its manufacturing plant, an essential measure to raise production output to meet and sustain its plant’s 500,000 MT per annum nameplate design capacity.” He noted that the company had taken steps to diversify its revenue streams further, stressing that the production of its Notore NPK blend of fertilisers had continued to rise in output and sales, with increases expected in the ongoing future periods. He stated, “By leveraging on its installed 2,000 metric tons per day NPK blending capacity, and its successful introduction of the Notore NPK brand of fertilisers, the Company is well-positioned for significant growth in revenues and cash flows in the ongoing future.” Ohiwerei said Notore had taken the steps in its bid to improve working capital and return to profitability, stating that the company was in discussion with its bankers for a further restructuring of a substantial part of the its short-term loans into fixed long-term loans.
