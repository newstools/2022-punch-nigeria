A group, the Arewa Alliance for the Presidency of Godwin Emefiele, said it has secured the endorsement of the North-East region for the yet-to-be-declared presidential aspiration of the Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele. The group in a statement on Sunday by its National Convener, Dauda Kushu, disclosed that stakeholders in the North-East endorsed Emefiele at a well-attended town hall meeting held in Yola, Adamawa State. According to Kushu, those who endorsed Emefiele’s ambition includethe North-East business community, North-East All Progressives Youth Leaders, North-East APC Women Leaders and North-East APC stakeholders. The statement said, “Before the event, AAPGE had met with all the 21 local government APC party chairmen in Adamawa State and other party executives, who also warmly received the proposition of an Emefiele presidency. “Speaking during the event, AAPGE leaders stated that the group’s activities in support of Godwin Emefiele are as a result of their confidence in him and his acceptability among all Nigerians brought about by his unbiased, people-focused interventions at the CBN.” The group pointed out that before Emefiele was appointed the CBN Governor, less privileged Nigerians had not felt the impact of the government. However, with Emefiele’s interventions and policies, the group claimed that the lives of millions of Nigerians have been significantly improved. Lauding the CBN’s agricultural transformation efforts, AAPGE noted that “Emefiele has abolished Nigeria’s status as a food-dependent nation and turned it into a food self-sufficient nation,” adding that if Emefiele was allowed to emerge as the President, “Nigeria will be the better for it.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
