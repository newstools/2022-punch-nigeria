Isiekwene Christian, interim head coach of the Nigeria Professional Football League side, MFM says their game against Abia Warriors on Saturday (today) at the Umuahia Township Stadium is a must-win as they continue their fight to survive relegation, Sunday PUNCH reports. The Olukoya Boys are currently languishing at the bottom of the NPFL sitting in 20th position with 23 points, the same points as Kano Pillars who occupy the 19th position. MFM lost their last home match against Wikki Tourists on Thursday and will hope to return to winning ways when they travel to Abia to take on the Warriors, who currently sit 14th on the log. Speaking with PUNCH Sports Extra, Christian, who took over after the club’s coaching crew were relieved of their jobs following poor results, said winning every game is their primary target as they continue to fight for safety. “There is nothing short that victory at the moment because we are not expected to lose any game,” MFM coach told Sunday PUNCH. “We just need to go for the result and there is every possibility that MFM will survive the relegation because we are working that to ensure that happens.” A win for the Olukoya Boys could see them move to 16 on the NPFL log, a move away from the drop for the first time this season.
