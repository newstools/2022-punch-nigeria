The Enugu State chapter of the Amaechi Polling Unit Vanguard has described the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, as a leader groomed to deliver Nigeria. Secretary of APUV in Enugu, Tony Alum, disclosed this during the swearing-in ceremony of the state executives of the group on Saturday. The group said with their grassroots network, they would be able to secure enough delegates’ votes for him from Enugu State. He described Amaechi as “Mr Democracy or Mr Fortune”, stating that he remained one of the few Nigerians who had consistently held important political positions in the 24 years of the fourth Republic. Alum noted that the ultimate goal of politics was the gathering of votes, adding that polling booths were goalposts, hence the reason the founding fathers of their party did not joke with polling booths. Going down memory lane, Alum noted that Amaechi had held positions of a speaker, governor, and now minister, pointing out that his ministry was one of the few ministries the government boasts with. He said, “His ministry has started and completed many projects. The victories are neither by accident nor coincidence. Events have shown that Amaechi can only succeed because that is the only thing he knows how to do. “We should count ourselves lucky to be among the vanguard that will work for the success of this child of destiny who has been groomed for the deliverance of Nigeria.”
