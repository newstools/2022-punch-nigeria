The National Insurance Commission has approved the local passengers’ flight welfare scheme for Anchor Insurance Company Limited for deployment into the market in 2022. Anchor Insurance said it was determined to expand its retail market and subsequently increase premium earnings and deepen penetration. A statement signed by the company’s Managing Director, Mr Ebose Augustine, said the scheme would be operated with its existing general insurance products. In its approval letter to the company, NAICOM stated that “In exercise of the powers conferred on the commission by Insurance Act 2003, your company is hereby granted a ‘No objection’ to introduce your product tagged ‘Local Passengers’ Flight Welfare Scheme’ to the Nigerian insurance market.” According to the managing director, the company saw this approval as another opportunity to make the Nigerian local flight passengers enjoy more peace of mind. He urged the local flight operators to see this insurance product as a value-added package that would endear them to their well-valued passengers. “We thrive in providing our clients with top quality insurance care through our friendly and experienced professionals, timely claim administration, customer-friendly products and super customer experience delivery,” Ebose said.
