Residents living in the Taraba State University-New Central Bank Bypass Road in Jalingo, the Taraba State capital, on Friday counted their losses following a downpour that lasted for several hours. A Superintendent of Police, Moses Agondo, who was also affected by the flood, told our correspondent that he woke up at about 1am and found himself submerged in water. Agondo explained that the water which forced its way into his room woke him up. “The water level in my house was above the window level when I woke up. I tried to open the door, but the wave of the water was too strong, so I forced the window protector open and I fled to safety. I thank God for saving my life. It would have been more disastrous if I had insisted on opening the room door. “The water went away with my clothes, including my uniform and the cash I had on me. It’s a lecturer at the university who gave clothes to wear. I lost everything to the flood. All my electronics and personal belongings worth thousands of naira have been destroyed by the flood. Another resident, Mrs Abisha Yusuf, said she narrowly escaped death with her two children who were asleep when the incident happened. She noted that her belongings were destroyed. Yusuf appealed to the state government and well-meaning individuals to come to the aid of those affected by the flood.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
