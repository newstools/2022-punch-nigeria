The spokesperson for the police in the state, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, in a statement on Friday, said the suspects were arrested on Mojirade Street in the Shibiri area of the state. Hundeyin said though the suspects were arrested following a tip-off by members of the public for robbery and murder, they were being investigated over the death of the sergeant. According to him, a silver-coloured Sienna bus, with registration number LSR 509 HB; a locally made double-barrel pistol, four live cartridges, one machete, one knife, two screwdrivers and 12 mobile phones were recovered from them. Others were one Access Bank ATM card with the name, Newton Newman, some substances suspected to be Indian hemp and one dead snail. The statement added, “The prompt arrest of the suspects followed a tip-off from Lagos residents to the Divisional Police Officer of Ilemba Hausa Division, who led his men to the criminals’ hideout where seven members of the gang were arrested while others escaped. The Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi, has directed that the suspects and exhibits be transferred to the command’s headquarters for further investigation and arrest of other members of the gang.”  Copyright PUNCH.
