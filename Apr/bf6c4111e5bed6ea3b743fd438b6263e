Actress and participant in the ongoing reality television show, Real Housewives of Lagos, Iyabo Ojo, has said criticisms and abuses from rape apologists don’t get to her. Speaking on Friday, April 22, 2022, in a Zoom interview, she stated that she had no regrets going against another actor, Baba Ijesha, at the height of his child molestation saga. Responding to a question on how people would react to her on the show after her involvement in the case, the actress said, “That is the price one has to pay. Nobody can project anything negative on me. I have built a wall around me. Some people have attacked me on social media and they now understand where I am coming from. If I get bashed by a rape apologist, it doesn’t get to me. I am not going to stop being me.” Ojo also denied that she was trying to show off while she hosted the other ‘housewives’ on the show. She said, “I did not try to show off with hosting the other ladies. It was just me doing my thing. It was not as if I brought my cars (there). We were the only ones at the beach house (where the event took place). I just decided to spice things up. I am only cool with Mariam Timmer, Toyin Lawani, and Chioma Goodhair. I am not enemies with the others but one cannot be friends with everyone. “It is very easy for me to relate with other women. If you are good to me, I would be good to you. If you bring bad energy, I will also respond with bad energy.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
