Actress, Halima Abubakar, says though she used to be a stubborn and emotional person, she is now calm and classy. She told Sunday Scoop, “Change is inevitable. I used to be very stubborn and emotional. (However), I don’t make excuses for my behaviour. Now, I have changed. I am very calm and classy now. I am mature in my thoughts and approach to life. I do not put my mouth or go to places where I am not needed. I am very loyal.” The actress also insisted that women should wash their used sanitary pads before disposing of them. She said, “I have a pet project on hygiene. I have been talking about hygiene for the past 15 years, so I wonder why my statement surprised people. Till date, there are some ladies who wash blood from the pads they use. Some even burn it. There are people who pick used pads for rituals. That was why I suggested that people should wash blood off their pads or throw it into a pit.” On why she has not been frequent in movies in recent times, Abubakar said, “I took a break. Can I rest? I am a filmmaker and I can produce anytime I want. I have done over 100 movies. A lot of things have happened in the last three years. Two of my movies were in the cinemas last year (2021). This year, I already have one movie in the cinema. I am a business woman right now, and I run two stores. Nollywood will always be there.” Speaking on her experience as a mother, she said, “My experience as a mother has been amazing. I love children and I have so many adopted children in orphanages. In the past 10 years, I have been taking care of these kids through my foundation. I did not bring the children into my house though; they are in the orphanage. I just call them my children.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
