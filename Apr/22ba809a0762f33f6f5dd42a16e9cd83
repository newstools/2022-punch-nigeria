Kano State Hisbah Board, on Saturday, confirmed that it recorded a huge success in the fight against prostitution, drug abuse, and other societal vices during the month of Ramadan. The feat, the board said, followed the impoundment of 250 cartons of beer and other intoxicants by the Sharia police. The Commander-General of the Agency, Sheikh Dr Harun Ibn Sina, made the disclosure while inspecting two vehicles loaded with assorted beer consignment, including other intoxicants, which identity was concealed, so as to facilitate easy passage into the state. Also, Ibn Sina stated that the agency had intensified campaigns and advocacy visits to enlighten the general public about the dangers of engaging in immoral activities. He commended the head of the Anti-intoxicants unit and his team for their relentless efforts in scuttling the distribution of beer and other harmful drugs in the state. Earlier, the head of the Anti-intoxicants unit, Jamilu Yakasai, said they successfully arrested 12 vehicles suspected to be used in smuggling beer into Kano during the holy month of Ramadan. He disclosed that over 250 cartons of the impounded beer are in their custody. Yakasai emphasized that the unit would not relent in its efforts to stamp out beer consumption in Kano. Sina maintained that the intoxicants were carefully packaged to conceal their detection. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
