The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), Friday in Abuja urged the Muslim Ummah nationwide to seek greater personal discipline, which is necessary for the realisation of a great nation. According to a statement signed late Friday by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari said the period offers a unique opportunity to “feel the hunger experienced by the poor so as to feel what it is like to be deprived and marginalised.” The statement is titled ‘President Buhari welcomes Ramadan fasting, asks Muslims to feed the poor.’ According to him, “Muslims should seek greater personal discipline, which is necessary for the realisation of a great nation.” He advised the Muslim elite against food waste and extravagant spending while others face hunger and destitution, urging that they should care for their neighbours, the poor and the marginalised. Buhari also called for prayers for peace in the country and beyond, and for healing and harmony throughout the world. He, therefore, wished all Muslims a successful completion of the 30-day fasting period. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
