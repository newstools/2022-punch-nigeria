The Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria has said it is promoting insurance awareness by identifying and developing talents in the sector. The President, Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria, Dr. Muftau Oyegunle, spoke during the ‘CIIN Nite of Talents’ organised by the institute for the industry. The Nite of Talents’, he explained, is a remodel and departure from the former ‘Miss Insurance Pageantry’ programme. “The ‘Nite of Talents’ was created for the purpose of promoting insurance awareness, intellectual prowess and gender equality as it will showcase the intellectual capabilities of the next generation of insurance practitioners in the industry; and this will consequently help boost insurance adoption,” Oyegunle said. At the event which was well attended by stakeholders in the industry, he said the institute organised the quiz competition which was the highlight of the night and provided an opportunity for contestants from insurance companies to display their potential and compete for the crown. The winner in the contest aside from getting a notable prize, he said, would also function as the CIIN ambassador for insurance for a year and would be engaged in several programmes geared towards projecting the insurance industry and the CIIN to the world, he said.
