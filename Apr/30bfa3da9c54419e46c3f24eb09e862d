There was palpable fear in many motor parks in Osogbo, Osun State capital, on Saturday, as a result of alleged plans by the state Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, Olalekan Folorunso, to seek another term in office. At the Old Garage, Dugbe and Stadium parks, members of the union, who spoke to Sunday PUNCH, alleged that the national leadership of the NURTW had increased the annual ticket fee of each unit in the state from N15,000 to N60,000. They also accused both the state and national leadership of the union of increasing their daily ticket fee from N150 to N300, while calling on the state government to take over the motor parks and put them under a park management team as obtained in Ondo, Oyo and Ogun states. The rising tension in the union, it was learnt, made Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, to meet its members on Friday to seek an amicable resolution of the issues. The Chairman, Osogbo and Olorunda Local Government branch, NURTW, Kazeem Oyewale, said vehicles from Osun were no longer allowed to pick passengers in Lagos, Oyo, Ondo and Ogun states, because those states were operating the park management system. When contacted, Folorunso said he wouldn’t be the first to seek a third term in office, adding that a chairman in Osun once spent 24 years in office. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
