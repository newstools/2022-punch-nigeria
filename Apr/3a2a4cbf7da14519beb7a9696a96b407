Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State on Saturday said he was not scared of the former governor of Lagos State and national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo and other contenders in the race to get the ticket of the party for the 2023 presidency. He acknowledged that although Tinubu and other personalities were the founding members of the APC, Bello said the foundation of a house was not enough as there were other things to be put in place to build a house. Bello stated these in Abuja during his second annual seminar for political and crime correspondents, barely 24 hours after expressing optimism that he was most favoured to clinch the APC ticket for the presidency. Among the frontliners in the discourse around 2023 presidency were Tinubu, Osinbajo, among others. “To answer your question whether I am scared of other contestants for the presidency, I will say No; I am not scared of anybody in the contest for the APC presidential ticket. “Tinubu and others are founding members of the APC, but foundation is not enough. I will defeat all the other aspirants because I have all it takes to be a champion. My performance in Kogi State will speak for me,” he said. According to him, there are over 16 million Nigerians with Permanent Voter Cards already waiting to vote him in the 2023 election. Asked why he was always rooting for the younger generation, Bello said he believed that Nigeria can do more with younger persons in power. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
