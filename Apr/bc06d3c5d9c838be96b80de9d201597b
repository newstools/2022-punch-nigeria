A former Minister of Sports, Solomon Dalung, has dumped the All Progressives Congress. Dalung, who served as a minister under the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), submitted his letter of withdrawal from the APC to the Ward Chairman of the party in SabonGida Ward, Langtang South LGA of Plateau State. The letter dated April 1, 2022, and signed by the politician on April 18, 2022, was obtained by our Correspondent in Jos on Tuesday. Part of the letter read, “This is to convey my withdrawal of membership from the All Progressives Congress with effect from the date of this notice. “It is worthy of mention that recent developments in the party conflict with my core principles of values which define the basis of allegiance to the party. “Of note is the fact that internal democracy is critical to the survival of representative democracy without which political participation remains a mirage.” Copyright PUNCH.
