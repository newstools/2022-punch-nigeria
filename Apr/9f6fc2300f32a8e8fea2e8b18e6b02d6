Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, on Saturday declared his intention to contest the 2023 presidential election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress. He asked Nigerians to make informed decisions on who becomes the next president, as he warned against repeating past mistakes. The governor, who expressed his interest at an event at the Eagles Square in Abuja, named Hafsat Abiola-Costello, daughter of the winner of the annulled June 1993 presidential election, late Chief Moshood Abiola, as the Director-General of his presidential campaign organisation. The governor also named former Senate Deputy Leader, Jonathan Zwingina, as the national coordinator of his campaign organisation. Bello promised to create 20 million millionaires by the year 2030 using the South-East model of apprenticeship and that he would end the farmer-herder clashes. He said his youthfulness would enhance his performance, noting that he was physically and mentally fit to lead Nigeria to prosperity. He said he would apply a lot of empathy in governance in recruitment and distribution of resources if elected. He added, “The 2023 presidential election is actually a battle for the survival of Nigeria and I am passionate enough about my country to fight for the privilege. I gave Kogi state a better treatment.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
