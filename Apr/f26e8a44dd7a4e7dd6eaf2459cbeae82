Kano State Commissioner for Budget and Planning, Alhaji Nura Dankadai, on Wednesday, handed over the affairs of his ministry to the next in command despite Governor Abdullahi Ganduje’s rejection of his resignation letter. The PUNCH reports that Ganduje had earlier issued an ultimatum to political appointees wishing to contest in the 2023 general elections to resign on or before April 18 in line with the Electoral Act, 2022. Dankadai, who had indicated interest to contest a seat in the House of Representatives for the Tudun-Wada Federal Constituency, is unhappy with the directive for him to stay put following indications that the party will hand over the ticket in the constituency to House Majority Leader, Alhassan Doguwa, who is seeking re-election. He was said to have tendered his resignation letter on Monday, and was among the three commissioners, including the Chief of Staff, who Ganduje rejected their resignation, just like he did with the Managing Director of Kano Road Traffic Road Agency, Baffa Dan’agundi. Meanwhile, the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Usman Alhaji, has withdrawn from the governorship race. This is contained in a statement by Chairman, Patriotic Volunteers for Good Governance, Alhaji Dan’azumi Gwarzo, which was made available to The PUNCH on Wednesday. According to the statement, the decision to withdraw from the race followed a meeting between the governor, SSG and Gwarzo.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
