No fewer than two vehicles and buildings’ fences were destroyed following a rainstorm that uprooted trees in the aftermath of Sunday’s early morning rainfall in Lagos State. The incident happened in Muri Okunola Street, Victoria Island area of Lagos State. As gathered, no casualty was recorded when the uprooted trees destroyed the vehicles. The trees broke through the iron fence of one of the compounds and crushed cars parked on the other side of the fence. Confirming the incident after sharing pictures with our correspondent, a resident in the area said nobody was injured during the incident. He said, “It happened during the storm in the early morning. “No one injured that we know of. Looks like the driver of the grey Merc SUV was trying to maneuver out when the trees fell with side as the car is in the middle of the road and unscathed.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
