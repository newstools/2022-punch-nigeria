The Anambra State House of Assembly on Thursday, confirmed all the 20 commissioner-nominees presented by Governor Chukwuma Soludo. The confirmation followed the adoption of the report of the assembly screening committee at the plenary in Awka, on Thursday. Presenting the report, the Chairman of the Screening and Election Committee Matters, Mr Pascal Agbodike, said that the 20 nominees met the requirements needed to be members of the state executive council of the state. Agbodike, who is also the Deputy Speaker of the House, said they had all attained the mandatory age required for appointment as commissioners in the state and showed the ability to serve. Supporting the claim, Mr Emeka Aforka, representing the Orumba North constituency, urged his colleagues to support the motion to allow the governor to implement his developmental projects in the state. The lawmakers, thereafter, confirmed the nominees through a voice vote. In his remarks, the Speaker of the Assembly, Mr Uchenna Okafor, urged the nominees to see themselves as agents of positive change in the state. Okafor also urged them to support the governor in implementing his policies and programmes to uplift the living condition of Ndi Anambra. He said the governor also sent another letter requesting the screening of a new Commissioner for Special Duties, Mr Silvester Ezeakenwa, for subsequent confirmation. The nominees are Mr Ifeatu Chinedu (Finance); Prof Ofonze Amucheazi (Lands); Mr Ifeanyi Okoma (Works); Ms Chiamaka Nnake (Budget); Dr Afam Obidike (Health); Mr Patrick Agha-mba (Youth Development); Mrs Ifeyinwa Obinabo (Women/Children Affairs); and Dr Obinna Ugonnadi, among others.
