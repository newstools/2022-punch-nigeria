The Indigenous People of Biafra has said it is planning a one-million-man march with pro-Oduduwa and Ambazonia agitators at the European Union headquarters in Belgium to press for their freedom. The group said this followed the consistent moves by the three nations for their freedom. The Media and Publicity Secretary, IPOB, Emma Powerful, said this in a statement on Tuesday. Powerful said the rally for the emerging nations in West Africa aims to disclose their predicaments to the world on that day. The group said the EU authorities had approved the rally in Brussels, Belgium, for the three emerging nations in West Africa and other nations in Africa. The killings and burning of houses in these three emerging nations have gone beyond human comprehension. Many people are dying every day at the hands of the Nigerian and Cameroon governments. The statement read in part, “The emerging nations of Biafra, Ambazonia, and Oduduwa are expected to be at the EU Headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, on June 14, 15, 2022, to inform the world that they are prepared to be on their own. “This is to show Europe and the entire world why we need these new nations in Africa to emerge. Our people must make sure they let the world understand our predicaments and what we are facing in the hands of Nigeria and Cameroon. “The governments of Nigeria and Cameroon are terrorist nations, and we will not allow them to trample on our people and kill them at random. The killings and burning of houses in these three emerging nations have gone beyond human comprehension. Our people are dying every day in the hands of the Nigeria and Cameroon governments.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
