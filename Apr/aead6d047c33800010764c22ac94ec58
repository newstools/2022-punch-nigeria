Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, on Sunday commiserated with the families of six Islamic clerics who lost their lives in an auto crash while returning from Sumaila Local Government Area recently. “The death of these gentlemen is not only a great loss to their families, but to the entire state. It was a tragedy,” he said. “We learnt that the clerics led by one Sheikh Alkassim Zakariyya embarked on a tour under the umbrella of Imam Malik Islamic Foundation.” In a press statement, Chief Press Secretary, Abba Anwar, quoted Governor Ganduje as saying: “Our dear state lost people of substance who are God-fearing, among whom were Sheikh Alkassim, Malam Isiya Tela, Mustapha Musa Sa’ad, Malam Ishaq Rummawa and Malam Zakariyya Alkassim Dataka. May Allah forgive them,” he prayed. “On behalf of the government and people of Kano state, I am extending our condolences to their families, Imam Malik Islamic Foundation and their friends over the great loss. May Allah forgive all their shortcomings and reward their good deeds with Jannatul Fiddaus,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
