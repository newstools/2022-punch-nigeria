The Taraba State chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Col. Agbu Kefas (retd.), on Monday denied picking the party’s governorship nomination form ahead of the 2023 elections. In a telephone interview with our correspondent in Jalingo, Kefas dismissed the rumour making the rounds that he bought nomination form to contest the party’s governorship ticket. He said, “I don’t know why people are agitated about me. They are just making me popular by putting that write-up in the ‘Taraba Truth and Fact’ newspaper. “If I am going to buy a form, I will make it public, and people will know about it. I am working with the governor, and naturally, he should be interested in who succeeds him. So, it is not true that I have picked a form. “The governor has not thrown the ticket open, so I don’t know what the speculation about me is all about.” Our correspondent reports that Kefas hails from the southern zone where the state governor, Darius Ishaku, who is completing his second and final term of four years, is from.
