Chelsea responded in perfect fashion after back-to-back defeats by thrashing Southampton 6-0 following braces from Mason Mount and Timo Werner. The Blues had been beaten 4-1 at home by Brentford in their last Premier League outing before losing 3-1 to Real Madrid in their Champions League quarter-final first leg on Wednesday. But any concerns over their form were put to bed with a ruthless display at St Mary’s from the moment Marcos Alonso gave them an eighth-minute lead. Chelsea were 3-0 up after just 21 minutes and were six in front within an hour as Southampton wilted in the sunshine although at least avoided another 9-0 drubbing. Mount set up Alonso with a brilliant flick for the opener before the England midfielder struck a sweet effort from the edge of the area which found the corner. Werner had already hit a post and the crossbar before he raced away from Jan Bednarek, rounded Fraser Forster and slotted into an empty net from an angle for Chelsea’s third. Copyright PUNCH.
