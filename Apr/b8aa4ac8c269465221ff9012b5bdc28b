Some gunmen suspected to be crude oil thieves have reportedly attacked a military checkpoint near an oil well at Ogboibiri operated by the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria in the Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. The PUNCH gathered that one of the suspects was killed while a soldier sustained gunshot wounds in the shootout on Sunday. According to sources, the deceased was from one of the communities in the area. The hoodlums were said to have stormed the oil facility in three speedboats. But the soldiers on duty guarding the SPDC oil asset engaged them in a gun duel. They killed one of them while a soldier was reportedly wounded. “The soldiers shot dead one of the boys, but one of the soldiers was wounded,” a source said. However, another source claimed that the militants carted away one military rifle during the incident. Attempts to get a reaction from a spokesman for the 16 Division of the Nigerian Army, Elebele, Yenagoa, and Captain Victor Odukoya, failed. A security source confirmed the incident, adding that efforts were on to recover the stolen military rifle and arrest the suspects. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
