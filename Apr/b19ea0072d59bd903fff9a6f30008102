The Catholic Bishop of Lafia Diocese, Reverend David Ajang, has urged Nigerians to promote love for the country more than individual interests. He said that people should love one another, irrespective of religious and ethnic differences to ensure peace and development of the country. Ajang advised in an interview with newsmen on Sunday in Lafia, Nasarawa, after conducting the 2022 Easter Service at Saint Williams Catholic Cathedral. The bishop said the lack of patriotism from leaders and followers was responsible for what the country was going through. He said that both leaders and the led had roles to play to change the situation of the country for the better. “The leaders must be more serious and place the love for the people and the country above the love for themselves and do everything within their power to effect the desired change. “The ruler on their part must give up selfishness and promote the Nigerian identity rather than promoting individual’s tribe and religion,” the cleric said. Ajang, however, said that ironically every Nigerian wanted change, but all wanted the next person to change for good and not themselves. He said that leaders and followers must sincerely change to be better persons for things to work out for the good of the country. He urged Nigerians to trust God that the seeming victory of evil was temporary because, in the end, God would manifest his power and good would defeat evil. The bishop noted that the Lent period culminated in the celebration of Easter and it was the process of transformation for Christians. He explained that the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ had brought salvation to mankind and man indeed was safe. He expressed the hope that, given the transformation of Christians during this period, they were now better persons than they were and were now spiritually positioned to change the country for good.
