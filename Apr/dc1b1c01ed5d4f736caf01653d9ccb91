Nigerian Music Executive, Soso Soberekan, has lamented the spate of traffic robberies on Lagos roads. On Wednesday, the White Lion Group boss posted a video of his damaged car on his Instagram page and demanded action from the state Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to curb the menace. “@jidesanwoolu the traffic robberies in Lagos are getting too much, do something as soon as possible,” he wrote. “From Lekki expressway, Freedom way, Ojota, Oshodi, nowhere is safe.” Showing shards of broken glass in the car seat, the former manager of Five Star Music declared war on “unexplainable” people walking around in traffic. “See my car. Traffic robbers, I’m declaring war. All those unexplainable people around traffic. I don’t care who you are, either beggar or any age. This is what you guys did to me yesterday, messed up my car, traffic robbers. “No problem. Since the government cannot protect us, we will protect ourselves,” he said in the video. Copyright PUNCH.
