Rainstorm has wreaked havoc on the Ekiti Baptist High School, Igede Ekiti, in the Ifelodun/Irepodun Local Government Area of Ekiti State, blowing off the roofs of several buildings. Among buildings affected by the storm, which was accompanied by rain, were the school chapel, two classroom blocks, dormitory, dining hall and principal’s office. The Old Students Association of the school, while lamenting the damage, said with the incident, it would be difficult for the students to return to school in May. The National Public Relations Officer of the association, Funmi Jemirye, said, “We want the public to know that the rains of last week adversely damaged our alma mater. We are calling on the Ekiti State Government, public-spirited people and old students and other stakeholders to come to the aid of the school.” Jemiriye said the appeal for support was necessary in view of the enormous resources to the tune of millions of naira needed to fix the damage. She said, “The students are billed to resume alongside their peers in the state early May. There is no way it will not be inconvenient to the students because they cannot use any of the damaged buildings.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
