A Kano Chief Magistrates’ Court has ordered the remand of 107-year-old Furera Abubakar, and Isah Hassan, 17, in a correctional centre for allegedly plucking out the eye of a 12-year-old boy. The prosecution counsel, Mr Lamido Soron-Dinki, told the court on Wednesday, that the defendants committed the offence on March 19, at Rimin Hamza Quarters, Tarauni Local Government Area of Kano State. Abubakar and Isah, both residents of Dantsinke Quarters, Kano, are standing trial on a two-count bordering on criminal conspiracy and attempt to commit culpable homicide. Soron-Dinki alleged that on the same date at about 9:00 pm, the defendants conspired, deceived and lured Mustapha Yunus to a nearby stream and plucked out his right eye with a sharp knife. “As a result, the victim sustained grievous hurt and was rushed to Murtala Muhammad Specialist Hospital, where he was admitted for treatment,” the prosecutor claimed, adding that ”the offences contravened the provision of sections 97 and 229 of the Penal Code”. The plea of the defendants was, however, not taken. The Chief Magistrate, Mr Muhammad Jibril, subsequently ordered the remand of the defendants in a correctional centre and adjourned the matter until April 11, for further mention. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the Kano State Police Command had, on March 29, arrested the defendants. It was revealed that the first defendant, Isah, was allegedly ordered to bring a human eye to be used in preparing an “appear-and-disappear” charm by the second defendant, Abubakar. (NAN)
