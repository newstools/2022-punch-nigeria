At what age did you learn how to cook? I learnt how to cook when I was 14 years old. I did not really learn how to cook when I was in my parent’s house because I had elder sisters (who did more of the cooking). It was when I got to the university that I started cooking very well. What is your favourite food? My favourite food is starch and owo soup. What food do you know how to prepare very well? I can prepare okra, oha, okazi, afang, fried beans, owo soup and starch. I am also very good at preparing Igbo food because I’m married to an Igbo man. What was the first food you learnt how to prepare very well? The first food I learnt how to prepare was stew. Which food do you wish you could prepare very well but you have not yet perfected? I am a sucker for Chinese delicacies and I really want to learn how to cook them. They are really nice. What foods do you like but cannot eat for one reason or the other? That would be cold spaghetti. When I was pregnant, I ate it but later vomited it. Now, I can’t eat it like that again. I no longer have the appetite for it.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
