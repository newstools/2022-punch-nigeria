The PUNCH had reported that investors committed about N3.36tn to Federal Government bonds between January and December 2021. In addition, bond oversubscriptions hit N1.61tn last year, which is slightly higher than the oversubscription reached in the first three months of 2022. Experts have said that investors will likely go for FGN bonds over other bonds since the bonds qualify for tax exemption In December 2011, the Federal Government issued the Companies Income Tax (Exemption of Bonds and Short-Term Government Securities) Order, 2011, and the Value Added Tax (Exemption of Proceeds of the Disposal of Government and Corporate Securities) Order, 2011. The orders exempted the interests and proceeds from the disposal of short-term FG securities and bonds, from CIT and VAT respectively. These covered bonds issued by the federal, state, and local governments and their agencies, and by corporate and supranational entities. According to the gazetted copies of the orders, the exemptions will be effective for a period of 10 years starting from January 2, 2012. However, bonds issued by the FG will continue to enjoy the CIT and VAT exemptions after the expiration of the 10-year term, which expired on January 2, 2022. The tax exemptions make the FGN bonds more attractive to investors than other bonds.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
