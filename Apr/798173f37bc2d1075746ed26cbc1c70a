The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission says it has raided shipping companies over high shipping charges. The Executive Vice Chairman of FCCPC, Babatunde Irukera, who said this in an event in Lagos, also announced that the agency had begun investigations into shipping companies over the high cost of moving products into Nigeria. He decried outrageous rates charged by shipping companies operating in the country, noting that their activities had resulted in astronomical increases in the cost of products in the market. He said, “We have opened large investigations into shipping companies. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, a container from China to Lagos was going for between $3,500 to $5,000. Gradually, the shipping of the same container went up to $14,000. By the time we intervened in the shipping industry, it came down to $10,500”. The FCCPC boss urged companies to be responsible and responsive to customer care services. According to him, the government was more accessible and easier to find than private individuals because individuals would always want to make profits. “Industry must prioritize responsiveness and responsibility to their customers. Customers responsiveness is a core to business and FCCPC owes this as a responsibility,” he said.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
