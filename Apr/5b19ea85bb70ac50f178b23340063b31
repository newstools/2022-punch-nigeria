The Abia State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps has said it has successfully dislodged operators of illegal refineries in the oil communities of the Ukwa West Local Government Area. The state Commandant, NSCDC, Ayinla Olowo, stated this while speaking to journalists at the command headquarters in Umuahia, adding that the residents played wonderful roles by providing credible information, which was utilised judiciously. He stated, “We have successfully dislodged operators of illegal refineries in the Ukwa West LG and disconnected the pipes through which they siphoned petroleum products from Shell and Nigerian National Petroleum Company’s pipelines, and destroyed their pots. “After a careful review of our operations in the Ukwa West LG, we have observed that the operators of the illegal refineries are diehards and can only be dislodged through our new strategy that enables us to destroy and occupy, and this has deterred their return to the sites.” Olowo commended the Commandant-General, NSCDC, Ahmed Audi, for providing the command with logistics that enhanced operation in areas he described as difficult terrains, and gave an assurance that his men would live up to expectation. The commandant also pointed out that the Peace and Conflict Resolution Unit of the NSCDC had been strengthened and repositioned to mediate between willing parties in the state as there was no alternative to peace and peaceful coexistence. He advised members of the public to explore alternative dispute resolution mechanisms before embarking on endless litigation.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
