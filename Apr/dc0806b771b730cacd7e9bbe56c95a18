A member of the National Youth Service Corps, identified as Stephanie Se-Ember Terungwa, has been found dead in Abuja. The NYSC Director of Press and Public Relations, Eddy Megwa, said this in a short statement on Thursday. He said, “The attention of NYSC management has been drawn to the pictures making the rounds in the social media of a missing corps member deployed to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. “The corpse was found wearing the NYSC Khaki trouser with the face defaced beyond recognition. “On account of this, management reported the discovery to relevant security agencies to help identify the body. It was later confirmed that the remains was that of a missing corps member, Stephanie Se-Ember Terungwa, with State Code Number FC/21B/5807. “Investigations are, however, currently on-going to unravel the identity of the perpetrators of the dastardly act in order to bring them to justice. May her soul rest in peace.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
