The Nigeria Economic Zones Association has expressed concern over the increased movement of oil tankers in the Lekki axis of Lagos State. The association spoke after Pinnacle Oil & Gas FZE commenced its operations in the zone. The Executive Secretary of the association, Toyin Elegbede, made the concerns known during the association’s meeting with the Managing Director of the Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority, Prof Adesoji Adesugba in Abuja. He also noted with displeasure that efforts so far made by the association to get both the Lekki Free Zone Development Company and Pinnacle Oil & Gas FZE to resolve the emerging traffic crisis has not yielded any results. He said the development is hampering business operations within the Zone. Elegbede said, “This has led to scores of tankers parking on the road, effectively converting it into a truck park thereby affecting the flow of traffic and throwing all stakeholders in the axis in a deep state of distress. “The current shortage of fuel has exacerbated the issue as it has hampered the operations of other businesses operating from the axis. “This situation, if not tackled early enough, will render the whole axis not conducive for businesses, and this will negatively affect the country’s drive for economic development through the Free Trade Zone scheme.” Responding, the NEPZA MD said the agency had concluded plans to address the emerging traffic gridlock. The NEPZA boss commended the association for its intervention, adding that the association was effectively playing its role as the industry trade association for economic zones in the country.
