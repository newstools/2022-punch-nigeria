The convener of ‘Hangout with Tee,’ Titi Oyemade, has said Nigerian women are capable of leading the country. Oyemade, in a statement on Tuesday, said it was unfortunate that women do not get the kind of support given to men in society. She was quoted to have spoken during the ‘Hangout with Tee’ event held in Lagos on Sunday. “I’m passionate about women, and I realise that many women do not have time for themselves. They are always taking care of their children and partners, but they do not take care of themselves. I tried to encourage women to set aside time to take care of themselves and have fun. “The programme is for women to come and relax and have fun. We are saying that create time to do that thing you love. “Nigerian women are capable of providing leadership for the country, but the thing is that they are not getting enough support. Women have empathy, they are compassionate, and that is why we need to have more women in leadership positions,” Oyemade added. Veteran broadcaster, Bimbo Oloyede, a guest speaker at the event, urged women to believe in themselves. Oloyede said, “Women should be themselves, be natural, and stop limiting the way they think. They should stop thinking that there are certain things they can’t do because of their gender. I believe we all have a variety of gifts and talents, and they could all be used in different ways.”
