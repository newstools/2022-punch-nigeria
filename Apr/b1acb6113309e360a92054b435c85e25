The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics on Thursday threatened to resume its strike which was suspended on June 10, 2021, if the Federal Government failed to meet its demands within one month. The union’s President, Anderson Ezeibe, disclosed this to journalists in Yola, Adamawa State capital, during its National Executive Council meeting. Ezeibe, who said ASUP was close to resuming the suspended industrial strike action, noted that the union would reconvene in one month to take the decision. He listed the union’s demands to include the release the N15bn revitalisation fund to address the decay in infrastructure in the sector; and payment of the arrears of polytechnic employees following the approval and implementation of new minimum wage. Ezeibe said, “We are informing the government and members of the public that we are close to resuming that suspended strike action. “In fact, if the current status continues in the next one month, then what it means is that the resumption of that particular strike action will be a very serious issue for consideration.” “The NEC, the highest decision making organ of the union empowered to declare strike action, is going to reconvene after one month to take this very important decision.” Copyright PUNCH.
