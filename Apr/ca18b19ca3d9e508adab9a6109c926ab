A group within the All Progressives Congress, Emefiele Mobilisation Team, has called on Nigerians to support the call for the Central Bank Governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele, to run for the presidency in 2023. The Team Lead and National Coordinator of EMT, Dr Jacob Attah, made the call at a news conference on behalf of the National Executive Committee of the group in Lokoja, on Saturday. He said the team comprised of patriots who had come together to showcase the leadership qualities of the CBN governor. He said, “We call on all patriots to stand up and be counted in the all-important task of who becomes the next President of Nigeria and support the call for Mr Godwin Ifeanyichukwu Emefiele to run for the highest office in our nation. “At a time when Nigeria is passing through a lot of economic and security challenges, we must bring in experience, dynamism, energy, equity and fairness in the choice of who becomes the next President of Nigeria. “Over the past eight years at the helm of affairs of the apex bank, Mr Emefiele has shown capacity, focus, courage and worked tirelessly with the economic team of President Muhammadu Buhari to keep the economy of our great country afloat above recession and outright collapse. “His policies in the area of education, health, agriculture, industry and social credits have brought about positive transformation in these sectors and strengthened the Nigerian economy.” The coordinator stressed that Emefiele had done well as CBN governor and that his policies had reflected in the growth of the Gross Domestic Product and created lots of employment in all states of the federation.
