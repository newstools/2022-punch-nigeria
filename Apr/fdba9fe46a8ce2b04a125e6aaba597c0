Enugu Rangers will be hoping to bounce back from their disappointing 2-1 loss to Enyimba in the Oriental derby in their matchday 22 fixture in Aba but will face a stern test against visiting Sunshine Stars. The Akure Gunners are coming off the back of a 1-0 win over Abia Warriors last Sunday and will fancy their chances of earning at least a point at the Akwa Stadium. However, Rangers coach Abdu Maikaba and midfielder Kenechukwu Agu will be hoping to make the trip from Akule less memorable for the visitors as they are hoping to get the maximum points so as to stay in the race for the league title. “Sure, no two matches are the same but I have the strong belief that we will emerge victorious in the game against Sunshine Stars. I know that they made some mid-season recruitment including a new coach, but we are determined to get the result we desire,” Maikaba said. “Our first meeting ended goalless but we are not letting that result get into our head as we are focused on playing our normal game on a very good pitch to achieve the result we need.” Speaking ahead of the game, Agu said it’s a must win for the Flying Antelopes. “We are going to give our best to ensure that the three points is ours at the end of the encounter. Sunshine Stars are a good side and have been doing good lately but we are in the right frame of mind to make our supporters proud.” Rangers are currently third in the league behind Rivers United and Plateau United who at the moment are the clear frontrunners for the league title.
