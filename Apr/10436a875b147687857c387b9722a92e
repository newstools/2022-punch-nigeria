The Confederation of African Football has named the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium as the host of the 2022 CAF Champions League final scheduled for Sunday, May 29. Angola’s Atlético Petróleos de Luanda will tackle Morocco’s Wydad in the first semi-final clash while Egypt’s Ah Ahly will be hoping to reach consecutive finals but will have to surpass the hurdle from Algeria’s ES Setif in the other semi-final tie. CAF officials had visited the ‘Nest of Champions’ over four weeks ago to inspect the state of the sporting facilities according to the Senior Special Assistant on Sports to Akwa Ibom State Governor, Paul Bassey. According to reports, the CAF officials who visited the sporting facility gave it a pass mark as they deemed it worthy of hosting the continent’s biggest inter-club competition final. This is the third time the finals of the competition will be played in a single final format as opposed to a two-legged fixtures format, which was being used in the competition since 1966. The first one-legged final was played at the Cairo International Stadium in Egypt while the 2021 edition took place at the Stade Mohammed V in Morocco.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
