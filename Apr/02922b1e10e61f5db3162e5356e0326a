The United States embassy in Nigeria has said that individuals studying in the US may be eligible to renew their student visa without an interview when they return to Nigeria this summer. However, to qualify for the procedure, the applicant must be physically present to renew a student visa that is still valid or has expired within the last 24 months. The embassy in a statement in Abuja on Thursday further explained that an eligible student must continue participation in the same major course of study even if at a different institution or attend the same institution even if in a different major course of study. It stated, “To qualify for this procedure, you must be physically in Nigeria renewing a student visa that is still valid or has expired within the past 24 months and is renewing your visa either to: (a) continue participation in the same major course of study even if at a different institution; or (b) attend the same institution even if in a different major course of study.” Copyright PUNCH.
