Busayo, the wife of Lanre Gentry, says contrary to what some people think, her husband is no longer bothered about his ex-wife Mercy Aigbe. She told Saturday Beats, “Whatever happened between them (my husband and Mercy Aigbe) then and now is none of my business. That was a family before mine and they never existed to me. Besides, we all have our different ways of healing. What social media doesn’t know is that people only let you know what they want you to know, and my husband doesn’t just act without a reason. If people feel he hasn’t gotten over Mercy Aigbe, that’s because that’s how they see it. He is only concerned about his son and I believe if he hadn’t gotten over her, he wouldn’t have remarries.” Busayo, who recently gave birth to a daughter, noted that motherhood had changed her. She said, “Motherhood has been challenging, sweet. There is an unexplainable joy that comes when I look at my beautiful princess, and I know she’s mine.” On how she feels being married to Gentry, she said, “I feel absolutely nothing about it. I am still the same person I used to be. I just moved to a different class of life. It hasn’t changed who I am. “I met my husband at a business meeting and I liked him because he was a very ‘free’ person. He knew exactly what he wanted and he went for it. I like people who have clarity of objectives. He always looks after my growth which is my priority.” On if she is interested in the entertainment industry, she said, “I might go into the entertainment industry; I cannot tell yet. However, it would not be movies. I would be showing more of myself in politics in the long run. My latest project will be known to the public once it is ready.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
