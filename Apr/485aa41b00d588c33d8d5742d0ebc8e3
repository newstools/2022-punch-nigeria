Former National Women Leader of the Peoples Democratic Party, Josephine Anenih, has said that the 35 per cent affirmative action for women in various offices is not automatic as women must work their way up. Anenih, who is also a former Minister of Women Affairs, said this on Monday during a meeting with the PDP National Woman Leader, Prof Stella Effah-Attoe, and the 2022/23 PDP female aspirants. She said, “If you are not qualified and nobody knows you in your place, you won’t get the seat you are looking for. “Some of you, if we ask, when did you last attend your ward meeting or state meeting? And you now want to be a House of Representatives member or Governor? It’s a tall order. “The 35 percent affirmative action we are clamouring for is not magic. We must work hard for it. Don’t give PDP a bad name by saying women are marginalised. If you are qualified, you will be given a chance.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
