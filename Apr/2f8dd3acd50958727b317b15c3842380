The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), Monday in Abuja condoled the family of former Minister of Youth, Sports and Culture, Alabo Graham-Douglas, who passed away on Monday, April 25, 2022. Buhari’s condolence message is contained in a statement signed late Monday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, titled ‘President Buhari mourns Alabo Tongue Graham Douglas’. According to Adesina, “President Buhari sympathises with Government and people of Rivers State over the loss of the political stalwart, democrat and administrator, who served differently as Minister of Aviation, Minister of Labour and Productivity, and Minister of Tourism, leaving a legacy of distinguished service to the nation. “The President notes the historic roles Alabo Graham-Douglas played in entrenching democratic rule and liberal culture, joining well-meaning Nigerians and global leaders to stand and speak for justice and fairness, while promoting grassroots development among his people. “President Buhari believes the investments of the departed in people and building of institutions will be remembered by posterity.” He, therefore, prayed that the Almighty God will grant his soul a peaceful rest, and comfort his family.
