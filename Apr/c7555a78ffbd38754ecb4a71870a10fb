Abia State Government has said that it will key into the Federal Government’s project for the acquisition of Malaria vaccine. The Project Manager, State Malaria Eradication Programme, Obasi Arua, disclosed this in Umuahia on Tuesday on the occasion of the 2022 World Malaria Day celebration. Arua said, “We are expecting the vaccine importation into Nigeria. When the country does so, we will buy into it”. He said that the malaria scourge was an epidemic, hence the need for people to sleep inside mosquito nets. The project manager added that Abia is number one in readiness to implement the programme. In his speech, the state Commisisoner for Health, Joe Osuji, said the state government has demonstrated its political will to ensure that malaria is kicked out of the state. The state, he said,is the first to pay its own counterpart fund and has distributed mosquito nets, adding, “I hope Nigeria will join in the acquisition of vaccine against malaria as has been done in some countries” in Africa.” Also speaking, the Executive Secretary, Abia State Primary Health Care Development Agency, Chinagozi Adindu, described malaria as “a socio-economic threat to the country” and an agent of sicknesses and death, pointing out that it was not caused by excess oil in the body but through mosquito bites. In her speech after her investiture as ‘Malaria Elimination Ambassador’, the wife of the state governor, Nkechi Ikpeazu, said the disease was preventable and curable, hence the need to keep the environment clean. The global fight against malaria she said, was a fight against poverty and dirty environment. She, therefore, challenged governments and international organizations to stand up and fight the scourge.
