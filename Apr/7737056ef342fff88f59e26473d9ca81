A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress and its presidential aspirant, Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim on Tuesday promised to convene a Government of National Unity if elected President in the 2023 general election. He also pledged to ensure devolution of powers from the centre to the component units should he assume power next year. Olawepo-Hashim, presidential candidate of the Trust Party in the 2019 general elections, stated these in an interview with journalists in Abuja. He said he would make this declaration this month. While faulting the decision of the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi and his counterpart in the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige to stay put in office and declare for the Presidency without resigning, according to Section 84 of the new Electoral Act, he described it as an ethical issue. He said, “Ordinarily, where we are in the country now, we need all the interests to be aggregated into one. We need to include everyone, not to exclude anybody. The country is really divided along ethnic and religious lines, it is very difficult for any party to even produce a candidate right now that can win in more than four zones out of the six zones of the country because of the division in the country. “So, nobody can be a superstar; where we are now, what we need is one who can put in place a Government of National Unity really and by the grace of God, if I win, that is what I am going to do. “I am going to form a Government of National Unity that will include various strands and perspectives and interests, religious dispositions and ethnic dispositions.” Copyright PUNCH.
