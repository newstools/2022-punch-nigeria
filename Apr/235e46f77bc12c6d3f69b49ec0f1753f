Kano Pillars chairman, Surajo Jambul, says the former champions will do all it can to ensure they avoid getting relegated at the end of the season. Pillars had three points deducted from their accumulated points as punishment, after fans of the club attacked players of visiting Katsina United and destroyed their team bus as both sides played out a goalless draw in their Nigeria Professional Football Football League match-day 23 fixture at the Sani Abacha Stadium, Kano. But the Sai Masu Gida picked up a crucial 1-0 victory over Sunshine Stars on Wednesday, thanks to a 12th minute Jerry Alex goal, which helped them move to 17th on the log from 19th. Although they’re still in the relegation zone, the chairman of the club, Jambul, is optimistic they would avoid relegation at the end of the season. “We know what was done was wrong and we’re not contesting the decision (three points deduction). Our prayer now is to see our team avoid relegation at the end of the season and I believe that is possible because I know we have the players who can do the job,” Jambul told The PUNCH. “They are disappointed that the hard earned points were taken away from them but they are ready to fight till the end to ensure the club does not go down and I’m certain we can achieve that.” Copyright PUNCH.
