…Says incident, barbaric, unacceptable A group, the Ijaw Unity Project in Rivers State, has condemned the reported intrusion and attack on the residence of a governorship aspirant in the 2023 general elections, Tonye Princewill, by yet-to-be identified gunmen on Friday, urging the police to unmask the perpetrators. The group, in a statement signed by its Chairman, Beks Dagogo-Jack, and the Secretary, Ken Robinson, said Princewill is a prominent Ijaw son, stating they would not allow anything untoward to befall him. They called on the state Police Command to unmask those behind the attack and make them face the law. Princewill, a governorship hopeful under the platform of the All Progressives Congress, had in a statement alleged an assassination attempt on him in the early hours of Friday. He said the gunmen broke into his GRA residence and in a room they suspected to be his own, saying they only carted away a Close Circuit TV recorder, saying he remained their only target and linked the incident to politics. The group’s statement read in part, “The Ijaw Unity Project described the action as barbaric and unacceptable in today’s world. It’s disheartening that some evil-minded persons want to take Rivers State back to the tragic past. “The group urges politicians and their supporters to shun such evil and wicked acts, and adopt peaceful and civilised approaches in the pursuit of their quest to govern Rivers State. “Rivers State and its people will not allow murderers and killers to govern it. The Ijaw Unity Project further urges security agencies to ensure that the perpetrators of the evil act and their sponsors are apprehended and made to bear the full wrath of the law.” Copyright PUNCH.
