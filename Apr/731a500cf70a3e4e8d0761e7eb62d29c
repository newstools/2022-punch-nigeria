The Federal Government has urged security operatives to crackdown on illegal refineries in Imo State. The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Farouq, gave the directive in Owerri, on Thursday when she paid a condolence visit to the state government over last Friday night’s explosion at a forest in Abaezi community in the Ohaji Egbema Local Government Area of the state, which claimed over 100 lives. The minister was represented by Alhasan Nuhu. She urged community leaders to cooperate with governments to curb oil theft in oil-producing areas. She said her ministry would work with the National Emergency Management Agency to provide relief materials to the affected community. She said, “We have come to Imo State to convey the Federal Government’s sympathy to the government and good people of the state over the unfortunate explosion at Abaezi forest, Ohaji Egbema LGA, which occurred on Saturday, April 23, 2022. “This unfortunate disaster happened only one week after another tanker explosion in Lagos. “We pray for the repose of the souls of those who lost their lives in the disaster and condoled with their families and the government of Imo State. While certain hazards or disasters are unpreventable, we shall continue to pray to the Almighty God for His mercy, protection, and understanding of disaster risks and how to avoid them.” Copyright PUNCH.
