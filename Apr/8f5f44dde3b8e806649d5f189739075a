At least two persons were injured when security operatives and hoodlums clashed at the Abonnema wharf in the Port Harcourt City Local Government Area of Rivers State. The security operatives, who are attached to the Government House, were said to be on a routine patrol in the area following a recent fire outbreak. The hoodlums, on sighting the operatives, opened fire which the latter responded. The hoodlums, however, fled the scene due to the superior fire power of the security operatives. Speaking to journalists, the Camp Commandant, Rivers State Government House, Owen Irikefe, said they were at the Abonnema wharf to monitor activities of illegal oil refining when his men were attacked. Irikefe said two of his men who were injured during the gun battle were receiving treatment. The commandant stated, “As we were patrolling, we saw a group of boys from nowhere. We were hearing shooting from the other side. “So we entered and there was an exchange of gunfire. They ran away. When we entered, we discovered that oil bunkering activities were taking place and were violent. “We arrested some of them. The materials used for bunkering such as drums and AK-47 rifle, pump action, locally made pistol and others, were recovered.” He said the recovered weapons were sent to the office of the Commissioner of Police as exhibits. Irikefe warned criminal elements, especially around the Abonnema wharf, to desist from such activities, saying the law would catch up with them. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
