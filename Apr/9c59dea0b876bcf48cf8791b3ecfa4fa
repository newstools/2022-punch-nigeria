Ahead of 2023 general election, a Dublin-based medical consultant, Dr Gbenga Salawu, has joined the race for the Osun-West Senatorial ticket of the All Progressives Congress. An indigene of Iwo, Salawu, who practises Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopaedics in Dublin, Republic of Ireland, in a statement he personally signed, obtained in Osogbo on Sunday, said he possessed the qualities required of a good representative. Salawu further said, “I am eminently qualified. I am widely accepted and well-loved by the people for various reasons. I have been unflinchingly loyal to the party in spite of my past experience in the politics of the party. I am neither an impromptu nor opportunistic aspirant. “I am vastly experienced in management, diplomacy and organisational leadership. I am well-exposed internationally and above all, I am a responsible person.” On the chances of the APC at the July 16 Osun governorship poll, Salawu said the ruling party had good chances of winning the election, going by the smooth running of Osun affairs by the governor, Adegboyega Oyetola. “As it stands now, I can assure you that a great number of the people in the minority faction have fallen in line with IleriOluwa. Many more are planning, scheming and begging to return into our fold. “The teeming populace, civil servants and artisans alike, all singing IleriOluwa’s praises. We are cruising to victory in July by God’s grace and indeed at the general election in February next year,” Salawu concluded. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
