Agrolog Limited said it has empowered 60,000 smallholder farmers in the ginger value chain to boost productivity and enhance entrepreneurial farming with women farmers in collaboration with Mastercard Foundation. It said in a statement that since 2018, Agrolog has invested in developing the ginger value chain by using its internal resources to support an out-grower scheme, reaching an aggregate of 10,000 farmers. “This collaborative effort is focused on providing immediate material, capacity, and structural support to 60,000 smallholder farmers out of the over 1.2 million vulnerable indigenous ginger farming communities of Kaduna State, spanning 12 local government areas,” it said. As a result of the first year’s harvest, Agrolog said it embarked on vigorous training of women within the project community to help them process some of their harvests into ginger juice, powder, oil, spices and syrup to create new markets within and outside these communities. It said the training featured over 100 women trained in batches who would become merchants for processed ginger in Southern Kaduna. The Managing Director, Agrolog Limited, Dr Manzo Maigari, said the Nigerian variety of ginger is very much in demand and can serve as a significant source of income for the country. He said it is also acclaimed to be of superior qualities with an outstanding flavour and is in heavy demand in the international market.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
