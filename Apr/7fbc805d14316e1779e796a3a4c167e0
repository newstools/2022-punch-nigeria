The Peoples Democratic Party on Sunday in Abuja warned the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, that his threat to hire foreign mercenaries to combat terrorists in the North West would only compound the security woes in the region. In a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, the opposition party said the governor cannot distance himself from the challenges allegedly caused by the All Progressives Congress which he is part of. The statement is titled ‘Foreign Mercenaries: APC leaders fueled terrorism; PDP tells El-Rufai.’ The main opposition said it “wants Governor el-Rufai to know that his suggestion or threats to import foreign mercenaries is counter-productive and capable of compounding the already dire security situation in our country. “The PDP believes in the competence and capability of our gallant Armed Forces to defend our nation. “They are only being encumbered by manifest complicity, conspiracy, incompetence and failure of the Security Command and Control Coordination structure of the APC administration.” It also argued that the expression of frustration and threats by Governor El-Rufai to invite foreign mercenaries is further confirmation and admission of the failure of the APC-led administration “in which he is a key player.” It insisted that the one-time FCT Minister cannot “distance himself from those responsible for fueling and aiding insecurity which degenerated to acts of terrorism ravaging our nation today.”  Copyright PUNCH.
