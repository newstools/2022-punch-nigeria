A Magistrate Court sitting in Akure, the Ondo State capital, has sentenced Chinaza Njoku, 35, to six years imprisonment for stealing palm-oil. Njoku was arrested and arraigned before the court for stealing 25 litres of palm oil worth N20,000 on April 17, 2022, at No 36, Iluyemi street, Ondo town, Ondo State. He was charged on a two-count of stealing and felony. The prosecutor, Inspector Bernard Olagbayi, told the court that the convict stole a keg of palm oil belonging to one Mrs Veronica Akinrinlola, adding that the convict used his key to open the door of the complainant’s residence and unlawfully entered the place to commit felony. According to the charge sheet, the offence committed contravenes Sections 412 and 390(9) of the Criminal Code Cap 34 Vol.1, Laws of Ondo State, 2006. The convict pleaded guilty to the charge levelled against him but prayed the court to temper justice with mercy in its judgement. In her judgement, the magistrate, Mrs Charity Adeyanju, found the convict guilty of the offence of theft brought against him by the prosecution. Consequently, she convicted and sentenced him to six years imprisonment on counts one and two due to the magnitude of the offence, adding that the sentence should run concurrently. The court, however, gave him an option of N100,000 fine.
