Kano State Hisbah Board had confirmed that it recorded a huge success by impounding not less than 250 cartons of beer and other intoxicants over the weekend. The Board’s Commander-General, Harun Sina, disclosed that the board was able to achieve the feat while inspecting two loaded vehicles, with assorted beer consignment, including other intoxicants, with their identity concealed, to ease their smuggle into the state. Sani stated that the agency had intensified its campaigns and advocacy visits to enlighten the public about the dangers of engaging in condemnable activities. He commended the Head of the Anti-intoxicants unit and his team for their relentless efforts in scuttling the distribution of beer and other harmful drugs in the state. Earlier, the Head of the Anti-intoxicants unit, Jamilu Yakasai, said they successfully arrested 12 vehicles suspected to be used in smuggling beer into Kano during Ramadan. He disclosed that over 250 cartons of the impounded beer were in their custody. Yakasai emphasised that the unit would not relent in its efforts to stamp out beer consumption in Kano. Sina stressed that the intoxicants were carefully packaged to conceal their detection. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
