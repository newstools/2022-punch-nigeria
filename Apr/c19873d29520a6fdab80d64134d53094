THE leadership of The Apostolic Church Nigeria, Umuahia, has disowned one Salem Chukwunyere who is standing trial in an Umuahia High Court over murder. It said it was not true that the murder suspect is a pastor of the church. The church’s position was contained in a statement by its Secretary, Frank Irole, and read by Chukwunyere  Nwabuko at a press conference in Umuahia on  Sunday. “The culprit who is currently on trial in the court is not a pastor of the church as he claimed,” the church said. According to the statement, the church has only two pastors – Eberechukwu Igwe (Umuahia Area Superintendent) and Pastor Kenneth Igwe (Assistant Pastor). “He (Salem) cannot show any letter of appointment, posting letter or even evidence of salary payments/bank alerts by the church,” the statement added, wondering why the suspect, who only joined the 55 Awolowo Branch of the church in 2020, could be made a pastor within a few months of joining the church before his eventual exposure in 2021. According to the church, a local church, such as 55 Awolowo Assembly lacks the powers to make/ordain one a pastor as pastors are recruited and sent from the Igbo Land Territorial Headquarters, Amumara-Mbaise, Imo State. The statement added, “The church condemns in its entirety the wicked act of murder which Salem has confessed to be involved in. “Life is so sacred and sacrosanct that even an unbeliever in Christ should not contemplate killing. “We enjoin the media not to associate the church with the dastardly act as it is not only ungodly but a taboo that should not be condoned by anybody not to talk of the church of Jesus Christ.”  Copyright PUNCH.
