Veteran Spanish midfielder David Silva has signed a one-year extension with La Liga’s Real Sociedad until the end of the 2022-2023 season, the 36-year-old World Cup winner said on Friday. Silva joined Manchester City after helping Spain to the 2010 World Cup and played a key role in four of City’s Premier League triumphs before switching to Real in 2020. “It was an easy decision with a club like this and their fans,” he said of the San Sebastian outfit in the Basque Country. Real Sociedad won the 2020 Copa del Rey and are currently sixth in the league table with five games remaining. AFP
