The Speaker of Plateau House of Assembly, Assemblyman Yakubu Sanda, has urged citizens to be security conscious. Sanda, in his Easter message signed by his Press Secretary, Mr Sabastine Homuk, urged the people to report any suspicious movement or persons to security agencies. The speaker expressed optimism that the security challenges bedevilling the country would be a thing of the past. He urged citizens to forgive and love one another, just as Jesus Christ did. Sanda also urged Christians to imbibe the lessons of sacrifice and peace that the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ signify. The speaker charged Nigerians to act in faith toward God and fellow citizens, and be confident that the nation would overcome its current challenges. “This should be a moment for sober reflection on the many lessons of the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. “Easter teaches us to hope, forgiveness, have faith and love. Let us act in this virtue, love our neighbours and be tolerant of one another,” he added. He called for continuous support and prayers to enable leaders at all levels to succeed in their mandates.
