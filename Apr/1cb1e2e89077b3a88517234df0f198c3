Gombe state Governor, Muhammadu Yahaya, has approved the recruitment of 1000 fresh teachers by Gombe State Teachers’ Service Commission. According to the Chairman of the Teachers’ Service Commission, Mrs Na’omi Maiguwa, this was part of efforts toward consolidating the objectives of the governor’s declaration of a ‘state of emergency on education. She explained that Yahaya’s approval was a result of his genuine concern over the shortage of teachers in public secondary schools across the state. Maiguwa said, “I’m very delighted to inform you that His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Gombe State, Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya (Dan Majen Gombe), moved by the huge shortage of teachers in government schools, has on Wednesday 6th April, 2022 graciously approved the recruitment of 1000 fresh teachers. The TSC boss also noted that no fewer than 288 staff under the State Universal Basic Education Board who applied for transfer, have been granted. “His Excellency has equally approved the transfer of 288 staff of the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) who had applied for transfer of service from the board to the State Ministry of Education’s secondary schools and technical colleges. Maiguwa stated that the recruitment was relevant as the State looked forward to transforming education, stressing that “this is the first time since the creation of Gombe state that government is recruiting and deploying as many as 1288 teachers, as the last exercise which was carried out in August 2018 involved only 700 teachers, less than 60 percent of the number involved in the current exercise.”  Copyright PUNCH.
