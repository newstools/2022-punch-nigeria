A lecturer with the Federal University, Gashua, Yobe State, Sani Mazadu, has been killed in Jos, the Plateau State capital. It was learnt that Mazadu from the Department of Psychology of the institution was killed alongside a tailor, Safiyanu Sa’id, during a clash between two rival groups popularly known as Sara Suka. The incident, it was further gathered, happened around Yankwaba, in the Jos North Local Government Area of the state. A relative of the lecturer, Jamilu Mazadu, confirmed the incident to newsmen in Jos on Tuesday. He said the incident has been reported at the Anguwan Rogo Police Divisional Headquarters. He said policemen had visited the family of the deceased while one of the hoodlums had been arrested. Mazadu said, “The deceased was about to complete his PhD before the incident occurred. “The death of Sani has indeed shocked every one of us but we believe that Almighty Allah has permitted that he would no longer be with us anymore. He and the other victims have been buried this morning.” The spokesman for the state police command, Ubah Ogaba, was unreachable when our correspondent made attempts to contact him on the telephone as his lines were switched off.
