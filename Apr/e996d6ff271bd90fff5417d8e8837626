Popular blogger, Linda Ikeji, has denied claims that her platform is responsible for Caroline Hutchings’ divorce Hutchings, who stars on the “Real Housewives of Lagos” show, stated in the third episode, which aired on Friday, that Ikeji’s blog was the cause of her divorce. In a heated conversation with the blogger’s sister, Laura Ikeji, who also stars in the show, Caroline claimed Linda published lies about her age, and also wrote that her daughter is not her ex-husband’s. Linda Ikeji’s platform, @lindaikejiblogofficial on Instagram, however, fired back at the actress asking her to provide proofs of such publications. In the statement released on Saturday, the blog claimed that Hutchings’ statements were false as it never published stories that put the paternity of her daughter to question. The statement read in part, “In it’s 16 years of blogging, Linda Ikeji Blog never ever wrote that Caroline Danjuma’s daughter is not for her husband. Not only didn’t Linda Ikeji Blog write this, no other blog in Nigeria or beyond wrote this. “This story was completely made up by Caroline Danjuma. Or she could have seen it as a comment made by anonymous commenters on LIB or any other blog.” The platform admitted that it wrote about controversies surrounding the actress’ age, but claimed the publication was without malice. The release also stated that Caroline’s claims that the blogger resented her were false, as Linda “just doesn’t know her.” Hutchings got married to Nigerian businessman, Musa Danjuma, in 2007. They parted ways nine years later, with three children. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
