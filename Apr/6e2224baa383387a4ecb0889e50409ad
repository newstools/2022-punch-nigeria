The newly-elected chairmen for the 33 local government areas of Katsina State were inaugurated on Wednesday by the state Chief Judge, Justice Musa Abubakar. The state governor, Aminu Masari, in his remarks shortly after the inauguration, admonished the chairmen to be prudent and embrace an open-door policy. He warned them of the financial situation in the majority of the councils as he revealed that some councils could not pay staff salaries due to paucity of funds and large number of staff. The governor stated, “Let me warn you of what to expect in some of the councils. Some councils cannot pay staff salaries due to financial situation and large staff. You must look for innovative ways of increasing the internally generated revenue to improve the financial situation of your council. “You must also be transparent and open to your people. May the Almighty Allah give you the wisdom to run your councils in line with the guidelines and regulations.” Masari insisted that the Monday council election that brought in the chairmen was hitch-free. He also said the 12 political parties that participated in the election were given equal opportunity. The governor lauded the Katsina State Independent Electoral Commission for conducting the election and the security agencies for ensuring that peace reigned during the exercise. Election processes in Dutsin-Ma Local Government were halted due to alleged irregularities and crisis. The Peoples Democratic Party had, on Tuesday, threatened to challenge the election, insisting it was fraught with alleged irregularities. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
