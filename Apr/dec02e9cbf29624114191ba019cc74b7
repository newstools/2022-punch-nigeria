The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has arrested one Fidelis Poor, a syndicate member who allegedly conspired to defraud a first-class traditional ruler in Kwara State, Alhaji Idris-Sero Abubakar, to the tune of N33,399,999.00. Poor, 30, who hails from Stwue in Konshisha Local Government Area of Benue State, alongside other suspects (still at large), allegedly conspired to defraud the monarch under the guise that he had a container of goods meant to be used for the development of Okuta community due to be cleared at Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport in Abuja. Abubakar, the Emir of Okuta in the Baruten Local Government Area of the state, is a former member of the House of Representatives. According to a statement signed by the Head of Media and Publicity of EFCC, Wilson Uwujaren, the Emir, in a petition dated November 30, 2021, alleged that a group of fraudsters who operate as a syndicate called him on the telephone that he had a container to clear in Abuja and requested for the said amount for clearance. The monarch stated that the syndicate provided different accounts for him to pay the money for the clearance of the goods, one of which was that of Fidelis Poor. According to him, the fraudsters after that asked him to call one ‘Evangelist Rose Marry Oni (JP)’ to hand over the container. He further stated that efforts to get the goods delivered or recoup his money had been unsuccessful, hence he petitioned the EFCC. Upon receiving the petition, the commission commenced a discrete investigation into the matter, which led to the suspect’s arrest. The suspect would be arraigned upon the conclusion of the investigation. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
