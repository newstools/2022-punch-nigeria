A presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, on Thursday had a consultation with chairmen of the party in the six states in the North Central geo-political zone and the Federal Capital Territory, saying, he would declare for the Presidency on May 3 2022. The choice of the date, he explained, was informed by the need to allow “our Muslims brothers and sisters to conclude the observation of the holy month of Ramadan, which will end on April 30.” Olawepo-Hashim also informed the gathering that at his declaration, he would release to Nigerians his perspectives on important issues including security, job creation, availability and affordability of petroleum products, stable electricity supply, how to tackle corruption, health, education and infrastructure. He maintained that the “solution to national security, unemployment, high cost of petroleum products and basic items required new and fresh approach to handle, that those who have never paid for anything they consume in the past 23 years cannot understand.” He maintained that he is in a better position “to unite the presently badly divided country at a time like this” if he gets the party’s ticket to lead the country in 2023. Olawepo-Hashim in an Iftar Dinner in Abuja  for APC North Central chairmen explained that “anyone who grew up in the North Central zone where about 86 ethnic groups live would have learnt one or two lessons in diversity and those lessons will come in handy to cement the nation’s diversity for greater strength.” Copyright PUNCH.
