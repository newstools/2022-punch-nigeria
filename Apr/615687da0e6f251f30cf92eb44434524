A team of medical experts based in Nairobi, Kenya, has designed an innovative device that helps reduce menstrual pains for women who usually experience serious unease during their menstrual cycle. NTV Kenya notes on Wednesday that the gadget which is already in circulation at a moderate price has leads that are connected to some sticky pads called electrodes, which help deliver small electrical impulses to the painful area of a woman’s body and subsequently ease the pain. One of the leading innovators of the device, who is also the chief executive and co-founder of Swift Wellness, Peter Arina, says watching his friend struggle with menstrual pain gave him chills mired in sympathy, prompting him to devise a healing solution. “The device has leads connected to sticky pads called electrodes. To relieve pain, you attach the pads directly to your skin and turn the device on. The pads will deliver small electrical impulses to the area in pain,” expounds Arina. The health informatics expert reveals that the device’s working mechanism is inspired by a science called gateway control theory, which dictates that in the human body, an external impulse is given priority over an internal impulse. During menses, the pain from the menstrual periods is the internal impulse, and it travels all the way to the brain such that when you place the electrodes and the impulse transmission starts, the external impulse is sent to the brain, which forces it to focus on the external impulse, thereby reducing pain from the abdomen. An Embakasi resident, Jacinta Nzyuko, who tried the device on her, told Health Nation that ”when she attached the electrodes of the device on her lower tummy, it gave vibrations that felt like a massage. In less than 10 minutes, the pain had subsided. Nzyuko said she had been using it ever since. Source: Health Nation
