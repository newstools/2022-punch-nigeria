FOLLOWING the recent launch of The Hypo Toilet Rescue Volunteer programme at the National Youth Service Corps Orientation Camp, Lagos, Hypo has inaugurated an eight-unit rescued toilets at the secretariat in Surulere. A statement on Thursday said the brand through its community development service initiative decided to transform the NYSC secretariat’s restroom to maintain sanitation and hygiene. The firm’s Brand Manager, Mr. Chidera Anele, in the statement, said, “The goal is to bring about a significant change and one vehicle we thought to work with is the National Youth Service Corps because collaborating with the NYSC Community Development Service gives us the leverage to reach communities, public schools, Primary Health Centers and see how we can transform their toilets.” “Before we begin to enter communities, we thought to start the transformation from within, hence the NYSC secretariat facilities rescue. We provided good plumbing system to enable uninterrupted water supply, replaced the water cosets, carried out a complete facelift of the toilet environment to make it standard for use.”
