The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), on Tuesday, debunked media reports on his declaration of interest in the Kebbi State governorship election. A national newspaper (not The PUNCH) had quoted Malami as declaring for the Kebbi governorship position. But in a statement signed by his Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Jubrilu Gwandu, Malami stated that the clarification became necessary due to what he described as the false reports in some sections of the media. The statement partly read, “A video being circulated as the purported declaration was mischievously translated with fabricated insertions and interpolations that cannot in spirit and context establish the malformation circulated.” He, however, thanked the teeming supporters of the minister and the general public, saying “at the appropriate time they will hear from the horse’s mouth in the full glare of the media, stakeholders, like-minds, party faithful and teeming supporters.” The PUNCH reports that Malami, a two-term member of the cabinet of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), is rumoured to be among the top contestants seeking to succeed Atiku Bagudu as the Kebbi State governor in 2023.
