The Executive Director, HEIR Women Development, Añuli Ola-Olaniyi, has decried the prevalence of sexual harassment of girls and young women at work, saying this makes them unproductive and unable to contribute their quota to national development. According to Ola-Olaniyi, the organisation’s research in the Federal Capital Territory shows that 51 per cent of women have been sexually harassed, with three in four women raped at work. She further disclosed that 13 percent of the respondents of the 1,000 online surveys and 60 in-depth interviews were women living with disabilities. In contrast, 78 per cent of respondents said their bosses had harassed them sexually. According to a statement in Abuja on Monday, Ola-Olaniyi stated this during a one-day workshop tagged, ‘Career Barriers and Workplace Sexual Harassment against Young Women in Nigeria,’ organised by HEIR Women Development with support from Ford Foundation. She called on the Corporate Affairs Commission to join the campaign against sexual harassment of girls and young women at workplaces by “delisting any organisation found culpable of the menace just as she urged all stakeholders to join the advocacy.” Team Leader, Constituency Project Tracking Group, Independent Corrupt Practices, and other Related Offences Commission, Mr. Akibu Garba, reiterated that the commission regards sexual harassment as a corrupt practice, stressing the need for victims to know their rights and seek justice if the menace must be eradicated. He noted that the ICPC sexual harassment policy signed by the ICPC Chairman, Prof Bolaji Owasanoye, has a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment in its offices nationwide, with disciplinary actions spelt out.
