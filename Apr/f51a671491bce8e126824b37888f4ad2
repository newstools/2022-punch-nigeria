The families of passengers kidnapped from the bombed Abuja-Kaduna train are pleading with their abductors to allow them negotiate the release of their relations. Terrorists had attacked the train on March 28, leading to the death of no fewer than eight persons; 26 persons were injured while over 160 passengers, according to the Nigerian Railway Corporation, could not be accounted for. However, in a video last week, the terrorists said the government knew what they wanted, threatening to kill those in custody if their demands were not met. But addressing journalists on Thursday in Abuja, one of the abducted family members, Aliyu Mohammed, begged the terrorists to give room for families to negotiate the release of their loved ones. Mohammed, who lamented that no government agency had reached out to them since the incident, stated that the families, and not the government, would bear the brunt should anything untoward happen to the victims. He stated, “We are begging and pleading with the kidnappers to provide room for dialogue so we can negotiate the release of our loved ones.”   Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
