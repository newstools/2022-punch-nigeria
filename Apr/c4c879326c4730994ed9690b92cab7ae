The United States Government on Tuesday stressed the need for a peaceful and hitch-free governorship election in Ekiti State, which the people of the state and indeed Nigeria would be proud of. The Political/Economic Chief, US Mission in Nigeria, Mr Brandon Hudspeth, who said the US was interested in the Ekiti governorship poll, added, “Our expectation is that the election will take place in a free and credible manner.” Hudspeth, who spoke during a visit to Governor Kayode Fayemi, represented by his deputy, Bisi Egbeyemi, said officials of the US Mission in Nigeria were in Ekiti State to meet with the governorship candidates of the political parties, security officials and the Independent National Electoral Commission. He said, “Everyone wants peace and credible election. So, the US is a long-standing ally and partner of Nigeria to see that it’s an election that the people of the state will be proud of, and we also look forward to the campaigns. “It is clear that the political season is here; we have come to introduce ourselves to Your Excellency and the state and in the course of our stay, we will meet with candidates of the political parties, security officials and of course, INEC and so on.” Fayemi, who assured the US government of cooperation to ensure a peaceful, credible, free and fair governorship election in the state on June 18, said, “The conduct of credible election has become a global yardstick to measure development in any country.” The governor, who expressed delight with the arrival of the team in the state added, “Ekiti State Government has always enjoyed a productive partnership with the US Government in the key sectors of governance.” Copyright PUNCH.
