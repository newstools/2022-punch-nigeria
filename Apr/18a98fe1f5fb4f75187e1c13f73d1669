Ex-local government councillors who served in Kwara State between 1999 and 2019 have appealed to Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq to pay their entitlements. The councillors, under the aegis of Kwara State Ex-Councillors Forum, on Tuesday, lamented that the present administration had failed to pay the entitlement as promised three years ago. The forum’s spokesman, Fatai Adebayo, who said that about 1,850 people served during the period, urged the governor to approve and direct payment of their outstanding benefits. He said, “We are about 1,850 from 1999 till date. The arrears initially were over N3bn, but the previous governments paid out the amount in instalments. “We have met Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq over the issue, and the Kwara State House of Assembly leader, Magaji Olawoyin, but nothing has come out of it yet. We are using this opportunity to make our appeal further to consider us for payment. The total money we are expecting now is over N350 million. “The irony of it is that we have about 10 sitting members of the State House of Assembly as part of this forum, including the present Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress in the state, Alhaji Tajudeen Aro.” Copyright PUNCH.
