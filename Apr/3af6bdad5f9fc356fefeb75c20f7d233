The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, on Friday, stormed the Secretariat of the Peoples Democratic Party in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State capital, soliciting the support of party delegates, in the forthcoming PDP presidential primaries. Wike, who described the All Progressives Congress as the real ‘Satan” troubling Nigeria, said all he needed to defeat the ruling party and send it to eternal oblivion, was the PDP presidential ticket. The Rivers Governor further said he commanded the most endearing popularity, determination, and courage among all presidential aspirants, irrespective of parties, to save Nigeria from its present economic, agricultural, and security doldrums. He said, “I beg you (delegates) to give me the PDP presidential ticket. Currently, you are the most important in the country, that’s why I’m begging you. When I win the ticket, then I can talk to Nigerians. “What I need is the PDP presidential ticket to send APC packing. The APC is the Satan that is troubling Nigeria. We don’t have to allow the APC to continue in power anymore. Don’t be sentimental about it. “If you want to continue to suffer and be killed by bandits and kidnappers, then don’t give me the PDP ticket. But if you want all these nonsense to stop in Nigeria and want the best for our children, the youths and the women, then give me the PDP ticket. “It’s only me that can defeat the APC. Other aspirants don’t have what it takes. Therefore, I beg you to give me the PDP ticket and the moment you give it to me, then go to bed and sleep with your two eyes closed. This is because, I am the aspirant that can chase APC out of power, with the PDP presidential ticket.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
