Twitter, on Friday, announced the ban on ads that deny climate change science. Twitter’s announcement came on ‘World Earth Day’ as it tried to reject an unwanted takeover bid by billionaire Elon Musk, who had said he thought people should be able to say pretty much whatever they wanted on the platform. Twitter’s Global Sustainability Manager, Casey Junod, in a blog post, said, “Misleading advertisements on Twitter that contradict the scientific consensus on climate change is prohibited, in line with our inappropriate content policy. “We believe that climate denialism shouldn’t be monetised on Twitter, and that misrepresentative ads shouldn’t detract from important conversations about the climate crisis.” In 2021, Twitter introduced a topic feature to help users find conversations about climate change and rolled out hubs of “credible, authoritative” information on an array of high-profile topics including the science backing climate change. Junod said, “We recognise that misleading information about climate change can undermine efforts to protect the planet. “Now more than ever, meaningful climate action, from all of us, is critical.” However, despite how tempting, sealing deals with Musk’s wealth could be, Twitter had been skeptical about the consequences. Twitter was moving to prevent Musk from getting his hands on all of Twitter’s outstanding shares, expressing worries over the prospects of the company. Musk had made a bid of $43 billion for the one-to-many messaging app, citing better freedom of speech as a motivation. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
