The President, Major Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Monday, congratulated his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, 44, for winning his second term in office and making history as the only sitting leader of the country to return in two decades. Buhari’s congratulatory message was contained in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, titled, ‘President Buhari hails French President Emmanuel Macron’s victory’. The statement read in part, “President Buhari affirms that the iconic leadership style of the French President, who spent six months in Nigeria working as an intern at the French Embassy in 2002, continues to inspire a new generation of leaders and interest in politics and governance, starting from his country and beyond. “The President notes the warmth and friendliness that has redefined Nigeria/France relations since President Macron assumed office in 2017, paying an official visit to Nigeria in 2018, and consistently creating lines for improved ties in economy, culture, and security, which has culminated in France-Nigeria Business Council, African Cultures Season in 2020, and the France-Africa Summit.” Buhari, according to the statement, congratulated Macron, his wife, Brigitte Macron, friends, and political associates on the historic feat, and assured the French President of Nigeria’s support as he continues with his advocacy of humanising policies, promoting peace and stability, and encouraging development through innovation.
