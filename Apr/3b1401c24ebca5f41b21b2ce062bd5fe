Activities at the Rumuola office of the Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company were paralysed on Tuesday following a protest by nine communities which alleged power outage running into two years. Some of the communities included Orazi, Rumuochukwu, Rumuola, Chinda, Orowo, all in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of River State. Canopies were mounted in front of the PHED office with women dressed in black holding placards with different inscriptions and demanding that power be restored to the area. They said for two years the communities had been suffering blackout, even when they paid their bills, adding that the situation had affected business and caused them hardship. One of the protesters, Tony Onuowu, said, “We have been here since morning, and our demand is simple. We want the PHED to restore power to us. It was not like this in the past, but the new management changed everything. “We are calling on the government to look into our plight. No business is fully operational, and our houses are vacant because tenants are packing out in droves. “This land comprises nine communities. We have employed dialogue and engaged in a series of meetings, but nothing has changed. “So, we want those at the helms of affairs to come to our aid.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
