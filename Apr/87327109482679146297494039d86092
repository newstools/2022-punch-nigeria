The All Progressives Congress on Sunday vowed that it would not allow the opposition’s Peoples Democratic Party take back Ebonyi State. The party also said it was targeting to win five South Eastern states in the 2023 general elections starting from Abia and Enugu States. The National Vice Chairman (Southeast) of the party, Dr Ijeomah Arodiogbu, stated this during party’s inaugural zonal meeting at the zonal Secretariat of the party in Enugu. Arodiogbu, while addressing journalists expressed satisfaction with the judgement by the Appeal Court sitting in Enugu which dismissed the suit filed to remove Ebonyi State governor, Chief David Umahi. He said the party was happy with the outcome of the judgement and that it was part of its responsibility to defend all the states under the party’s control in the region. “Ebonyi is one of such states and we cannot let people come in through the back door and harass the governor” Arodiogbu said. Arodiogbu maintained that the zonal office of the party has a target in the 2023 election which is to win all states in the Southeast, adding that the goal cannot be achieved without the support of the people. He said, “We are appealing to our brothers and sisters in the Southeast to support the government at the centre because it has brought massive infrastructure to the zone. There are alot of good things to benefit if we support the party,” he said.
