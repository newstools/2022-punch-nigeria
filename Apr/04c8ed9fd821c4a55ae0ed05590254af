The League Management Company, on Sunday, banned Kano Pillars Football Club from playing all their home games in Kano for the rest of the 2021/22 Nigeria Professional Football League season. The Sai Masu Gida were ordered to play the remainder of their home games at the Moshood Abiola Stadium in Abuja. The decision was the outcome of Pillars fans violence in Kano against Katsina United FC during a recent match at the Sani Abacha, Kano. In a statement, issued on Sunday, the LMC imposed a N9 million fine on the club, over the brazen breach of the NPFL rules. The club will lose three points from the already accrued points, just as the LMC also banned the Sani Abacha Stadium, Kano from hosting NPFL games till further notice. Also, the league management body ordered Kano Pillars to repair or replace the damaged Katsina United FC team bus, which was vandalised by Pillars fans. PUNCH Sports Extra had earlier reported that Kano Pillars were held to 0-0 by Katsina United before the rampage of the home fans in the 82nd minute of play, a situation that informed the decision of the referee to suspend the game. Meanwhile, Kano Pillars currently sits 13th on the NPFL log with 27 points. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
