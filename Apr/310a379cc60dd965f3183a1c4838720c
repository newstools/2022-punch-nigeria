The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has reportedly arrested popular socialite, Pascal Okechukwu, known better as Cubana Chief Priest for alleged tax fraud and money laundering. Okechukwu, who was arrested at the Lagos airport on Thursday, is being quizzed by anti-graft operatives while the agency was said to be on the hunt for his accomplices. It was gathered that only his wife and family members were allowed to see him since he was taken into custody. Our correspondent learnt that he may be granted administrative bail this week. The EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, could not be reached for comment on Sunday. Okechukwu’s arrest is coming weeks after his acolyte, Obinna Iyiegbu, known as Obi Cubana, was detained by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency for alleged drug dealing. Copyright PUNCH.
