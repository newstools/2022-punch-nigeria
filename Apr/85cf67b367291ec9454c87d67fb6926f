A one-time Nigeria’s High Commissioner to Malaysia, Ibrahim Abdullahi, has decried inequalities and lack of justice in the country, adding that legal system is expected to give the citizens peace of mind. He stated that Nigerians should always obey the law, describing law offenders as outlaws. Abdullahi, a former Minister of Education, Science and Technology, who made these remarks in an interview with our correspondent in Gombe, said Nigerians should be proud of their country. He warned that the peace of the country should not be compromised by whatever standard. Abdullahi said, “We have to draw the attention of the government to the inequalities and lack of justice that is being practiced in the society. We can’t run away because we belong to Nigeria and it is a question of our country. If the legal system can’t give us as citizens rest of mind, then we are in trouble.” The former minister called on Nigerians to pray for peaceful co-existence in the country, adding that in whatever language, God would answer. “On my own personal decision to pray to my creator, Allah, I’m urging all Nigerians by whatever name they call Allah, because in all languages, you have Allah. We should pray to Him to restore peace and tranquility in the country to improve our economic progress. “I’m appealing to Muslims and non-Muslims and I’m urging them to use whatever name to speak to Allah to restore peace. We have every reason to be proud of our country Nigeria. The fact remains that there are inequalities and injustice.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
