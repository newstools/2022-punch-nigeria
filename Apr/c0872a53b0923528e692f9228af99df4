Suspected terrorists in the early hours of Saturday have attacked the house of the Plateau State Commissioner for Environment, Usman Bamaiyi, located in the Gindiri community, Mangu Local Government Area of the state. Sources said that Bamaiyi, who is also seeking to represent the people of Mangu/Bokkos federal constituency at the National Assembly in 2023, was not around when the gunmen stormed his house at about 2am. However, it was gathered that during the attack, the gunmen in large numbers broke into his apartment and abducted his wife and daughter. A resident of Gindiri who confirmed the attack to The PUNCH in Jos said, “Some heavily armed men came to Gindiri last night around 2am. They went straight to the house of the State Commissioner for Environment. The sound of gunshots fired by the gunmen was too much. When they eventually left, we discovered that they took the commissioner’s wife away alongside his daughter.” The Police Public Relations Officer in the State, Ubah Ogaba, also confirmed the abduction of the commissioner’s wife and daughter. According to him, “When we got the information around 2:30 am, we quickly mobilised our tactical team to the area. At the moment our men are working to rescue the victims and arrest the perpetrators.” Some gunmen had in December last year abducted the paramount ruler of Gindiri, His Royal Highness Charles Mato, after they attacked his palace. The monarch was, however, released by his abductors after they allegedly demanded and collected a ransom. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
