A group, Indomitable Tinubu Support Organisation, has commended the Lagos State Governor’s Advisory Council for its endorsement of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for a second term. The group gave this commendation in a statement released and signed by its Director-General, Abdoulbaq Balogun, on Wednesday. The statement read, “The pass mark given to Governor Sanwo-Olu for staying true to the developmental agenda of Lagos by members of the GAC is a brilliant testimony of his quality stewardship and truly well deserved. “The Lagos developmental master plan guiding the Sanwo-Olu’s administration was designed by Asiwaju’s administration in ensuring a sustainable smart city, ranking with the best cities of the world. “This sterling achievement recorded by staying true to this master plan is a testimony to Asiwaju Tinubu’s vision to discover, empower and support brilliant minds, earning him the honour of being referred to as ‘builder of people.’’ “We want to assure citizens that Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu will complete all outstanding projects and deliver more dividends of democracy.”  Copyright PUNCH.
