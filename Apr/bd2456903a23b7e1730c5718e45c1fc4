The National Chairman of the governing party, All Progressives Congress, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, Wednesday in Abuja loathed some sitting and former governors trying to divide the party. Adamu disclosed this in his remarks at the 11th National Executive Committee meeting of the APC which was held at the Transcorp Hilton, Abuja. Noting that state governors are leaders of the party in their various states, Adamu said the APC constitution does but have provision for dual leadership in the states. He, however, noted that past governors are leaders in their own rights, urging serving governors to accord them all the necessary respect. Details later… Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
