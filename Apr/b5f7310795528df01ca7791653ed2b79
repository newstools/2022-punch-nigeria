The All Progressives Grand Alliance has debunked the report making the rounds of an assassination attempt on the Anambra State Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo. The party said nothing had happened since Soludo became the state governor, describing the report as an orchestrated plot by “mischief makers” to instill fear in the people’s minds “just as it is condemnable.” Addressing journalists in Awka on Monday, the National Coordinator of APGA Media Warriors Forum, Mr. Chinedu Obigwe, maintained that the governor would not yield to the “evil wishes” of the criminal elements who want to hold the state spellbound. Obigwe said the hoodlums only launched a “hit and run attack” on the Isuofia community and not the governor’s convoy. He urged the general public to disregard the twisted report just as he reminded the media that they have a role in eradicating criminality in Anambra and the South-East region. Copyright PUNCH.
