The Zamfara State Police Command has presented cheques of N4.2m to the next-of-kin of seven policemen killed by terrorists in the state. The Commissioner of Police, Ayuba Elkanah, presented the cheques on behalf of the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, as part of the IGP’s family insurance welfare scheme given to the families of slain policemen and officers who died in active service. Elkanah said the assistance would go a long way in alleviating the suffering faced by the families of the slain police officers. The CP also assured the IGP that personnel of the command would continue to put in their best to ensure peace, security, and safety of Zamfara State and Nigeria as a whole. He urged the beneficiaries to use the money judiciously. According to him, the command received similar cheques from the Inspector-General of Police seven times in the last five months and presented the same to the beneficiaries. “This will serve as a morale booster to the serving members of the force to continue to discharge their duties effectively,” the CP added.
