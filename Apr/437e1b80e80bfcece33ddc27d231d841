Mr. Kolapo Alimi, ex-Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs during the tenure of the former governor of Osun State, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, has said that the jingle announcing his defection to the Peoples Democratic Party is not genuine. A jingle that went viral on the social media, obtained by The PUNCH on Thursday, had claimed that Alimi would defect to the PDP alongside his 25,000 supporters from across the state. The jingle which eulogised Alimi’s political prowess, also said that the formal event where he would be received into the PDP by the party’s governorship candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke, would hold on Thursday, March 23, 2022. However, when contacted for further clarification, Alimi, who is the current Secretary of The Osun Progressives, a faction in the All Progressives Congress in Osun, backed by Aregbesola, simply said, “for now, we have a tendency, we have leaders who are talking to us, guiding us on what to do. “I will always respect our leaders. Somebody made the jingle and we told him it was not yet time. When you listen to it, the jingle mentioned 23rd March which has passed, and it was released on April 11. In that wise, it is clear the jingle was not genuine.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
