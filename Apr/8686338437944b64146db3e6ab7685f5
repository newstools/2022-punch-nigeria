Borno State Governor, Prof Babagana Zulum, has warned fish traders against any business deals with terrorist groups, insisting that such can support the funding to Boko Haram/ Islamic State in West Africa Province and reinforce the reign of terror on them. The governor gave the warning at the weekend during his visit to Monguno, where he supervised the distribution of N275m alongside bags of food items and textiles to over 90,000 Internally Deisplaced Persons and vulnerable members of the host communities. The governor, who during his trip directed the release of five vehicles and a business grant as stimulus to fish marketers, stated, “I warn you not to be involved with any illicit transaction that can jeopardise the security of our people. Anyone caught associating with criminal elements will blame himself.” Zulum urged the traders to cooperate with security agencies by providing information about suspicious activities relating to insurgents. The governor’s lifeline to the fishermen is aimed at enhancing the trading of dried fish previously suspended as a result of the activities of Boko Haram insurgents. Economic activities in Borno State were disrupted due to Boko Haram attacks on security forces and communities which led to the displacement of millions of people. Before the insurgency, which disrupted business activities in most communities in the state, dry fish was commercially supplied to other parts of Nigeria and neighbouring countries. Zulum, since 2019, has directed the disbursement of billions of naira aimed at supporting business owners whose source of livelihood were crippled by over a decade conflict in the     North-East region.
