Terrorists suspected to be members of the Islamic State of West African Province have attacked the Damboa town of Borno State. A security source, who confirmed the attack, said the terrorists attacked the town around 1:00 am on Wednesday. “They parked their motorcycles behind the trench dug around the town and moved in on their foot,” the source said. He explained that they burnt parts of a primary healthcare facility aside from the town and parts of Technical Girls College, Damboa. A Civilian JTF also said two of their members sustained injuries from gunshots. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
