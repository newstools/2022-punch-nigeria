An Osogbo-based businessman, Ibrahim Taofeeq Kayode, eyeing the All Progressives Congress ticket for Osogbo Federal Constituency has denied being an internet fraudster. Speaking to newsmen in Osogbo, Kayode said he came from a business background and learnt the rudiments of trading from his parents who were both successful business owners. He said, “With the influence of my parent in society, I will be a bastard if I venture into internet fraud or yahoo yahoo. My mother is a successful businesswoman, likewise my father. I inherited hard work from them through trading which they are involved in. “It is a big rumour that I am into yahoo yahoo. Some of my political rivals just want to smear my reputation. I am an entrepreneur, who made landmark effects in real estate, construction, water supply, automobiles, and hospitality.” On his ambition, Kayode said he was seeking an APC ticket to make a difference and sought the support of the delegates and party leaders for a victorious outing at the primary election. If elected, Kayode assured of massive development and promised to work with Governor Adegboyega Oyetola to further improve the well-being of his constituents. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
