A former presidential aspirant for the Guinea-Bissau football federation, Benelívio Insalí, says the Super Eagles are the only team they fear in Group A of their 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. The Djurtus have been paired in Group  A along with Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Sao Tome and Principe. Guinea-Bissau who lost 2-0 to Nigeria in their final group game of the 2021 AFCON in Cameroon will face the Eagles in a doubleheader affair in September  and Insali believes of the other three teams in the group, the eagles pose a bigger problem to their qualification hopes. “Guinea-Bissau has only one opponent, which is Nigeria, the teams from São Tomé and Príncipe/Mauritius are opponents that will guarantee us six points. “With the Sierra Leone team, Guinea-Bissau has an obligation to win at home and seek a draw in the opponent’s stronghold, which will be a positive result, since in the group two teams can qualify. “There must be a way and criteria for calling up the national team players, calling the elite footballers, because the two opponents, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, have players with a lot of muscle mass, height and weight, with a very tight schedule”, he said. The top two teams in the group will qualify for the competition. The West African nation has qualified for the last three AFCON and will be hoping to make their fourth appearance in Ivory Coast.
