Lorient striker, Terem Moffi, will be aiming to grab his eighth goal of the season when they welcome bottom-place Metz to the Stade du Moustoir on Wednesday (today) for a Ligue 1 clash. Lorient are currently 16th, two points adrift of relegation zone, and a win would be crucial in helping them remain in the French topflight for the second consecutive season, after narrowly escaping the drop last season, thanks to goals from the Nigerian. Although he is yet to reach the heights of his 2020/21 campaign for the club, when he finished the league with 14 goals, he is still the club’s top scorer this season with seven goals and four assists in 31 league games. Lorient have intensified their chase for survival, recording two wins, one draw and two losses in their last five games. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
