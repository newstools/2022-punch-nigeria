NO fewer than 2,000 physically challenged and less privileged women have received empowerment items from the wife of Gombe State governor, Asma’u Yahaya. Yahaya said the support would help them to fend for themselves during the current economic hardship bedeviling the country. Commencing the distribution of the empowerment tools at the Women Centre, the governor’s wife reiterated  government’s commitment towards ensuring even and equitable distribution of dividends of democracy to the people. The items included tricycles, grinding and sewing machines. She said, “The first lady’s office will continue to assist women  with what it takes to improve their livelihood by developing their potentials to become financially self reliant.” Also speaking, Commissioner for Women’s Affairs, Mrs Naomi Awak, commended the first lady for her passion in helping the poor and vulnerable, “by not only putting food on their table, but providing them with requisite skills and knowledge on how to make ends meet.” The commissioner assured the governor’s wife of full support of Gombe women whom she said were solidly behind the government of Muhammadu Yahaya for carrying them along in all strata of government, thereby giving them a sense of belonging. In the same vain, the state APC women leader, Lumbi Abubakar, lauded the first lady for her continued assistance, assuring that the women would remain strongly united. “Shun all rumours and political propaganda, so that together, we will stand for Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya’s government in years to come,” Abubakar added.
