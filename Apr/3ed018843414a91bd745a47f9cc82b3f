The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has expressed concern over the continuous killings in Kaduna State, Nigeria’s rising debt profile, crude oil theft, amongst other national challenges. The octogenarian preacher said this on Sunday at the monthly Thanksgiving Service of the Church. He lamented that though Nigeria was able to settle its debt during then President Olusegun Obasanjo’s administration, the nation has plunged deeply into the mire of debt. The 80-year-old cleric also said he is more concerned about praying for Nigeria to get out of its depressing throes than the 2023 elections. He said as a matter of fact, God has not spoken to him about next year’s elections yet, adding that God spoke to him about the 2019 elections more than a year to the election but the case has not been so with the 2023 election. He quickly added that God might still speak to him about the 2023 general elections but He has not spoken to him yet. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
