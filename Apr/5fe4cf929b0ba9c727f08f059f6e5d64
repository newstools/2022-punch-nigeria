Considering the rising spate of insecurity in the land, the Southern Kaduna Christian Leaders Association, has inaugurated a four-man committee for this year’s Southern Kaduna Prayer Summit. The prayer summit, which is an annual event, was not held for two years due to COVID-19 restrictions. Inaugurating the committee on Wednesday in Kafanchan, shortly after a brief handover ceremony of the new leadership, the association’s Chairman, Dr. Emmanuel Kure, tasked members to put in their best to ensure the success of the summit. He described the prayer summit as crucial, saying prayers would be offered for the restoration and emancipation of the land. Kure thanked the outgone leadership of the association for the sacrifices they made during their time and solicited the support of members for the new leadership to succeed. He called on members, especially the executives, to rededicate themselves to the cause for the spiritual growth and development of the land and her people.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
