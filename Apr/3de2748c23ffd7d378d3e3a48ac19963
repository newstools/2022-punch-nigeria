The Senate, on Tuesday, has extended the expiration date of the capital component of the 2021 Appropriation Act by three months, from March 31 to May 31, 2022. The extension was sequel to the passage of an executive bill seeking to amend the Act. The Senate had suspended Rule 78(1) of the Senate Standing Orders 2022 (as amended), before considering the bill, to enable the lawmakers to expeditiously introduce and pass the bill. Consequently, the bill sponsored by the Majority Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, passed first, second and third readings at a sitting. Abdullahi recalled that the 2022 Appropriation Act was amended to extend the implementation year from December 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022. The Majority Leader explained that the extension of the budget period was based on the need to complete ongoing projects nearing completion. He said, “As you are aware, the 2021 virement of the aggregate sum of N276bn was approved for several MDAs by the National Assembly in December 2021 along with 100 percent release of the 2021 capital budget of the MDAs. “A significant portion of the releases to the MDAs has been utilised following the extension to 31st March, 2022. “In view of the critical importance of some key projects nearing completion, it is expedient to grant further extension of the expiration clause to avoid compounding the problem of abandoned projects given that some of the projects were not provided for in the 2022 budget hence the need to extend the implementation year form 31 March, 2022 to 31st May, 2022.” The bill to amend the 2021 Appropriation Act was, thereafter, passed after its report was considered and adopted by the Committee on Supply.
