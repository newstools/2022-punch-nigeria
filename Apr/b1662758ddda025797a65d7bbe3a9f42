A governorship aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, Ifeanyi Odii, has said wealth creation, mass employment of youths, social integration and economic prosperity would be the focus of his administration, if elected governor of Ebonyi State in 2023. He said the initiatives and programmes that would be introduced by his administration would signal a new dawn of hope for the people of the state. Odii stated this while addressing his supporters in his country home in Isu-Achara community, in the Onicha Local Government Area of the state. He lamented that residents of the state had suffered a lot and vowed to ameliorate their sufferings if he became the governor. He said, “I have always had the urge to work and plan for the betterment of our people’s condition. In all my efforts, I see the whole of Ebonyi State as one united entity without clannish divisions. “I urge you all to join me in seeing Ebonyi as a place of fellow brothers with a common destiny. “I am prepared to put my best in defence of the interests of the people and I am convinced that God shall see us through.” Copyright PUNCH.
