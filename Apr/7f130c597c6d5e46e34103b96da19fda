The Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, has condemned in strong terms the recent bomb attack in Iware, Ardo Kola Local Government Area of the state in which several lives were lost and several others injured. In a press statement issued in Jalingo and signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Bala Dan-Abu, Ishaku described the attack as barbaric, wicked and an act of unprovoked aggression against innocent people. The Governor’s statement comes a few minutes after the Islamic State of West Africa Province claimed responsibility for the attack. According to the Reuters News Agency, the terror group in a statement posted late on Wednesday on a Telegram messaging channel used to distribute its propaganda, described those who detonated the bomb in the market as “soldiers of the caliphate in central Nigeria.” The ISWAP statement said the attack had struck “a gathering of infidel Christians” and expressed satisfaction that the drinking spot had been damaged. It did not break down the casualty figure into dead and injured. But the State government in the statement said security agencies have been directed to go after the perpetrators of the heinous crime and to make them pay for their sins. While expressing sympathy to the families of those killed in the attack, the Governor promised government assistance for those injured and receiving treatment in hospitals. Ishaku urged the people of the state to be vigilant always and to report strange visitors to their communities promptly to security agencies and traditional authorities in their communities.
