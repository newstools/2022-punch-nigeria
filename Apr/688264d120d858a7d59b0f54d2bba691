Protesters in Sri Lanka have taken to the streets on Tuesday as the country grappled with a fuel price hike and shortage of petrol and diesel. The protesters were also demonstrating outside the president’s office for the eleventh consecutive day. Protests were launched in several towns, blocking off public transport including train services, and disrupting travel to schools and offices, a senior police officer said. On Monday, the biggest fuel price hike was put in place, raising diesel prices by 64 percent and petrol by 33 percent per litre. The protesters are demanding the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is the president’s brother. The economic crisis in Sri Lanka had meant a lack of the United States dollars, which had affected imports. Last week, the country suspended the repayment of all foreign debts until further notice. It was, however, gathered that a Sri Lankan delegation, led by the Finance Minister, Ali Sabry, was meeting with representatives of the International Monetary Fund in Washington. NAN
