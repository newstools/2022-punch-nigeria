Super Falcons coach, Randy Waldrum, has dispelled media reports (not in The PUNCH) that Barcelona Femini forward, Asisat Oshoala, has been stripped of the team’s captaincy, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The American insisted that there had been “no fallout” between him and Oshoala or any member of his backroom staff. In Oshoala’s absence, Onome Ebi has captained the team in their last three games, fueling speculations that she may have been stripped of the armband. “There are no issues with Asisat and I don’t know where the reports emanated from that she had been stripped of the team’s captaincy,” Waldrum told The PUNCH. “Those reports are incorrect and not pleasant. “She remains the captain of the team and whenever we decide otherwise the entire backroom staff will meet and agree on who takes the armband. “Asisat is recovering well and you know when a talented player like her gets injured and is out for a significant period of time, it’s always difficult for them mentally and psychologically. But she is surrounded by a great club and good people who support her a lot from here. She knows she’s a big part of what we are doing here moving forward.” Meanwhile, Oshoala is expected to resume full training with Barcelona next month ahead of the 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations billed for Morocco from July 2 to 23. She is currently undergoing rehabilitation from the thigh injury she sustained while training with the Falcons in February prior to their WAFCON qualifying play-off against Ivory Coast.
