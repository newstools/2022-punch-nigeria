Ilawe Ekiti, an Ekiti State community renowned for large-scale cultivation of banana and plantain, has concluded arrangements to float a processing company for the agricultural product. Captain Kunle Olayiwola, the Chairman of the 10th Coronation Anniversary Committee of the Alawe of Ilawe Ekiti, Oba Adebanji Alabi, said that while sons and daughters of the community were willing to provide funds for the take-off of the banana/plantain company, the state government had assured of providing enabling environment. Olayiwola, who spoke at Ilawe on Thursday during a press conference heralding activities for the Alawe’s 10th coronation anniversary which would climax on Saturday next week, said, the community would hold a N300m fundraising for the production company on the occasion.
