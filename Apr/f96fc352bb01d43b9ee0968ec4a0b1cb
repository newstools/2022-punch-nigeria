The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has, on Thursday, ordered his forces not to storm the last remaining Ukrainian stronghold in the besieged city of Mariupol, but to block it “so that not even a fly comes through.” The Kremlin leader gave the order to Russian Defence Minister, Sergei Shoigu, during a broadcast on state television, describing the effort by Russian forces to capture Mariupol as a success. “Completing the military task of liberating Mariupol is a great achievement, I congratulate you.” Russian forces “must think about preserving the life and health of our soldiers and officers. “There is no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities. Block off this industrial area so a fly cannot get through,” he said, in a meeting with Shoigu. It was gathered that Ukrainian forces were still in charge of the Azovstal plant in the southeastern port city, which Shoigu said would take his troops three or four days to take over it. Sergei Shoigu had also said that the rest of Mariupol, beyond the sprawling Azovstal steel plant, where Ukrainian forces were holding had been taken over. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
