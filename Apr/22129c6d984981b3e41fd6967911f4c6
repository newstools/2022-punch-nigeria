Four persons have been reportedly killed by thunderbolt in Ago Dada community in the Akure North Local Government Area of Ondo State. It was gathered that the deceased, said to be youths, were killed when the thunderbolt struck during a rainfall in the village. A source said the incident caused panic in the village as residents wondered why the youth, who were non-indigenes of the area, died under such a circumstance. It was gathered that some traditionalists moved to the scene to perform some rites for the burial of the victims. A resident in the community told City Round on condition of anonymity that a disagreement ensued between the indigenes and non-indigenes in the village over the incident which occurred on Wednesday. “The non-indigenes of the village challenged the indigenes on why thunderbolt killed only settlers. The matter almost resulted in a free fall all between the two groups but it was later resolved,” the resident said. Confirming the development to our correspondent, the state police spokesperson, Mrs Funmilayo Odunlami, said the incident didn’t lead to a breakdown of law and order. “I can confirm to you that four youths were killed by a thunderbolt in the village. But there was no protest leading to another death in the village. Maybe there was an argument when the families of those affected wanted to pick up the remains of the victims for burial. It was a painful thing,” Odunlami added.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
