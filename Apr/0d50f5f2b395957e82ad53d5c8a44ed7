He was latwer appointed the Minister of Youth, Minister of Information, and later the Minister of Information and Communications, during the second term of President Olusegun Obasanjo (2003–2007). He contested a seat in the Senate for the Enugu East Senatorial District but lost to Senator Gilbert Nnaji.
