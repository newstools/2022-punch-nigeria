Ekiti State Commissioner for Health, Dr Oyebanji Filani, said on Thursday that the state government would incorporate 500,000 citizens into the State Health Insurance Scheme with women and children below five years as major beneficiaries. Filani who spoke at Ikole Ekiti during a town hall meeting commemorating 2022 World Health Day with the theme, ‘Our Community, Our Health’, disclosed that the SHIS scheme would be undertaken under a new programme called “Ilera Wa”, He said, “The government of Dr Kayode Fayemi is working hard to capture a total of 500,000 citizens under the scheme so that they can get treatment at affordable rates. “The women and children below age five will be major beneficiaries because they are the most vulnerable groups in society. We won’t spare any effort to reduce mortality and morbidity rates. Making healthcare more affordable and accessible remains our focus with SHIS,” he said. The commissioner said that the state government had also given a marching order to doctors and nurses in the state-owned health facilities to give expeditious treatments to any patient brought on emergency to safeguard citizens’ lives, not minding protocols of registration.
