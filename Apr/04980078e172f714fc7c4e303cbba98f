Following Super Eagles’ failure to qualify for the 2022 Qatar World Cup and their shock exit from the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, former England striker of Nigerian descent, John Fashanu, says Nigerian football is on the decline. Last month, the Eagles missed out on the Mundial on the away goal rule after a 1-1 draw with Ghana after two legs. The three-time African champions also exited the 2022 AFCON in Cameroon in the round of 16 in January. Also, at the club level, Nigerian clubs have been unable to win either of the CAF Champions League or Confederation Cup since Enyimba last did in 2014. Speaking with The PUNCH, the former Wimbledon star said, “At a time when everything in the country is looking like it is declining, it would be very hard and difficult for me to tell a lie that Nigerian football is doing fantastically well in Africa. “Things are very bad at the moment and different situations are taking their toll on every sector and when players are happy it will translate on the pitch. “A lot of people are criticising the players for not giving their best, which is for sure, but at the moment, our football is in decline and that doesn’t mean to say things cannot change.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
