The Kogi State Chairman of the All Progressive Congress, Abdullahi Bello, has said that the party has not endorsed, chosen or imposed any aspirant for elective offices in the state. He, therefore, called on all interested aspirants to come forward and present themselves and convince party members of their suitability for the offices they were aspiring to occupy. In a statement on Thursday in Lokoja, Bello stated that at no time was any aspirant to any office endorsed, chosen, or imposed. “The party is hereby encouraging every eligible member of our great party who wish to contest for any position to come all out, present themselves to the party members and convince them of their suitability for such office. “All Progressive Congress is a political party anchored on progressivism philosophy, it is a party with a hallmark of internal democracy, a party of equal opportunity, the playing field is level for all; the rules will be applied equally, no one will be favoured nor will anyone be disadvantaged, the party has no preferred candidate for any office what so ever. “Prelude to the general election, our candidates will emerge from the process approved by the constitution of the party and the electoral law, the law is clear on the mode of primaries for political parties to choose their candidates for the elections; we have direct and indirect primary and consensus option as spelt out, however, it is the tradition of our party to encourage consensus candidate among the aspirants themselves where practicable, this is to minimize misgivings, but the party will never impose any candidate for any elective office(s).” Copyright PUNCH.
