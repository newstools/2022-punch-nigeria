Ahead of the 2023 general election, the Ondo State chapter of the Social Democratic Party has enjoined the youths to go out massively to join political parties to enable them be part of the decision-making process. The SDP said the time had come for the youths to actively participate in politics so as to change the mantra and be part of “the paddlers of the nation’s canoe.” The state chairman of the party, Stephen Adewale, gave the charge in Akure, while speaking on the state of the nation and of the party. According to him, youths of Nigeria had all it takes to take over the affairs of the country, hence the need for them to involve in the nation’s politics. He said, “Nigeria is what it is today because the youths have been side-lined and made to suffer economically and educationally by the older generation. “I wish to encourage the youths at this moment to be partakers in decision-making process of our fatherland and paddlers of the nation’s canoe by getting involved in politics, given our strength and intellectual potential.” Also speaking, the secretary of the party, Bola Aina, stated that the party had opened its doors to well-meaning Nigerian youths who wish and believe that the country would improve, disclosing that the party was revalidating and recruiting new members. “We are revalidating and recruiting new members for correct and adequate data records, which will, of course, make the party much more viable than previously”, he said.
