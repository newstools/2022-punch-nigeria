The Lagos State Government has said Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has consulted with stakeholders on the resumption of tolls at the Lekki-Ikoyi Bridge by the Lekki Concession Company, in order to meet their list of concessions. The state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, disclosed this, according to a statement on Thursday, during a MITV ‘Lagos State in focus’ programme. Omotoso also noted that Sanwo-Olu was endorsed by the Governance Advisory Council because he has built on the projects initiated by his predecessors. He said, “On the planned resumption of tolling by the Lekki Concession Company at the Ikoyi Link Bridge toll gate, consultations with the stakeholders are still ongoing. The consultation is to seek the understanding of stakeholders and all those involved. “A list of concessions the stakeholders requested for has been tabled. The company has financial obligations, which must be discharged so that future opportunities for investments in the state, will not be affected. “The Governance Advisory Council, the highest decision-making body of the All Progressives Congress in Lagos, endorsed Sanwo-Olu for re-election, but this will not make the governor shift his focus away from the state’s numerous projects. “The GAC must have based their decision to endorse Sanwo-Olu on the future of Lagos, as the governor has been building on what his predecessors have done. The governor is a man of vision, good character and a good party man. The decision to let Sanwo-Olu contest for another term is not about personal glorification; the aim is to deliver for the people of Lagos.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
