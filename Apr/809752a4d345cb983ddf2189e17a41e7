Benue State House of Assembly on Thursday approved the nomination of Terver Akase as Special Adviser. Akase last September resigned his appointment as the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Samuel Ortom to pursue his governorship ambition. Unfortunately, the zoning arrangements did not favour him. The party leaders and stakeholders from Tiv extraction had zoned the governorship to Jechira where he (Akase) hails from but the micro zoning knocked him out. Ortom had last week declared that he would reabsorb all his appointees not favoured with the party zoning arrangements. Speaking with our correspondent, Akase confirmed the approval of his nomination by the state assembly. He said, “The House of Assembly just approved of my nomination this morning.” Copyright PUNCH.
