Grammy-winning Nigerian singer, Damini Ogulu, popularly known as Burna Boy, visited the United Nations Headquarters in New York, ahead of his sold-out show at Madison Square Garden, in the same city. Burna Boy, who went in the company of his mum and manager, Bose Ogulu, met with the UN Deputy Secretary-General, Nigeria’s Amina Mohammed, during the visit. Mohammed shared a picture of the visit on her Twitter page on Thursday morning, as she hailed the singer for inspiring young people with his talent. She wrote, “I had the opportunity to welcome my compatriot @burnaboy here at the @UN HQ. “Burna continues to inspire young people around the world with his amazing talents.”  The singer also took to his Instagram story to share clips of the visit. Burna Boy is the first African artiste to sell out the popular event centre in New York. A record-breaker, Burna Boy’s last album, Twice As Tall, which was released in August 2020, earned the singer his first Grammy award win. In February, the singer was named the first-ever African artiste to hit 200 million streams on music streaming platform, Boomplay. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
