IBM has unveiled IBM® z16™, an innovation designed to enable clients to analyse real-time transactions at scale. According to the firm, its product has an integrated on-chip AI accelerator that delivers latency optimised inferencing, adding that the innovation is best for mission-critical workloads such as credit card, healthcare and financial transactions. In a statement, General Manager, IBM Africa Growth Markets, Julia Carvalho, said, “IBM z16 is an essential component for organisations across the African continent as they accelerate their digital transformation journey. “By simplifying hybrid cloud adoption, modernising applications, and keeping data safe, encrypted, and resilient — clients can have the cloud they want, with the privacy and security they need. IBM z16 delivers breakthrough technologies for AI and cyber resiliency — making it a crucial platform for any digital transformation.” The firm added, “For the first time, banks can analyse fraud during transactions on a massive scale: IBM z16 can process 300 billion inference requests per day with just one millisecond of latency. “For consumers, this could mean reducing the time and energy required to handle fraudulent transactions on their credit card. For both merchants and card issuers, this could mean a reduction in revenue loss as consumers could avoid the frustration associated with false declines where they might turn to other cards for future transactions.”  Copyright PUNCH.
