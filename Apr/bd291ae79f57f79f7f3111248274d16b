Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency have arrested some youths for organising a cannabis party in the Asokoro area of the Federal Capital Territory. The party was reportedly organised by a group of ladies on Wednesday night. PUNCH Metro gathered that the youth were having a nice time when the NDLEA officers invaded the venue of the revelling. A tweep with the handle @ezioimmauel, said about a hundred suspects were arrested. “In the police station right now. Was at a 4/20 party in Asokoro and they busted it. Asokoro, Abuja. There’s hundreds of us in custody right now. Everyone’s still accounted for I think,” he wrote. The FCT Police Public Relations Officer, Josephine Adeh, could not be reached for comments. A statement on Thursday by the spokesperson for the NDLEA, Femi Babafemi, said about 200 attendees, including three young ladies who organised the party, were being profiled and interviewed. He said bottles of the new drink had been taken for a lab analysis. Babafemi said, “The hotel was raided around 8.18pm on Wednesday, April 20, following actionable intelligence that some youths were planning to hold a hemp party at the hotel. “Quantities of cannabis sativa were recovered from the pockets and bags of those arrested at the hemp party. The audacious party no doubt is part of attempts by some elements to create a drug subculture in the Nigerian social space. “The NDLEA will, however, continue to work with other security agencies and relevant stakeholders to ensure abuse of illicit substances is not allowed to get entrenched in the country under any guise.” Copyright PUNCH.
