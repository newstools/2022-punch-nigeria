The national electricity grid collapsed again on Friday evening, making it the third time the grid had collapsed within the space of one month. Some power distribution companies confirmed the development in separate messages on Friday evening. The Abuja Electricity Distribution Company stated that the collapse had resulted in power outage in its area of operation, which covered about five states. In a tweet via its official Twitter handle, the AEDC said, “Please be informed that there has just been a national grid collapse causing an outage in our franchise areas. “We apologise for the inconvenience caused and appeal that you bear with us while we await restoration from the TCN (Transmission Company of Nigeria). We regret all inconvenience caused.” Also, Eko Electricity Distribution Company said the grid collapse affected its entire network. “Good evening everyone. We regret to inform you that the current outage affecting our entire network is due to system collapse,” EKEDC stated. It added, “TCN team is working to resolve it as soon as possible. Sincere apologies for the inconveniences caused. Please, bear with us.” Last month, Nigeria’s power grid collapsed twice and worsened the energy crisis nationwide, as Nigerians had to contend with fuel scarcity and power outages. The collapse of the grid on Friday evening, again caused blackout across the country, as homes and businesses were without power to run their activities. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
