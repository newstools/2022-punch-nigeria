Barely a few hours after his hat-trick in Genk’s 5-0 victory over Eupen on Sunday, Nigeria international Paul Onuachu says he hopes to score his 20th league goal in the final game of the Jupiler League regular season against Seraing. Onuach scored a hat-trick in their convincing win as they continue to salvage what has been a disappointing season. The Smurfs, as they are fondly called, have failed to reach the heights of last season as they currently occupy the eighth position on the league table and have been eliminated from the Beker Van Belgie, Belgium’s cup competition. Genk are in danger of missing out on the Belgian league play-offs if they lose to Seraing on the final day of the season and the 27-year-old, whose hat-trick on Sunday took his goals tally to 19 this season, admitted it would be a big blow should they fail to qualify, and also hopes to score his 20th league goal of the season. “I think it is especially important that we do an excellent job for the Europe play-offs,” Onuachu was quoted as saying by Het Belang Van  Limburg. “It would be a blow to our supporters if we were to miss them. This victory should give us a big boost. And next week in Seraing I hope for my 20th, that looks much better than 19 goals.” Onucahu, who was the league’s highest goalscorer last season, is six behind top scorer Deniz Undav with just a match left.
