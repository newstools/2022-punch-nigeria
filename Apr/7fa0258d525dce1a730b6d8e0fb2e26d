The Akwa Ibom State High Court presided over by Justice Bassey Nkanang has dismissed a no-case submission filed by the defence counsel for Prof Ignatius Uduk, who was standing trial over alleged electoral fraud in the 2019 general elections. Justice Nkanang ruled on Thursday that the professor of Physical and Health Education at the University of Uyo, Uduk had a case to answer before the court relating to his conduct as the collation and returning officer for Essien Udim constituency elections. Nkanang dismissed the submission of the defence counsel and ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission; the plaintiff, to proceed with the legal engagements. Speaking with newsmen shortly after the ruling, lead counsel for INEC, Clement Onwuenwunor, said, “It would have been a failure of justice for the court to have held that the accused who had issued contradictory documents had no case to answer. He has to explain the contradictions. The first official report he submitted to INEC shows that there was no collation and no returns made.” Onwuenwunor advised that as the nation prepares for 2023 elections, it must pay attention to human elements which play a key role in the conduct of elections. In reaction to the ruling, the lead counsel for the defendant, Abasiodiong Ekpenyong, said he was not satisfied with the ruling, adding that he would take a closer look at it to understand the next steps to take. Justice Nkanang adjourned the case to June 23, 27, 28 and 30 for the commencement of defence. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
