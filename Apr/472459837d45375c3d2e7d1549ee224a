THE Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said his administration would put plans in place to improve the lives of citizens through the provision of adequate infrastructure. Sanwo-Olu said this on Tuesday during a meeting with management team of FMDQ Group Plc and Financial Sector Deepening Africa, who paid him a courtesy visit at Lagos House, Marina. He said, “We need to look for other sources of financing. We need to be very creative in our financing model. The population is huge and there is pressure on us to meet up with some of our very big and expanded economy. “We are truly pushing ourselves in various areas. I am personally excited when I know and see that our team and your team are driving toward a convergence that can better the lots of our citizens. “We will continue to push until we get the desired result. Infrastructure is one of the ways in which societal problems can be solved; it is something that we are looking holistically at, believing that we want to improve the lots of our citizens given the political chance that God has given us.” Copyright PUNCH.
