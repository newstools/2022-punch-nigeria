Acoroner, Mikhail Kadiri, presiding over the inquest into the circumstances surrounding the death of a Dowen College pupil, Sylvester Oromoni (Junior), on Monday, barred journalists and other interested persons from the court sitting. The news of Sylvester’s death went viral following a social media post by his cousin, Perry Oromoni, who alleged that some senior pupils of the college beat him up in his hostel because he refused to join a cult. But the school denied the claim, stating that the boy complained of leg pain following an injury he sustained while playing football. A coroner’s inquest was set up by the state government to look into the case. During the court sitting on Monday, the registrar announced that the hearing was mainly for lawyers and urged reporters and other parties to leave the courtroom. PUNCH Metro gathered that the decision was taken by the coroner because some of the college pupils, who were minors, were in court to testify. A lawyer from the Nigerian Bar Association, Ikeja branch, Benard Oniga, told our correspondent that journalists would not be allowed to cover the proceedings during the week. Oniga said, “Journalists are not going to be allowed to cover the inquest this week because minors from the school will be testifying in court. “The witnesses are minors and the purpose is to protect their rights according to the Child Rights Acts against public reporting.” The family had alleged that the 12-year-old student died on November 30, 2021, after he was forced to drink a blackish substance. However, the result of the autopsy revealed that Oromoni died from acute bacterial pneumonia due to severe sepsis. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
