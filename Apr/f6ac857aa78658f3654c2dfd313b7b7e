A not-for-profit organisation, Ajoke Relief Foundation, has provided food items to the elderly and empowered trained artisans. The empowerment, according to a statement on Sunday, was held at the Anglican School, Makoko, Lagos. The General Manager of the Foundation, Mr Oluseyi Ogunlana,  in the statement, said no fewer than 300 women in Makoko benefited from the food items shared while 30 trained youths benefitted from other relief materials for their businesses. He said, “We gave food items to show care to the elderly. We have also decided to give out some relief materials to people who have learnt one trade or the other. The Foundation was established in 2006 and we’ve been feeding the poor, training and empowering people since then. “The Founder, Mrs Ajoke Akintunde, started the relief foundation as a result of her kind gesture, particularly to people who need help. Unfortunately, we live in a very selfish world, where people just think about themselves and care less about the poor. We just want to do something different and make an impact in the lives of people. I believe with this kind of gesture, people will feel more loved, and cared for. We can’t always feed them every day but this gesture will go a long way. “We were inspired to do this in one of the most deprived communities and we figured that Makoko community is one of those. We chose this community because it is a multi-ethnic one.”
