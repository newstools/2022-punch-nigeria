THE Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said his administration is determined to create massive economic opportunities for citizens through the roles of cooperatives. Sanwo-Olu, who was represented by the Commissioner for Commerce, Industry and Cooperatives, Mrs Lola Akande, stated this on Thursday during the convocation of professional diploma programme of the Lagos State Cooperative College in Agege. He said, “We established this college out of the need to complement efforts towards the creation of an economy that is knowledge-driven and skill-based in appreciation of the key role of cooperatives in enterprise development, job creation and generation of massive economic opportunities for the teeming population of the state. “It is therefore expected that the existence of LASCOCO would help to enhance performance of book keepers and trustees of cooperative societies through the provision of need-based training while also helping to meet specific manpower needs of the state through the provision of high-level manpower with capacity for self-employment and job creation.” The Chairman of LASCOCO Governing Council, Mr Oyewale Raji, noted that cooperatives management will improve the economic growth for residents, including rural dwellers. “The economic reverberations and trickle-down effects of activities of this subsector can only be imagined in terms of improving the economic emancipation of the greater number of our rural dwellers and thus enable us to provide assets to collateralise loans from conventional banks and financial institutions,” he said.
