The Osun State Government has announced Monday, May 9, as the resumption date for the third term of the 2021/2022 academic session. This was contained in a Public Service Announcement signed by Adelani Aderinola, Permanent Secretary, Osun State Ministry of Education and obtained in Osogbo on Thursday. The PSA shared on the Facebook page of the ministry said the change in resumption date from May 2 to May 9 was informed by the May Day and Eid El Fitr holidays that would be observed in the first week of May. It read, “This is to inform the general public, particularly parents, guardians, head of public and private schools, as well as other stakeholders in basic and post basic schools in the state that resumption date for Third Term 2021/2022 session is now Monday 9th May, 2022. Not Monday 2nd May, as formerly announced. “Parents and guardians are enjoined to keep custody of their wards while the holidays last.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
