Cyriel Dessers will be looking to increase his goals tally when Feyenoord lock horns with French side Olympique Marseille in the Europa Conference League first leg semi-final clash on Thursday (today) at the Feyenoord Stadium in Holland, but admits he’s been a target of opposing defenders following his heroics in the competition. Dessers is the competition’s joint-top scorer with eight goals, along with England striker of Nigerian descent Tammy Abraham, but the Nigerian edges the AS Roma star on the log, having provided two assists, while Abraham has none. After failing to score in his first three appearances in the competition, Dessers turned things around scoring all of his eight goals in his last seven appearances in the league. The Nigerian has been one of the most influential players in the team, having scored 42.1 per cent of the club’s goals in the competition, which has put opposing defenders on the alert. Speaking ahead of the game, Dessers said he expected defenders to come after him. “De Kuip (Feyenoord Stadium) is special anyway, but the European evenings have some extras,” he told Feyenoord’s channel. “I expect it to be one of the best matches of my career. This is what you dream of if you want to become a footballer as a child. “You notice that opponents often adjust to taking the striker out of the game. I like that. Slavia (Prague) also had that plan, but somewhere it didn’t work out so well.” Dessers is currently Nigeria’s highest scorer in European competitions this season with eight goals followed by Slavia Prague’s Yira Sor, who found the back of the net six times for the Czech side before they were sent packing by Feyenoord in the quarter-finals.
