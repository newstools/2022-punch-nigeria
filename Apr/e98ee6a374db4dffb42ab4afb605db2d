Gombe State Governor, Muhammadu Yahaya, has ordered his appointees and other public servants seeking elective offices in the forthcoming parties’ primaries ahead of the 2023 elections to tender their resignation. According to a press statement signed on Friday by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Ibrahim Njodi, the officials are expected to comply with the directive within the specified 30 days time frame. Njodi cited the Electoral Act, 2022 recently assented to by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), which provides that political appointees aspiring to contest elections must resign their positions before the conduct of political parties’ primaries. The statement partly read, “In accordance with the provisions of the Act, the Independent National Electoral Commission has released the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general elections. Specifically, it is stated that all political appointees and other public servants aspiring to contest political offices are expected to resign their appointments 30 days before party primaries.” Copyright PUNCH.
