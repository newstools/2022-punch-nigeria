THE Ebonyi State Governor and presidential hopeful, David Umahi, has denied dropping his presidential bid for the Senate come 2023. The state Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Uchenna Orji, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday in Abakaliki. He described the viral claim which suggested that the governor had backed out of the race for the ticket of the All Progressives Congress as falsehood peddled by political charlatans. He said, “We restate for the pleasure of progressive Nigerians home and in the diaspora that the falsehood trending currently in social media that Governor Umahi has dropped his ambition for Senate is nothing but the empty and vaunting architecture of political charlatans who are intimidated by the tall and admirable hallmarks of leadership excellence recorded by Governor Umahi.” Orji also described the sponsors of the rumour as political jobbers who would be made to face the full wrath of the law as he stressed that Umahi’s presidential ambition was unwavering and alive in the hearts of Nigerians.
