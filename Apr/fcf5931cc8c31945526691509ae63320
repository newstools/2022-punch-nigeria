A former Vice Chancellor of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko, Prof. Oluwafemi Mimiko, has said Nigeria’s situation is not hopeless and can be salvaged. Mimiko, who spoke in an exclusive interview with Saturday PUNCH, said the country could put an end to its economic woes and lay a foundation for a new beginning that would make the world accord her respect. He explained that the country’s condition could be turned around from the current position where safety of lives and property, provision of electricity, potable water and good roads could not be guaranteed. The university don advised that Nigeria must do away with a system that promoted marginalisation of the youth and women population, disdain for education and innovation for it to get back on track. He said, “I do not think the situation of Nigeria is hopeless. If anything, I have a clear idea what we need to do to stanch this crisis and lay the basis for a new beginning. “I have often argued that if and when we summon the courage to get back on track, in 10 short years, Nigeria can make the bend and become a country with which its population will be happy and proud, and the world would accord respect, and not the one we run today that   neither provides electricity to its population nor guarantees safety of life and property. “But the general orientation must be to do away with a system that promotes exclusion, marginalises the youth and women population, disdains education and discourages innovation. “These are doable. I am a student of political and economic transition across countries, and I have seen how hitherto poor nations that you wouldn’t even give a chance did it – in East Asia, in Latin America, everywhere.”  Copyright PUNCH.
