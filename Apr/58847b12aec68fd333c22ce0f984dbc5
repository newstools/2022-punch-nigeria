A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress and member of the Governance Advisory Council, Alhaji Mutiu Are, says the GAC has not endorsed any senatorial aspirant in Lagos State. The GAC led by APC stalwart, Bola Tinubu, is the apex decision-making body of the party in Lagos State and it comprises serving and former governors, senators, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, among others. The council had last week endorsed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for a second term. However, there were rumours that the Deputy Speaker of the House of Assembly, Wasiu Eshilokun, had been endorsed as the senatorial candidate for the Lagos-Central senatorial district. However, Are told our correspondent that nobody had been endorsed by the GAC. “I can confirm to you that the GAC has not endorsed any aspirant,” Are stated. Tinubu’s wife, Remi, currently serves as the Senator representing Lagos-Central. However, she is not expected to return since her husband is running for President and has already purchased the form. Also, the lawmaker representing Lagos-West senatorial district, Solomon Adeola aka Yayi, has declared his intention to contest the Ogun-West senatorial election where he is originally from. This has left both Lagos-West and Lagos-Central senatorial districts’ seats ‘vacant ‘. Some notable politicians who are believed to be eyeing the senatorial seats include former Deputy Governor Oluranti Adebule, Amb Demola Seriki, Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, and the current Deputy Governor, Obafemi Hamzat. While all the aforementioned may run for Lagos-West, Seriki is expected to contest the Lagos-Central senatorial ticket. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
