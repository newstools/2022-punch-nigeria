Former Gombe State Governor, Ibrahim Dankwambo, said he would purchase presidential form if his supporters urged him to participate in the 2023 election. The two-term immediate past governor stated this on Saturday while briefing journalists shortly after he was received at the secretariat of the Peoples Democratic Party. Dankwambo who has been away from Gombe politics in the last three years disclosed that he bought the form in 2019, following his conviction to contest for the office of the President. According to him, the PDP nomination form is still being sold and he could buy, following the outcome of his consultation with his supporters, adding that he was willing to make sacrifices. He said, “I’m not sure whether anybody told me I should come out for anything. I came out before, my aspiration was to become President in 2019. “If they want me to purchase form I will go and get form. We will consult, including the people, if they think I can be President. They are still selling the form until Friday, but I’m prepared and ready to make sacrifice.” Dankwambo commended residents of the state for remaining peaceful despite the hardship. “Let me thank you for coming out to receive me, I didn’t invite anybody, I didn’t tell anybody I’m coming I just came to pay homage to people, extend condolences in some places, share goodwill and good spirit to the people of Gombe. “How Gombe is, I don’t know, how has the state been in the last three years, in the next few days, I will get to understand the impact of the last three years, whether we have made progress in terms of improvement in general wellbeing in security and other types of human indicators,” Dankwambo added.
