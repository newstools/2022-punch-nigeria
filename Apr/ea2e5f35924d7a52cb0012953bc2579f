Stanbic IBTC Insurance, a subsidiary of Stanbic IBTC Holdings, has launched a life insurance campaign with the theme ‘The good life’.

The event also featured an unveiling of the official music video, with actors, Kate Henshaw and Segun Arinze, and musician, Ric Hassani, singing in tune of ‘Insurance cover me’. Giving his opening remarks at the event, the Chief Executive, Stanbic IBTC Holdings, Dr Demola Sogunle, said “Many Nigerians are just beginning to understand the importance of insurance but as an organisation, we have been very deliberate about educating both young and old about the advantage that the right insurance cover provides to life and property. “Today, in taking that effort further, we launched what we have tagged ‘The good life campaign’ to advocate the value that comes from having life insurance and the availability of multiple life insurance solutions from our life insurance company – Stanbic IBTC Insurance.” Speaking on the rationale behind the insurance campaign, the Chief Executive, Stanbic IBTC Insurance, Akinjide Orimolade, said having a life insurance package was a necessity as it would guarantee peace of mind and aid preparedness for unprecedented occurrences.
