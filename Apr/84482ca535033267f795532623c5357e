Gunmen alleged to be terrorists on Tuesday night ambushed and killed the leader of a vigilante outfit, Buhari Funtua, in the Bakori Local Government Area of Katsina State. Residents revealed that Funtua was killed at about 11pm at the Dutsen Rimi Low Cost area of Bakori town while on his way to repel an attack by terrorists said to be operating in the area. According to the residents, Funtua was killed after he ran into an ambush laid by the terrorists. One of the residents, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, “Funtua was called on the telephone by a resident of the Low Cost that a group of bandits were attacking the area, and that he and his group should hurry up to rescue them. “Funtua usually surveys the area under attack by bandit before reinforcing his members to the area. “As he rode on his motorcycle to the affected community, he saw a group of people he wrongly assumed as residents of the area. “He asked why they were standing and doing nothing while their community was being attacked and they replied that the attack was taking place a little further away. “As he rode away from them, they shot him on the back several times, he collapsed in the process and died shortly afterwards.” The residents said Funtua was buried about 10am on Wednesday according to Islamic rites. The reaction of the spokesman for the state police command, Gambo Isah, was still being awaited as of the time of filing this report.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
