An operative of the South-East Security Network, also known as Ebubeagu, has been killed by gunmen in Ebonyi State. City Round learnt that the deceased, identified as Iboko Christian, was attacked on Thursday night by the gunmen who trailed him to his house in Nduogbuovu community, in the Izzi Local Government Area of the state. It was gathered that Christian, said to be a graduate, joined Ebubeagu due to his inability to secure a job. Ebubeagu was set up by South-East governors to complement the efforts of the police and other security agencies in checking the rising crime rates in the region. Confirming the incident, the lawmaker representing Izzi/East Constituency in the Ebonyi State House of Assembly, Anthony Nwegede, said the assailants robbed Christian of some money and his motorcycle before killing him. Nwegede, who condemned the killing, said the matter had been reported to the police for investigation. His death came barely a week after a commander of the security outfit was killed in Umuezeoka community, in the Ezza North Local Government Area of the state. Investigations revealed that in January, another member of the outfit, Sunday Nwafor, was shot dead by gunmen and then beheaded in Ekpelu community, in the Ikwo Local Government Area of the state. Also in January, another member of the security outfit, Ifeanyi Orogbo, was killed and his remains partially burnt by the assailants in Igweledeoha community.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
