The governorship candidate of the Action People’s Party in the July 16 Osun governorship poll, Adeolu Adebayo, has called on the electorate to vote for him at the poll and promised to correct mistakes of past administrations. This was contained in a statement titled: ‘Osun Guber: Vote out APC, APP guber candidate tells electorate,’ signed by Adebayo and obtained in Osogbo on Thursday. The statement said the APP candidate spoke in Oyan, a community in the Odo Otin Local Government Area of Osun State during a familiarisation tour and presentation of gifts to some elderly people in the area. He said the All Progressives Congress administration in the last 12 years in the state had failed to ameliorate the sufferings of the masses. He, however, assured that his “government will right all the wrongs of the previous administrations in the state if elected. I will focus more on the development of the agricultural sector which is capable of improving the economy of the state. “The state is blessed with valuable economic resources, including arable land, tourist centres and mineral resources, which if developed can transform the state’s economy within a short period of time.” Adebayo, who called on the people of the state to support his ambition, said his party, the APP, has welfarist programmes that other parties lack, adding that the interest of the masses is paramount to him and his party.
