The Anambra State Government has set up a 15-member Committee on Truth, Justice and Peace. The governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, had promised to set up the committee with a view to enable the state government to interface with agitators, so as to allow peace to return. The committee was set up following agitations which have led to killings and destructions of property in the state and the south-east region, citing the Monday sit-at-home restriction. According to a statement signed by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Solo Chukwulobelu, and made available to journalists in Awka, on Wednesday, the purpose of the committee is to seek a restorative justice approach for truth-telling or real facts, and for the healing of the victims of the violence. It stated that the committee will account for the responsibility and accountability of the actors, conditional mercy for the repentant perpetrators. It will also handle their restitution for certain losses and rehabilitation to allow restoration of peace and justice as well as the promotion of development in the state, and the region/Nigeria. It added that given the cross-border nature of the conflict, the focus goes beyond Anambra, and possibly covers the entire South-East. The members include: Prof Chidi Odinkalu, Chairman; Ambassador Bianca Ojukwu, Member/Secretary; and  Dr. Joe Nwaorgu, member. Other are Dr. Udenta Udenta, Dr. Uju Agomoh, Rev. Fr (Msgnr) Jerome Madueke; Canon Dr. Okechukwu C. Obi-Okoye; Mr. Charles Oputa (Charly Boy); Dr. John Otu; Mr. Ngozi Odumuko; Ms Onyeka Onwenu; Dr. Joe Abah; Mr. Chukwuma Okpalaezeukwu; Mr. Sam Egwuatu and Prof. Joseph Ikechebelu.  Copyright PUNCH.
