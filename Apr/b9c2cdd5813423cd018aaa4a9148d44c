The Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, on Sunday, in Abuja, said that the northern elders did not “impose” him or the former Senate President Bukola Saraki as the northern consensus presidential candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party. He argued that contrary to opinions making the rounds, the Professor Ango Abdullahi-led committee held wide consultations with key party stakeholders before arriving at its decision. Mohammed’s assertion was captured in a statement signed by the Spokesman of the Bala Mohammed Presidential Campaign Organisation, Prof. Udenta Udenta, titled ‘Senator Bala Mohammed presidential campaign organisation commends General Babangida and the elders, unfolds its campaign trajectory ‘Nigeria First’. Bala, who said he would not join issues with any individual or body on the question of the Consensus Arrangement, advised all parties aggrieved by the selection process to focus on their individual political trajectories without let or hindrance. According to him, we wish to place it on record that Gen. Babangida never approached nor lobbied anybody to superintend the process that will lead to the emergence of a consensus presidential aspirant. “Rather it was the group of presidential aspirants made up of Senator Bala Mohammed, Aminu Tambuwal, Senator Bukola Saraki and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen that collectively, freely, and willingly approached General Babangida to help select from amongst themselves a consensus presidential aspirant.” Copyright PUNCH.
