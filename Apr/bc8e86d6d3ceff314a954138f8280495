The  Oluwasegun Idowu Foundation has urged the Lagos State Government to establish coding facilities in every Local Government Area in the state. Speaking at the graduation of 120 students who were trained in coding, founder of the NGO, Mr Oluwasegun Idowu, who is also an aspirant for Lagos State House of Assembly, Ikoyi/Obalende Local Council Development Area, explained that the knowledge of technology had become essential to students. He explained that 457 students applied for the entrance examination but 120 students passed the exams. The children were trained at Prime Foster Schools, Obalende, Lagos. Idowu said the essence of the coding class was to give opportunity to children of the  less privileged who couldn’t afford the fees of schools where coding is taught. “I am a politician we know the future is technology, today, the children have learned how to develop apps, develop websites,  they have been taught the coding, language programming instruction. We discovered that the eight richest people in the world are from tech, so we felt why don’t  introduce the children to technology. They can become web developers and others if they have these skills. “We had a set of ages 6 to 10 and 11 to 16. “Government should have coding facility in every Local Government Area in Lagos.“ Director of school, Foster Prime Schools, Mr Patrick Foster said, “This is the first time we are hosting people outside the school. At Foster Prime Schools, we believe that learning should be fun when children can easily remember what they are thought against the conventional style of learning.” Copyright PUNCH.
