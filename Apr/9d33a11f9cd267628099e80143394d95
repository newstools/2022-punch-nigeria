A Peoples Democratic Party presidential aspirant and Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, on Saturday, said the drive for industrialisation in Lagos State would jump-start Nigeria’s economy. He called for a special status for Lagos and promised to pursue policies that would make the state’s economy blossom. Emmanuel said the development of the Lagos economy would have a multiplier effect on the nation. He said Lagos as the former federal capital deserved good attention like its counterparts across the globe. Emmanuel was in Lagos as part of his consultation and mobilisation tour of PDP state chapters. He visited a PDP leader, Chief Olabode George, and other chieftains to solicit their support for his ambition. The governor was accompanied by Senator Gabriel Suswan, a former governor of Benue State; Col Habib Shuaibu, his campaign manager; and Commissioner for Information, Ini Ememobong. George, who welcomed the governor and his team, spoke on the importance of Lagos as the commercial hub of the nation and a hospitable centre for all.
