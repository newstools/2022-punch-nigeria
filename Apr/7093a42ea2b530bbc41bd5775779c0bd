The National Theatre of Nigeria, in conjunction with Live Theatre Lagos, has announced the live presentation of a scintillating opera, ‘Dis Loyal Judas,’ introduced by the Crown Troupe of Africa. The opera would be staged by 5pm starting from Good Friday, April 15, to Easter Monday, April 18, at the National Arts Theatre, Iganmu, Lagos State. According to the organisers, the production is based on the account of the gospel as it relates to the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is a social exposition of the relationship between the Saviour of the world—according to the Christian Worldview— and the disciple who betrayed him, Judas Iscariot. The opera, which centered around the Easter period, would thoroughly examine the story of the crucifixion while exploring the concept of love, trust, betrayal, loyalty, sacrifice, as well as emphasizing the importance of making the right choices every day using Jesus and Judas as social archetypes. Composed and directed by the Founder, Crown Troupe of Africa, Segun Adefila, and produced by Oluwanishola Adenugba of the Live Theatre Lagos, Dis_Loyal Judas’ opera is stage managed by Adeleke Solanke, aka Lakeshow, with Professor Sunny Ododo as the Executive Producer.
