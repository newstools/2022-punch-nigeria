Cross Rivers State Governor, Prof. Ben Ayade, Tuesday in Abuja said he had secured the approval of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to hold consultations leading up to unveiling his plans to contest for the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress. He also declared to rally behind former President Goodluck Jonathan if he (Jonathan) emerges the APC’s Presidential flag bearer ahead of next year’s election. Ayade disclosed this to State House Correspondents shortly after his meeting with the President at Aso Rock Villa. Going forward, he said, he would kick off consultations over his presidential bid. Speaking of Jonathan, Ayade said he had profound respect for the former president and would not mind supporting him if the APC offered him the Presidential ticket. Ayade added that his conversations with the President is to seek counsel as he prepares for next month’s primary elections. He, however, clarified that he did not expressly tell the President of his desire to succeed him but only asked for nod to begin holding consultations. He said the President gave him the approval to begin consultations. Quizzed about his chances of winning against Jonathan if the former President joins the race, Ayade said: “I have great respect for President Jonathan. So, I have no challenges whatsoever. “I believe that the party leadership will decide the appropriate candidate that will take our party to victory and so if you heard me well, I am just part of the family, absolutely loyal to the President, seeking to run for president and I’m running. “At any point in time the political leadership of my party, the APC, feels that (former) President Jonathan is the appropriate candidate that will take us to victory, I will turn my support for him. “I am never ever going to fight the establishment, the institution, the aristocracy, the spiritual vortex of which God has placed a leader in the country. I will never question the powers of the leader of the country. “I have never played the politics of antagonism or fights. If you know how I became governor, I became governor by offering to support whoever the governor wants. By a stroke of luck, I became the candidate. The same token… I’m only here to support the President’s candidate and by a stroke of luck he said you to go there and join the race.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
