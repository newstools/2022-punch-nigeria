The Araba of Ibadanland and Olu Isese of Oyo State, Chief Ifalere Odegbola, has commended human rights lawyer, Mr Femi Falana, SAN, for his statement in support of a public holiday for traditional religion adherents, saying the position of the law also shows that traditionalists are demanding their rights. Odegbola said in a statement that a public holiday for traditional religion adherents was long overdue and that other states in all Yorubaland should emulate Osun, which had declared a public holiday for traditional religion faithful. “As traditional religion worshippers, we are optimistic that very soon, Oyo State will equally declare public holidays for traditional religion worshippers. Other states in Yorubaland will equally do the same,” he stated. Odegbola also commended the efforts of the Oyo State chapter of the Traditional Worshippers Association of Nigeria, under its Chairman, Adefabi Dasola, and Secretary, Dr Fakayode Fatunde, for its steadfastness and commitment to the propagation of Yoruba culture and tradition. “I also use this medium to commend the state governor, Seyi Makinde, who has now given room for further dialogue between traditional religion worshippers and his government. We want to thank the governor and also appeal to him to consider the issue of public holiday for traditional religion worshippers without further delay,” he added.
