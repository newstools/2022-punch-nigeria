Operatives of the Force Intelligence Bureau Response Team have arrested four notorious arms dealers and recovered 57 AK-47 rifles and a large catchment of ammunition in Jos, Plateau State, and from other locations across the country. The suspects, Hamza Zakari (Hamzo), 20; Abubakar Muhammed (Fancy), 22; Umar Ibrahim, 25; and Muhammed Abdulkarim (Dan-Asabe), 37, all males and residents of Jos, were arrested following credible intelligence on their nefarious activities in Jos and its environs. A statement by the Force spokesman, Muyiwa Adejobi, on Thursday,  said, “The suspects, who confessed to their involvement in arms dealings and other criminal acts, have been identified as one of the major links for the supply of arms and ammunition to criminal elements terrorising the state and some other parts of the country. “The investigation team is on the trail of their accomplices and they are closing in on them.” Similarly, acting on a tip-off, the FIB-IRT reportedly arrested three suspected gunrunners in Ibi LGA of Taraba State. The police said the suspects – Bello Sani, Venab Puncat, and Yusuf Nahoda – during interrogation, confessed to having purchased one AK-47 rifle and one SMG rifle for N900,000. Adejobi said efforts were on to arrest their collaborators and recover the exhibits. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
