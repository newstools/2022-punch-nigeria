A co-founder of the Bring Back Our Girls Movement, Aisha Oyebode-Muhammed, has urged parents of the abducted Chibok girls to vote wisely in the 2023 general elections. She disclosed this in a statement in Lagos on Thursday to commemorate the anniversary of the abduction of the Chibok girls. The PUNCH had reported that about 276 students of the Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, Borno State, were abducted by Boko Haram insurgents on April 14, 2014. In spite of government intervention to secure the release of some of the girls, eight years after the initial kidnapping, over 100 of the girls remain missing. Oyebode-Muhammed said, “Eight years today, about 100 of the abducted girls of the Government Girls Secondary School are yet to get freedom with no further clue from appropriate quarters on the development. “It is from this background that I want to urge all to use your votes wisely in the next elections. It is lamentable that despite all efforts, all the girls have not been returned. “The election period should be used to make the search and rescue of your daughters an election event. My heart breaks for you and I remain saddened that despite all our collective actions and that of the many other families affected by this brutal insurgency, your daughters remain absent at this period.”  Copyright PUNCH.
