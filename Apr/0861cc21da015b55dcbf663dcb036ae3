The National Vice Chairman of the All Progressives Congress and the leader of the South-East APC, Dr. Ijeomah Arodiogbu, has begun consultations with the Igbo stakeholders in the South-East. The visit to the key stakeholders in the region was with the aim to sell the party to these opinion moulders and ensure a smooth sail for the party come 2023. Arodiogbu, who had in his inaugural Zonal Executive Committee meeting, announced that the party was much interested in winning over Abia, Anambra and Enugu states in the forthcoming elections, paid a courtesy visit to Dr. George Obiozor, the President-General of the apex Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo in Owerri on Saturday. Arodiogbu said the visit was strategic to the South-East APC’s drive to sell the right narratives about the party and its immense benefits for the South-East, particularly how the region had benefitted from the massive infrastructural efforts of the Federal Government which was capable of boosting the economic development of the region and would attract investment and help create jobs. He also described Obiozor’s leadership of Ohanaeze as dynamic, noting that Ohanaeze had always championed the Igbo cause within a progressive Nigeria, adding that such a cause would always be accommodated in the APC.
