Two suspected kidnappers operating within Ochadamu in the Ofu Local Government Area of Kogi State on Wednesday met their Waterloo in the hands of local security hunters. An official of Ofu council area, Mohammed Musa, noted that a few days after attempting to kidnap innocent commuters plying the route after the Easter celebration, the criminals engaged in a gun battle with men of the Nigerian Navy, after which two members were arrested. He explained further that after discovering their hideouts in Ochadamu, the hunters ambushed the criminal elements around 2am on Wednesday. The suspects, who engaged the hunters in a gun duel for over 40 minutes, had two of their members gunned down while three escaped with varying degrees of injuries. The state Governor, Yahaya Bello, through his Chief Press Secretary, Onogwu Muhammed, commended the efforts of the security operatives in the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
