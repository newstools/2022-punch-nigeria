About 22 groups on the platform of the All Progressives Congress on Sunday endorsed the Kano State Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Alhaji Murtala Garo, for the 2023 governorship race in the state. In a statement signed by their Chairman, Auwal Dankano, on Sunday, the groups under the auspices of Rwinwin said the decision to endorse Garo was informed by a careful deliberation on who can deliver the dividends of democracy to the people. The group, in the statement, issued a two-week ultimatum to Garo to declare his intention or they will have no alternative than to institute legal action against him to respond to their call. According to the statement, the endorsement was due to his vast experience in governance, as well as the need to nominate an astute politician, who can continue the good work started by Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje.
