RIVERS State Governor and the Peoples Democratic Party’s presidential aspirant, Nyesom Wike, and his Taraba State counterpart, Darius Ishaku, on Thursday insisted on state police as one of the possible ways of checking insecurity in the country. According to the duo, establishing state police will be one enduring approach to addressing the festering insecurity in Nigeria. Wike, who was in Taraba to woo delegates of the PDP in the state ahead of the PDP presidential primaries, dismissed the arguments against the need for state police. He said, “The Federal Government cannot stop this insecurity without state police. You must have state police; there is no two ways about it. Having state police does not mean you will not have federal police. “All over the federal system, even councils have their police so that you employ people who know the environment. “You cannot take a stranger to go to Mambilla. It will take him years to understand that place. You can’t take a stranger and go to Donga or Chanchanji. So, you need people who know the environment to be able to take care of the place. “If federal offences are committed, the federal police should handle them. If they are state offences, the state police should handle them. One key thing to stop this insecurity in Nigeria is to have state police.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
