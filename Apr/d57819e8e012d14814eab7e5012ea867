As the 2023 general election beckons, different Nigerian youth groups across the country have called on a member of the House of Representatives representing Iseyin/Itesiwaju/Kajola/Iwajowa Federal Constituency, Honourable Shina Peller, to join the the presidential race. This was as the group flooded major roads across the country with posters bearing inscriptions of ‘Shina Peller for President’. Some of the groups asking the lawmaker to contest for the 2023 presidential race are Nigerian Youth League, Nigerian Youths in Politics, Coalition of Concerned Youth Organizations in the North Central geo-political zone, Nigeria Youth Alternative Council, Northern Youths Assembly of Nigeria and others. The groups lamented the decay in the country’s political and economic system, which it said, had continuously subjected Nigerian youths to hardship, “The era of voting for old and sick politicians is over, especially with the current economic reality,” said Moses Adeyefa, the Convener of Coalition of Concerned Youth Organizations. Explaining the rationale behind the choice of Peller as their preferred candidate, Ukkasha Rahama, the Convener of Northern Youths Assembly of Nigeria and National Chairman APC Youth Progressive Forum, noted that the lawmaker represented the change that the youth seek, arguing that he is the most vibrant young politician who is always speaking on the side of the youth. Also, the National President of the Nigerian Youth League, Mustapha Hadi, argued that only the youth could bring the desired change that the country had been yearning for, noting that the Peller had the qualities to lead the country.
