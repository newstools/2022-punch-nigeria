A group, the Christian Conscience, has called on Nigerians not to give up hope despite the various challenges facing the country. It also called on political leaders to make God the cornerstone in their lives and submit to his will in their activities. The group made the call in a statement in Lagos jointly signed by the National Chairman, Dr Yetunde Akinluyi; and the National General Secretary, Rev. Kolawole Verrals; and made available to journalists by its Publicity Director, Tunji Oguntuase, on Monday. The statement read, “Rising from a meeting after deep deliberations on matters concerning the nation, we want to call on Nigerians, especially the ruling class, to let the will of God prevail in their daily activities as there is still hope for a better Nigeria of our dream. “There is still hope in the horizon provided our political leaders make God the corner stone in their activities and are also submissive to the His will. Simply put, doing all things with the fear of God and being considerate to fellow human beings in all things. “We must have hope where there seems to be none because the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ has given us hope against all odds. Therefore, we admonish all Nigerians not to give up hope despite the various challenges facing the nation but trust in the almighty God who is sufficient and efficient in all matters of humanity. “Our political leaders need prayers more than before, the power of the devil cannot be compared with the power of God as He is capable of defeating darkness at all times if we, as a nation genuinely seek His face without pretence.” Copyright PUNCH.
