Fashion entrepreneur and a housemate on the ongoing TV reality show, ‘Real Housewives of Lagos’, Toyin Lawani, has said her husband, Segun Adebayo, and other family members support her decision to participate in the reality show. Speaking during a Zoom meeting with some journalists and housemates of the show, Lawani said, “When I was initially called to participate in the show, I was delighted but I was thinking if I really wanted to do it. The reason was because I just had my baby in London (United Kingdom). I had many things running in my head. However, I was encouraged that people want to see more of Tiannah when it comes to fashion. “One can never be too big to do something new and different. I have a lot of businesses and I do them together, including being a mother. I actually had my baby some days before I was called for the show. It was not really easy but I got the support of my husband and other members of my family. I have a strong support system in them.” Lawani, who is the Chief Executive Officer of Tiannah Empire, added, “I know (being on the show) will open more doors for me and my business. My family supports my business. At one point, my daughter, who is schooling in London, had to fly down to (Nigeria) to support me because I had to nurse my baby and still be on the show.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
