THE Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Lekan Balogun, has urged Yoruba groups agitating for a better Yoruba nation not to be weary until their goal is achieved. The monarch, according to a statement from the Olubadan Palace, hosted one of the groups called Atayese, led by Tokunbo Ajasin, at his residence on Wednesday. Oba Balogun, who acknowledged the various challenges confronting the people, generally ranging from economic meltdown, violence, youth unemployment, among others, noted that the situation could weigh down the activists. The statement read in part, “Yoruba groups agitating for a better and self determined nation should not to be weary or tired of the struggle until the end result of their struggle is achieved. “Tough times never last, only tough people do. There’s nothing too much to be done to ensure that one’s goal is achieved, and I promise you of my support for the attainment of your cherished goal.” One of the agitators, Gbenga Awosode, who spoke on behalf of the group, said aside their coming to felicitate Oba Balogun on his ascension to the Olubadan throne, the group also came to plead with him to use his rich experience to forge unity among his colleague Obas in Yoruba land. The lawyer-turned activist noted that Oba Balogun stood out as one of the most learned kings in Yoruba land with academic, political and business exposure. “Kabiyesi, we want unity of purpose among Yoruba Obas, and we want you to do your bit in that regard. This is time for our revered fathers to speak with one voice on issues that touch our common interest, and with your esteemed pedigree, this is achievable,” he said.
