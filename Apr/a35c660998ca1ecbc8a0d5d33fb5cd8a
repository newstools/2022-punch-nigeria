Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq on Saturday launched the Majlis (Council) for Sadaqah, Zakat and Waqf, a nongovernmental initiative conceived to fight extreme poverty and hunger among Muslims in the state. According to a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Rafiu Ajakaye, the governor described the launch as a great legacy for the House of Sheikh Alimi and commended the Emir of Ilorin, Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, for the initiative. AbdulRazaq said the initiative aligned with his administration’s policy to support the poor, underserved and vulnerable people through the Kwara State Social Investment Programme. He stated, “History is being made today in Kwara State as we gather for this unique project. This is a project that should concern every Muslim in our state.” “Many centuries ago, Allah prescribed a surefooted solution to the problem of mass poverty and social integration in our society. Many Muslim societies have taken full advantage of the institution of Zakat and Sadaqah to reduce extreme hunger and build a cohesive society where no one is left behind.’’ The emir of Ilorin and Chairman of the Kwara state Traditional Council, Dr Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, expressed optimism that the launch would make the initiative stronger.
