A yet-to-be identified policeman and three others have been killed while many others were abducted in a terrorist attack on Gwada community in the Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State. The attack was said to have occurred when Muslim faithful were breaking their Ramadan fast on Saturday evening. The spokesperson for the Coalition of Shiroro Association, Salisu Mohammed Sabo, said the attack lasted for over 4 hours unhindered. He added that the attack led to the abduction of many persons, one being a businesswoman whose shop was looted by the terrorists, and another the son of one of the officials of the North-South Power Company. “With this attack, it means that only Kuta has not been attacked in Shiroro. Gwada is very tensed and people are considering moving to Kuta as an alternative,” Sabo said. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Wasiu Abiodun, confirmed the incident, adding that the details of the incident were still sketchy. “On 16/04/2022, at about 1900hrs, information was received that armed bandits attacked Kadna village via Gwada, in the Shiroro Local Government area. “Police tactical team and other security agencies with vigilante were mobilised to the area and the hoodlums were repelled”, he stated. Abiodun further stated that he was unaware of the ransom of N2m being demanded from the relatives of the abducted persons. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
