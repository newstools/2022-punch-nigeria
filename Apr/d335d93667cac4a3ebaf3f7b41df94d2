Two traditional healers, who allegedly swindled a woman out of 29,000 pounds were on Thursday arraigned before a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. The News Agency of Nigeria reported that the police charged Mohammed Samatu, 40, and Ajani Kazeem, 47, with three counts of conspiracy, obtaining by false pretences and theft. They, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The police prosecutor, SP Idowu Osungbure, told the court that the defendants committed the offences in March, in the Yaba area of Lagos. She said the complainant, one Juliet, consulted the defendants on some personal issues she was experiencing. The prosecutor said the defendants told the complainant that she had some spiritual problems and needed to be “cleansed”. Osungbure further told the court that the defendants collected 29,000 pounds (about N26m) from the complainant for the cleansing exercise. The offence, she said, contravened sections 314, 287 and 411 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2015 (Revised). The Chief Magistrate, Adeola Adedayo, admitted the defendants to bail in the sum of N5m each with two responsible sureties in like sum. She further directed that each of the sureties must be a blood relation with all of them residing within the court’s jurisdiction. Adedayo adjourned the case till May 17 for mention.
