Erosion has caused massive destruction in Okai village, Eziama community in the Isiala Mbano Local Government Area of Imo State. Eziama is the hometown of a former Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Collins Chiji. The erosion was caused by heavy rainfall witnessed in the state on Monday. One of the victims of the flood, Emmanuel Nwike, said his house, shop and other property were affected. He added that a motorcycle was carried away by the erosion. Nwike stated, “Our house, my shop and the whole of the Okai village in Eziama has been overrun by erosion. There is no government help forthcoming but tomorrow, we will be asked to vote for them in an election. People are stranded as I speak to you. The destruction was massive.” Our correspondent saw a video footage where the flood was seen sweeping away people’s property. In that video, people were seen shouting for help and running into the flood to recover some of their property. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
