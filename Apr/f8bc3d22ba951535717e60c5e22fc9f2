THE Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (retd.), has described the crash of the Nigerian Air Force Super Mushshak training aircraft that claimed the lives of two pilots in Kaduna as a devastating loss to the nation. This is as he called on members of the Armed Forces not to allow the incident to dampen their morale. A statement on Thursday by the Special Assistant to Magashi on Media and Publicity, Mohammad Abdulkadri, said the incident had depleted the human capital assets of the Air Force. The statement read in part, “The defence minister, with deep sense of loss, said the sad occurrence had unfortunately depleted the human capital assets of the Nigerian Air Force in this challenging times when the Force is professionally and tactically deploying its rich air powers in joint operations with land forces to end all threats to national sovereignty and territorial integrity. “The death of Flight Lieutenants Abubakar Alkali and Elijah Karatu in line of duty is sad but heroic.” He assured Nigerians that their sacrifices would not be in vain. The minister also expressed confidence in the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Amao, and called on Nigerian Air Force not to allow the crash dampen the current high morale of the officers, airmen and airwomen of service by intensifying the explosive tempo of anti- banditry and counter-terrorism in the country. He, however, appreciated Amao for his proactive response in constituting an Accident Investigating Board. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
