Two yet-to-be-identified persons have been burnt to death for allegedly stealing a motorcycle from an operator in Kwakwashe, in the Suleja area of Niger State. The suspects were said to have killed the rider while trying to forcefully take the motorcycle away from him. Angered by the death of the operator, some residents reportedly ran after the men, caught up with them and set them on fire. The incident, which happened on Sunday, caused gridlock along the Madalla, Suleja entry route. A resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, “Around 4pm on Sunday, two thieves stole a motorcycle from an operator. “In the process, they killed the owner of the motorcycle and managed to run with the motorcycle. But residents ran after them and caught them. They beat them and set them on fire. The mob’s action must have been triggered by the fact that the motorcycle operator was killed.” The Niger State police spokesperson, Abiodun Wasiu, confirmed the incident to our correspondent. He urged residents to desist from jungle justice Wasiu said, “Around 3.45pm, information was received that two persons, who have yet to be identified but suspected to be motorcycle snatchers, were burnt to death by mob action at the Kwakwashe area of Madalla, Suleja LGA “Police patrol teams were mobilised to the area, and the incident is under investigation. Members of the public are advised to desist from self-help and report any incident to the police for immediate intervention.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
