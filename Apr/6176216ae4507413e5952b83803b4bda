A group in the All Progressives Congress in Ogun State, on Monday, raised a cheque of N50 million to purchase the 2023 governorship nomination and expression of interest forms for the state Governor, Dapo Abiodun. The organisation, under the aegis of Dapo Abiodun Mandate, said it was throwing its weight behind the second term bid of Abiodun as the state governor. The Chairman of the group, Biyi Adeleye, disclosed this at a press briefing held on the premises of the Governor’s country home in Iperu-Remo. Adeleye who is the Special Adviser on Political Affairs to the Governor, maintained that the group decided to support the second term bid because the governor completed all the abandoned projects of the past administration. He described the Abiodun as a silent achiever, adding that his administration has fulfilled all its promises. Adeleye said “Governor Dapo Abiodun has touched all the senatorial districts, every local government in Ogun State. He also took upon himself to complete all the abandoned projects of the past government because government is continuous. “Hence, the Dapo Abiodun Mandate as a group is compelled to purchase the nomination and intention form for our principal in endorsement of his second term in office, having made us proud as a silent achiever who works his talks by not promising to do everything but doing everything.” Copyright PUNCH.
