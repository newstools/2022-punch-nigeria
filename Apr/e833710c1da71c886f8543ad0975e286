A suspected ritualist, identified simply as Toogun, has reportedly been arrested by the police for allegedly killing a housewife, Modinat Basiru. Confirming the arrest, the Field Commandant, Osun Amotekun Corps, Amitolu Shittu, said a child of the deceased had reported at the Corps office in Ileogbo, Ayedire Local Government Area, that Basiru entered into the house of the suspect and did not come out afterwards. Shittu said his men immediately swung into action and visited Oke Osun, where the suspect was residing, but he was not found in the house. “Two of his relations were arrested. But we could not keep them because they have not committed any offence. When we released them, they were told to assist us in catching the fleeing suspect. “It was through our collaboration that the suspect was eventually apprehended in Lalupon, Oyo State. “The corpse was later found and exhumed. He dismembered the body and took some parts. He is currently in police custody,” Shittu said. The spokesperson for the Osun State Police Command, Yemisi Opalola, could not be reached for comment, as calls to her line did not go through. She had yet to also respond to a text sent to her as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
