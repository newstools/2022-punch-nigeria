Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, will not relax in his pursuit of better living standards for the residents, if re-elected for another term in the July 16, governorship poll. This was disclosed by his Special Adviser on Civic Engagement, Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, at a meeting his office held with members of the Palm Kernel Association, on Sunday, in Osogbo. Addressing the meeting, Oyintiloye, who represented Oyetola, said various developmental initiatives that had been completed would be improved upon, when the governor gets another term. Speaking against the backdrop of the belief that second-term governors usually slow down governance, Oyintiloye insisted that Oyetola had a covenant with God to serve the people and assured that the governor would also keep to his oath of office. “Nothing can change his covenant with God and the people of the state. This is because he sees politics as a means to serve the people and make a positive impact on their lives. “The yearning for re-election is to consolidate on what he has achieved since the inception of this administration. “And we can assure the good people of the state that more dividends of democracy will be made available during his second term. He won’t relax, but will work more to better the living standard of the people,” Oyintiloye said. A statement by Oyintiloye obtained in Osogbo on Sunday noted that the chairman of the association, Chief Abdulganiyu Ogundele, commended the governor’s accomplishments in his first term. He, however, appealed to him to assist the members of the association with soft loans to boost their business.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
