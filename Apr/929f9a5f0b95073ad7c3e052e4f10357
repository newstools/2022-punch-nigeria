The Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, has said that he is not scared of a former governor of Lagos State and national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, and other APC presidential contenders in the forthcoming 2023 polls. Bello made this disclosure in Abuja  during his second annual seminar for political and crime correspondents, barely 24 hours after expressing optimism that he was most favoured to clinch the party’s ticket for the Presidency. He reckoned that although Tinubu and other eminent personalities were founding members of the APC, the foundation of a house was not enough, as there were other things to be put in place to build a house. Asked if he was scared of contending with top presidential aspirants in the APC, Bello boldly declared, “I will say No! I am not scared of anybody in the contest for the APC presidential ticket”. “Tinubu and others are founding members of the APC, but foundation is not enough. I will defeat all the other aspirants because I have all it takes to be a champion. “My performance in Kogi State will speak for me,” Bello affirmed. According to him, there are over 16 million Nigerians with Permanent Voters Cards already waiting to vote him in the 2023 election. Asked why he was always rooting for the younger generation, Bello said he believed that Nigeria could do more with younger persons in power. ***Details Later
