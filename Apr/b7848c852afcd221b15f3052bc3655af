The number of Coronavirus infections in Africa has been dwindling in the last four months, the World Health Organisation announced on Thursday. According to the report, the number of COVID-19 cases registered each week had steadily declined over the past 16 weeks, while the number of deaths drastically reduced in the last eight weeks. It also noted that the overall rate of infections on the continent had tapered off from a peak of more than 308,000 cases per week at the beginning of the year to fewer than 20,000 new cases per week at present. This is the lowest level of infection since April 2020, when the pandemic began, it said. However, Africa, with its 1.3 billion people, has a very high number of unreported infections. The WHO assumes that the majority of all infections go unreported. Officially, the continent has registered almost 11.5 million coronavirus infections, of which more than 250,000 were fatal. NAN
