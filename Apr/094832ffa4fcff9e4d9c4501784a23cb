THE Nigeria Export Promotion Council has said the nation’s trade facilitation procedures are outdated. It added that the nation had not been a party to any single window recommendations since 2003. The Regional Coordinator, South West, NEPC, Lagos, Mr Samuel Oyeyipo, said this during a sensitisation workshop to encourage private sector participation with national trade facilitation bodies. Oyeyipo, who was represented at the event by the Director in the Office of the Chief Executive Officer, NEPC, Ms Estelle Igwe, said since the introduction of the single window in 2003, Nigeria had yet to have a national single window. He stated, “The Nigeria trade facilitation procedures went moribund and because we are not a party to any single window recommendations that are being developed, this is why we do not have a national single window.” He added that the absence of a national single window was affecting the nation’s ability to maximise its export potential.
