Gunmen have invaded a ‘beer parlour’ in Obiofia village in Osumenyi, in the Nnewi-South Local Government Area of Anambra State, and killed five persons. According to an eyewitness, the incident happened at the Ụtọ Ndụ Beer drinking joint late Friday. It was gathered that the unidentified gunmen invaded the restaurant at about 8:00pm on Friday and immediately opened fire on the customers who were drinking and having fun. About five of them, including the owner of the restaurant, identified as Ụtọ Ndụ, were said to have been killed. Videos from the scene of the incident, which are currently trending on social media, also showed that four of the victims were males, while one (the owner of the shop), a female, each lying lifeless in the pool of their own blood. Sympathisers, friends and relatives of the victims were also seen mourning and lamenting as the corpses were being loaded in a Sienna ambulance bus, for evacuation to a mortuary. A weeping feminine voice was also heard in the background lamenting (in Igbo language): “What have we done oooo? Who have we offended? What did we do to deserve all these?” The Police Public Relations Officer in Anambra State, DSP Tochukwu Ikenga, is yet to confirm the last night attack as of the time of filing this report, as he said enquires are still ongoing and promised to revert.
