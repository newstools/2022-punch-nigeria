Barely 24 hours after his arrest was ordered by Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, a Peoples Democratic Party’s governorship aspirant in the state, Farah Dagogo, was on Thursday evening arrested by a team of policemen. Dagogo, who is a serving member of the House of Representatives representing Degema-Bonny Federal Constituency, was arrested at the PDP zonal secretariat in Port Harcourt. Wike had, in a statement by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, alleged that Dagogo led suspected cultists to disrupt the screening of National Assembly and state House of Assembly aspirants on Wednesday. But Dagogo had since denied the allegation. The federal lawmaker had arrived at the secretariat a few minutes past 6 pm on Thursday and walked into the hall where the panel was conducting the screening, but some policemen followed him soon afterward. A few minutes after, Dagogo was seen coming out of the hall, surrounded by heavily armed security operatives who took him outside the office premises and took him into a patrol van with the inscription ‘Operation C4i-027.’ The patrol van immediately made a quick turn, a handful of operatives jumped at the back and zoomed off.
