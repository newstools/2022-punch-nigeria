A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has warned parties in the suit between Shehu Wada Sagagi and 30 others vs Peoples Democratic Party to act in accordance with the interim injunction made by the court on March 28, 2022, pending the hearing and determination of the interlocutory application for an injunction.  The case with suit no: FHC/ABJ/CS/393/2022 came up for hearing on the interlocutory application for injunction on Friday.  Announcing appearance for the plaintiffs, Dr J. Musa, SAN, informed the court that there was a supervening factor meant to undermine the authority of the court, as the first defendant purportedly dissolved the Peoples Democratic Party’s Executive Committees at the state, local government areas and wards levels in Kano State on March 30, 2022, after the service of the originating processes.  He noted that the motion on notice for injunction and the interim order of injunction made on March 28, 2022, on the defendants leading to the filing of an interlocutory application for a mandatory order of the court had been served on the defendants and was ripe for hearing.  Counsel to the first defendant, Adedamola Fanokum, denied that his client had dissolved the PDP Excos in Kano State.  He thus undertook that the first defendant would fully comply with the interim order of injunction of the court and will not do anything contrary, pending the hearing and determination of the interlocutory application which was adjourned till April 26, 2022, at the instance of the first defendant.
