Akogun of Edemonsi, Chief Awowale Olaniyi, in Ila Local Government Area of Osun State, suspended by Edigbon of Edemonsi, Oba Samuel Olaniyan, has accused the monarch of unjustly removing him. Olaniyi also accused the monarch of stopping his N3,000 monthly salary since he was unjustly suspended five months ago. Speaking with newsmen in Osogbo, Olaniyi then called on Osun state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, to immediately intervene and stop the monarch from further punishing him without justification. He said, “I started having problems with Oba Olaniyan since I refused to go and seize people’s land for him. A panel he put in place investigated me. “I was wrongly accused and investigated by a committee and the committee recommended suspension but Edigbon dismissed me. And since October 2021, my salary of N3,000 was stopped. Since the 14th of October, 2021, I have not been given a salary.” Also speaking, the Obanla of Edemonsi, Chief David Awojide, who is the deputy to Oba Olaniyan, also accused the monarch of suspending him because he refused to release land belonging to another family. But when contacted, Oba Olaniyan told The PUNCH that the affected chiefs should approach the court of law if they have genuine claims. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
