An artist, Adeyemo Olajide, aka Trazyx, has said musicians need to be humble and embrace love while working as a team player in a bid to achieve success in the Nigerian music industry. Noting that working in segregation would create division capable of negatively affecting the progress of the artiste, Trazyx said teamwork should be embraced instead of segregation. The Ekiti State indigene said, “Music is all about love, and if you have a team and they are not driven by a desire to propel you into achieving greatness, and instead of embracing love, there is segregation, it will affect the artist. “Segregation is more like a division; instead, we should embrace teamwork because as an artist, one needs love, humility and dedication to grow musically.” Speaking on the impact of the internet regarding the conduction of music business in Nigeria, he said it offered exposure and a bigger market for music promotion and profitability from music projects. “You can upload new projects from the comfort of your home and reach a wider demographic and audience. The music business is a numbers game, the more people listening to you and the more streams your project is getting equal more money; the internet offers a bigger market and exposure,” he added. Trazyx, who had collaborated with music sensation, Teniola Apata, aka Teni The Entertainer, in a song titled, Man No Be God, said he would soon drop an EP titled ‘No Bad Vibes.’ Copyright PUNCH.
