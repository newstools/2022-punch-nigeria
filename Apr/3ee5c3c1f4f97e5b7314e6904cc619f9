Cyriel Dessers and Yira Sor will be looking to grab their seventh goals of the ongoing UEFA Europa Conference League when Slavia Prague welcome Feyenoord to the Sinobo Stadium in Prague in the second leg of their quarter-final matchup on Thursday (today). Both sides settled for a 3-3 draw in Holland last Thursday, with Sor getting his name on the score sheet (his sixth goal of the campaign), while Dessers came on as a substitute but fired blanks. A win for either side will see them sail through to the semi-finals of the competition. Both players have been impressive in the competition scoring six goals apiece to sit second on the scorers log with AS Roma English striker Tammy Abraham, who has Nigerian parents, in top position with seven goals. Dessers has found the back of the net six times in nine appearances in the competition while Sor has scored six times in five appearances, with three assists. He has been on target in his last four appearances in the competition and looks the most likely to be on the score sheet again when both sides clash. Sor has been a revelation for Slavia Prague this season, scoring 10 goals and providing nine assists in 35 games across all competitions. The former Lobi Stars man joined the Czech giants at the beginning of the season from Banik Ostrava. Dessers on the other hand has found the back of the net 14 times in 39 appearances.
