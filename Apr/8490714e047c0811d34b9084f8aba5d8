The wife of a Lagos businessman, Vivian Obieshi, narrates how her husband, Chikere, was shot and killed by a MOPOL in Lagos State. Obieshi said, her husband went to honour his friend, Asiwaju’s birthday invitation, to celebrate with him at a bar. She added that although her husband didn’t like the environment, he went. Obieshi’s widow alleged that her husband’s death may have been planned, saying that after the incident, she did not hear from her late husband’s friend, Asiwaju. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
