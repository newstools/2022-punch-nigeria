Reality TV star Kim Kardashian is taking the high road amid her ongoing divorce from her former husband, Kanye West. Speaking in an interview with Good Morning America, Kim stated that despite her split from West, they are always going to remain family. Kim also admitted that maintaining a cordial relationship with West amid his social media attacks had not been easy, but she remained a “champion of him speaking his truth.” When asked how the couple’s four children were handling the split, the business mogul revealed that she had been open and honest with them about it. She also stated that while her younger children (Chicago, 4, and Psalm 2) “don’t understand as much”, the two older ones (North, 8 and Saint, 6) are aware of the current situation. “You have to just be there for them,” she said. “No matter what, even in this crazy life that we live, you just have to have a really open dialogue with your children. “Kanye and I have had conversations. We have to talk daily for the kids so you know, I hate that it had to play out like that. But when it comes to family, I mean, Kanye and I will always be family. “At the end of the day, I just want my kids to be happy and healthy, and think the world of their dad. And they do.” Kanye’s constant social media attacks against Kim and her new partner, Pete Davidson, turned the couple’s divorce into a tumultuous affair after it became public in 2021.
