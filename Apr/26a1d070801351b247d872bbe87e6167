A global anti-corruption organisation, Accountability Lab Nigeria, has expressed concerns over the level of corruption in the procurement and contracting processes in the country. The group said this had resulted in the loss of billions of dollars by the country, stressing that bribe-paying Nigerians spend an average of N28,200 annually on cash bribes. The group’s Country Director, Odeh Friday, stated this during an integrity conference organised by Accountability Lab in Abuja, according to a statement he personally signed on Saturday. The statement read in part, “Unethical practices and the cost of corruption in procurement/contracting processes and service delivery has led to the loss of billions of dollars. “Also, bribe-paying Nigerians spend an average of N28,200 annually on cash bribes. “A worrying lack of integrity and accountability within society has led to many people being left behind in governance and decision-making processes.
