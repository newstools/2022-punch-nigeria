Award-winning Nigerian singer, David Adeleke, popularly known as Davido, has announced his North American tour, set to kick off by June. Posting a picture of the tour schedule, the Afrobeats star made this known via his Twitter page on Tuesday. “I miss my fans in North America so much I had to put together a short run just to come see you all,” he tweeted. Hinting on a new album, Davido also stated he might preview some of its tracks during the shows. “Going to be plenty of surprises, and I might preview a few songs off my new album. Tickets on sale everywhere this Friday,” he tweeted. Tagged “We Rise By Lifting Others”, the tour will see Davido performing in Brooklyn, Toronto, Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles from the 16th to the 25th of June 2022. Last month, the father-of- three sold out the popular O2 arena in London for his March concert. He had earlier sold out the 20,000-capacity events center in 2019. Copyright PUNCH.
