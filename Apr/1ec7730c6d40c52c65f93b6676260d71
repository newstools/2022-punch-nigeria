The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Tuesday in Abuja, urged Nigerians to resist agents bent on causing breakdown of law and order in the country, assuring them that no individual or group will be allowed to destabilise Nigeria. Buhari said this at an Iftar dinner with state governors, ministers and heads of government agencies. The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, disclosed this in a statement titled ‘Nobody will be allowed to destabilise Nigeria -President Buhari vows’ made available to journalists. ‘‘We have the land, we have the resources, and we have the people. But I do not know why people will allow themselves to be successfully subverted to destabilise their own country,” the President was quoted to have told his guests. Buhari who thanked the governors and ministers for honouring his invitation to break the Ramadan fast with him, expressed the confidence that in spite of the current security challenges, the country will succeed. On the forthcoming general elections, he affirmed that being a beneficiary of free, fair and credible elections, the introduction of technology and the Permanent Voters Card will make it impossible for anyone to claim millions of votes again in the country.
