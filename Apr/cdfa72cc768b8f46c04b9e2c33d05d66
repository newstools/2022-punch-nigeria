The Chairman of the Delta State All Progressives Congress, Mr Omeni Sobotie, has assured the Minister of Transportation and presidential aspirant, Rotimi Amaechi, of the state’s support for him in the forthcoming presidential primary of the All progressives Congress. The party made its stance known when Amaechi took his consultations for the 2023 presidential primaries to Delta State, where he met with the leadership of the APC and delegates in Asaba as well as the Asagba of Asaba, Obi Chike Edozien on Friday. Amaechi urged the delegates to vote for him for his competence and not just because he “is from the South-South”. Amaechi said, “Let anybody who says I should not be President ask themselves, ‘What is his capacity?’ As Minister for Transportation, I was on this track (Warri-Itakpe rail line). When we came, there were bushes and trees on the track. “Knowing that South-South is part of Nigeria, I got the President to approve the money. It wasn’t a loan; it was funded from the budget. Today, you can travel from Itakpe to Warri, Warri to Itakpe, and then to Abuja. “As Minister, I don’t think the Nigerian people will say I’m an absentee Minister. I’m a Minister that is present almost all the time because I know what it is to deliver to the people.” Reacting, Sobotie was quoted in a statement on Friday, titled, ‘2023: Delta State APC Pledges Support for Amaechi’, which was signed by Amaechi’s Media Office and sent to Saturday PUNCH,  to have said that the 161 statutory and ad hoc delegates would cast their votes in Amaechi’s favour in the primaries, declaring total support for his candidacy.
