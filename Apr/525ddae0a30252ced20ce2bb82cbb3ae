A presidential aspirant, Kingsley Moghalu, has faulted the continued stay in office by members of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), who are seeking elective offices in the forthcoming general election. Current cabinet members seeking to contest the 2023 presidential election and who are yet to resign are the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; his Labour and Productivity counterpart, Chris Ngige, and Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba. The former Central Bank of Nigeria’s Deputy Governor said the ministers’ refusal to resign ahead of the primary elections in accordance with the Electoral Act indicated their lack of transparency. According to him, It is an indication of selfishness, lack of honor and transparency, and the capture of public office for private gain. In a tweet on his Twitter page on Thursday, the presidential aspirant described the ministers’ refusal to resign as “deeply wrong”. He wrote, “The refusal of Ministers in President @MBuhari‘s cabinet who seek elective office to resign their portfolios is deeply wrong. It is an indication of selfishness, lack of honor and transparency, and the capture of public office for private gain.” Meanwhile, The PUNCH reports that at least, 13 commissioners have resigned their appointments in Sokoto State ahead of the primary elections in accordance with the Electoral Act, bringing the total number of commissioners that had resigned in order to contest elections to over 60 across the 36 states.
