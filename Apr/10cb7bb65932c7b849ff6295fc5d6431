The Abuja Division of the Federal High Court, on Monday, deferred hearing on a suit seeking to stop the Federal Government from extraditing the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, to the United States of America, for trial till June 14. Cited as defendants in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/854/2021, are the Nigeria Police Force, and the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN. Justice Donatus Okorowo adjourned the matter following the absence of all the parties in court on Monday. When the suit was called up for hearing, neither the applicant nor the respondents were in court. There was also no legal representation for any of the parties. Consequently, Justice Okorowo, who had earlier threatened to strike out the case for want of diligent prosecution, said he was minded to grant one more adjournment. He ordered the service of hearing notice on all the parties. Kyari, who is currently facing trial for his alleged involvement in drug trafficking, was earlier indicted by the Federal Bureau of Investigationin the multi-million naira advanced fee fraud said to have been perpetrated by Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi. Police had earlier constituted a panel to probe Kyari who was promptly suspended from his position as head of its Intelligence Response Team. However, a group, under the aegis of the Incorporated Trustees of Northern Peace Foundation, in the heat of the investigation by the FBI, approached the court, praying it to halt any plan to extradite the embattled DCP to the US.
