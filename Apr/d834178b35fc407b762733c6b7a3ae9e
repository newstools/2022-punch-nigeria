\A youth group, Concerned Citizens of Kano State, on Thursday, purchased the Peoples Democratic Party’s Expression of Interest and Nomination forms for the embattled Chairman of Kano State Anti-corruption Commission, Muhyi Rimingado, to contest the 2023 state governorship election. The Convener of the group, Malam Nafiu Danlami, presented the forms to Rimingado in Abuja on Thursday, urging him (Rimingado) to formally declare his interest in the race. Danlami said that youths from across all the local government areas of the state voluntarily contributed N1,000 each for the purchase of the forms because they believe in Rimingado’s integrity and capacity to lead Kano. “Hundreds of Kano youths and women have mobilised themselves to Abuja to purchase these forms, both for Expression of Interest and Nomination, for governorship election for our icon and beacon of hope because we believe solely in his integrity. “We believe he is the kind of aspirant that Kano State needs to champion its affairs. We all know the problems that are bedevilling Nigeria, particularly our constituency, which is Kano State. “The youths and women particularly have mobilized themselves and are ready for the election of Rimingado,” he said. The former Chairman of the Anti-graft agency stated that since he was suspended in July 2021, he had faced serious intimidation, harassment, blackmail and threats to his life in Kano.
