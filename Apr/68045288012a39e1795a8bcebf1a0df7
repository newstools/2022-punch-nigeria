Factional governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the July 16 governorship poll of Osun State, Prince Dotun Babayemi, has urged his supporters not to entertain fear over the Independent National Electoral Commission’s recognition of Senator Ademola Adeleke as the party’s flagbearer. INEC, in the list of party candidates in the poll released on Tuesday, had listed Adeleke as the PDP governorship candidate. But Babayemi while reacting to the list in a statement titled, ‘INEC list: I’m unperturbed -Babayemi,’ signed by the Director of Media, Omooba Dotun Babayemi Campaign Organisation, Kayode Oladeji, obtained in Osogbo on Wednesday, said he had unshakable faith in the ongoing legal process regarding the PDP candidate pending before the court. The statement read in part, “There’s nothing final about the list and I’m sure that somebody somewhere knows that. It’s only the uninformed that can think it’s the end of the process because it’s on INEC’s timetable; the list published is just the submission by various parties. “Fortunately, there’s a window of opportunity provided by the new Electoral Act and that’s what we are exploring because we believe in the rule of law. Everything you are seeing is tailor-made processes which are amenable to changes when the need arises on account of judicial pronouncements.” The governorship hopeful then assured the “people of Osun that he would triumph at the court,” noting that INEC as an agency of government respects the rule of law and would act accordingly when the court makes its pronouncements on the issues at hand.
