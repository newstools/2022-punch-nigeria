Gunmen have allegedly killed two security men at St. Joseph’s Cathedral Church in Ekwulobia, Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State. It was gathered that they were killed for allegedly attending the prayer session declared by the state government on Monday. The incident occurred late on Monday, according to sources. But the state Police spokesman, Ikenga Tochukwu, who confirmed the incident to our correspondent on Tuesday, said only one person was killed. He said the bullet hit one of the church security men when hoodlums invaded the area around 10.30 pm on Monday and shot non-stop along the road close to Aguata Local Government Secretariat. Tochukwu said no arrest had been made but the command had deployed more forces in the area. He said investigations were still ongoing, adding that the security operatives would not relent in making sure the perpetrators were apprehended. An eyewitness, however, said the police were wrong to have said only one person was killed. The source further said the hoodlums ran riot in the area without any challenge from security agents. The development heightened tension in Anambra following the incessant killings in the state since last Thursday. The source said some hoodlums had warned on Sunday that people should not come out for any prayer session as directed by the state government. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
