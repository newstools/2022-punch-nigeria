Kano Pillars have condemned the action of violent fans in their NPFL match-day 23 clash against Katsina United at the Sani Abacha Stadium, Kano on Saturday. Fans suspected to be supporters of Pillars invaded the pitch in the 82nd minute of the match, as the visiting Katsina United held the hosts 0-0, damaging their team bus and carting away valuables on Saturday. Incidentally, the game was Pillars’ first at the Sani Abacha Stadium in over two years and fans trooped into the arena in their numbers to watch the team play, but the game was abandoned after things turned sour in the 82nd minute. A statement by Pillars media officer, Rilwanu Malikawa, on Sunday said the match was stopped because of the irate fans, who threw sachet water and other objects on the pitch, leading to both teams and the match officials evacuated to their dressing rooms. “The management of Kano Pillars suspects that the undesirable fans’ attitude is a gang up of some saboteurs who do not want the progress of the club,’’ the statement read. ‘’What happened on Saturday is beyond football because nothing happened before and during the time of the incident in the match; both teams and match officials were doing their primary duties on the field of play.’’ The statement noted that Pillars had a relationship with Katsina united after they recently played three of their home matches at the Muhammad Dikko Stadium, Katsina without any rancour. It added that the club management, Kano FA and the executives of Pillars fans club would not fold their arms and allow anybody found wanting to go unpunished.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
