The recently constituted caretaker committee saddled with the responsibility of managing the affairs of the Peoples Democratic Party in Osun State, on Friday took charge of the party. The PDP National Working Committee had announced a seven-member Caretaker Committee that would run the affairs of the Osun State chapter after the expiration of the tenure of its State Executive Committee. Speaking shortly after the committee members took oath of office at the party’s state secretariat in Osogbo, the Osun PDP Caretaker Chairman, Dr Akindele Adekunle, called on aggrieved members to close ranks and work for its victory in the forthcoming governorship election. He disclosed that stakeholders’ meeting had been slated for Monday, April 18, while screening of aspirants for House of Assembly and National Assembly would hold between Tuesday, 16th and Wednesday 17th of April, 2022. “Without much ado, our task is very simple and well laid out. We are to work assiduously with critical stakeholders, esteemed members of our party and the suffering masses of Osun to bring home the much awaited victory of their own government,” Akindele said.
