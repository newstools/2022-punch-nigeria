Junior Achievement Nigeria has entered into a partnership with the Central Bank of Nigeria Bankers’ Committee to spread financial literacy awareness among young people across the 36 states in the country. JAN said in a statement that members of the Bankers’ Committee visited secondary schools on Financial Literacy Day as part of the celebration to mark the global money week, with the theme, ‘Build your future, be smart about money. The statement described global money week as an annual global awareness that emphasised the importance of ensuring that young people were financially literate through information, skills, attitudes, and behaviours needed to make sound financial decisions and achieve financial well-being. It stated that this year, JAN in partnership with the Bankers’ Committee celebrated the global money week with a six-day series of events and activities, including the Financial Literacy Day in select schools across the nation. The programme, according to the statement, was designed in a way that connected diverse financial institutions to Junior Achievement Nigeria schools, and leaders in the financial institutions served as mentors to JAN students based on the financial literacy modules created by it. Commenting, the Executive Director, JAN, Foluso Gbadamosi, said “Raising children and youth to excel as financially independent adults takes intentionality. “As an organisation aware of this, every year the global money week is one we look forward to and another opportunity to invest in the lives of young people.” Copyright PUNCH.
