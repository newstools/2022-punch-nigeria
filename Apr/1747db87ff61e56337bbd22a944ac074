A former Senate President, Ken Nnamani, on Friday declared his intention to contest the 2023 presidential election under the platform of the All Progressives Congress. While promising to improve on the legacy of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), he demanded the reduction of the cost of expression of interest and nomination forms for aspirants seeking elective posts under the APC. According to Nnamani, such costs do not align with the nation’s current socio-economic realities. Nnamani who made his declaration during a press conference in Abuja said compared with other aspirants who had declared intention so far, he was the most suited for the job. Nnamani said his pedigree as the President of the Senate and Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Constitutional and Electoral Reform made him the right candidate. According to him, Nigeria faces very tough challenges now more than ever, adding that the country needs a man of tested integrity and competence to mobilise them to overcome these tough challenges. He added, “Different periods require different kinds of leadership. In 2015, we needed a Buhari to take Nigeria away from the misdirection of the Peoples Democratic Party. In 2023, we need a leader who knows how to work across the divides and lead a coalition for competent and dedicated Nigeria to lay foundations for social stability and prosperity. “In 2023, we will need a Ken Nnamani to help unite Nigeria, deepen democracy, and rebuild the social and economic infrastructure of sustainable development based on production and fair distribution.” Copyright PUNCH.
