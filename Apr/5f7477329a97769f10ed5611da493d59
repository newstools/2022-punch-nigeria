Resident doctors at the Jos University Teaching Teaching Hospital, on Thursday, lamented the level of insecurity in the country saying that the situation was affecting the performance of their members. The resident doctors, who expressed concern over the lingering situation, disclosed that in the past three weeks, two of their members were abducted. The doctors marched through the streets and threatened that they could not guarantee uninterrupted service delivery by their members if nothing was done to address the problem. Addressing journalists during the protest, the President, Association of Resident Doctors, JUTH branch, Dr. Noel Nnaegbuna, said “We want to express our displeasure in strong terms on the recent incidents of abduction of our members and the seemingly unacceptable response of the security architecture of the state in bringing a stop and lasting solution to this menace. “One worrisome concern is the abduction of two of our members in the last three weeks. These recent occurrences have caused untold mental, psychological and emotional trauma to our members and their families, and have hindered us from giving our best at our points of duty. We would have downed tools but for the sake of innocent Nigerians who will need health care services, we have resorted to a peaceful protest to convey our displeasure with recent happenings. “If this continues, we can not guarantee continuous uninterrupted service delivery by our members.” The ARD president called on the government at all levels to expedite actions in tackling the menace of insecurity. He assured that their members would continue to put the necessary pressure on the relevant agencies to see that the menace was brought to a halt. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
