The Kano State Governor, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje, on Sunday, commiserated with the families of six Islamic clerics who lost their lives in an auto crash while returning from the Sumaila Local Government Area of the state. In a press statement, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Abba Anwar, quoted his boss as saying, “The death of these gentlemen is not only a great loss to their respective family members, but to the entire state. It is a monumental tragedy. “We learnt that the clerics, led by Sheikh Alkassim Zakariyya, embarked on a tour under the auspices of the Imam Malik Islamic Foundation. “Our dear state lost people of substance, who were God-fearing. They are Sheikh Alkassim, Malam Isiya Tela, Mustapha Musa Sa’ad, Malam Ishaq Rummawa, and Malam Zakariyya Alkassim Dataka. May Allah forgive them. “On behalf of the government and people of Kano State, I am extending our condolences to their families, the Imam Malik Islamic Foundation and their friends for the great loss.”  Copyright PUNCH.
