The Osun Amotekun Corps has arrested a 33-year-old truck repairer, Afeez Odusanya, for allegedly extracting the teeth of a corpse for money ritual. He was among several suspects paraded by the corps in Osogbo on Wednesday. Giving newsmen a brief of the offences committed by the suspects, the Field Commander, Osun Amotekun Corps, Mr Amitolu Shittu, said after Odusanya was caught, 12 teeth believed to have been extracted from the corpses he exhumed for money ritual were found in his custody. Shittu, who said the suspect initially claimed to be a herbalist with specialty in money ritual, added that two finger bones were also recovered from him. The Amotekun boss explained that the suspect was living in Sagamu, Ogun State, but was caught at a burial ground in Ilesa, Osun State, while exhuming a corpse for ritual. Answering questions from our correspondent, Odusanya said he exhumed his first corpse in 2016, adding that his two previous efforts to make money through ritual failed. He said, “I was caught after I exhumed a corpse at a burial ground in Ilesa which I wanted to use for money ritual. I have been exhuming corpses since 2016 and removing their parts for money ritual, but the rites failed. “I exhumed corpses at Sagamu, Ogun State, but was caught in Osun while trying to remove the teeth of a corpse. It used to take me about 30 minutes to remove a tooth from a corpse. But after some time, it takes me lesser time because I mastered it.” Shittu said all the suspects would be handed over to the Osun command of the Department of State Services for prosecution.
