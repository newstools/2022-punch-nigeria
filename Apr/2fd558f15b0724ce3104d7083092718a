An industrialist, Olufemi Ajadi, has joined the presidential race ahead of the 2023 elections under the platform of the New Nigeria People’s Party. Ajadi, who is the Chief Executive Officer of Bullion Neat Global, a beverage drinks manufacturer and security services firm, declared formally at the NNPP national secretariat in Abuja on Thursday. This was contained in a statement made available to The PUNCH on Friday. During his declaration, Ajadi promised to bring vibrancy to political offices in the country. He said, “This is one political party which has a manifesto and agenda similar to what we have run with all this while. “It is one platform that I believe has something for the teeming Nigerian youths whom I represent first and foremost, and all other Nigerians. “The NNPP is one party that will provide us the platform to deliver dividends of democracy and value to the generality of the Nigerian people. “I am, therefore, calling on the Nigerian youths to be ready. The time has now come to make that desired change that we have been clamouring for”. Ajadi also used the opportunity to pay a courtesy call on a fellow presidential aspirant on the same platform, Rabiu Kwankwaso, in the company with the Ogun State chairman of the party, Sunday Oginni, who is also a governorship aspirant on the same platform.
