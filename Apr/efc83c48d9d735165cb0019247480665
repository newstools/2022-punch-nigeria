Nigerian Afrobeats musician, Seun Anikulapo-Kuti, has decried the attribution of violence against women and children to the African culture. Kuti took to his Instagram page, @bigbirdkuti, on Thursday, to express his disdain for people who “turn African just to beat their wives and children.” According to him, certain cultural sayings that are used to justify discrimination against certain groups in society are not African, but have their origins in “European Abrahamic proverbs.” “There is no part of African culture that encourages violence against women and children. ‘Spare the rod and spoil the child’, ‘A woman’s place is in the kitchen’, are European Abrahamic proverbs. What is the African version? “You aren’t African except in location! You don’t practice anything African except the small language you speak! Your holy land is Jerusalem and Mecca! Your most valuable possessions are your European thoughts and things! “But as soon as you want to break your equally European wife and child, you claim African.” he wrote. Copyright PUNCH.
