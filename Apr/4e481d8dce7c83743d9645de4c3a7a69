A Peoples Democratic Party presidential aspirant, Nyesom Wike, has promised to wade into a legal tussle that led to the incarceration of Yunusa Dahiru, a.k.a Yellow, jailed in Bayelsa State. A Federal High Court sitting in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, had, in 2020, sentenced Dahiru to 26 years imprisonment for child trafficking and sexual exploitation of Ese Oruru. Dahiru, in 2015, abducted Oruru in Bayelsa State, brought her to Kano State and allegedly forcefully married and impregnated her. The Rivers State Governor, who made the pledge in Kano in response to a request by the chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Kano State chapter, Shehu Sagagi, asked for details to enable him make an informed decision. Sagagi, in a welcome speech, requested the visiting presidential aspirant to, on behalf of Kano people, assist Dahiru who was languishing in jail. Sagagi stated, “Kano is disturbed by a series of events that led to the conviction of our own Yunusa Dahiru, and we decried the inhuman treatment being meted out to him in jail. In the light of this, we request the governor to intervene on this matter so dear to us here in Kano State.” Wike, in response, requested details of the case file and assured the Kano PDP stalwarts of his readiness to do everything possible within the ambit of the law to serve justice. Wike had earlier visited Governor Abdullahi Ganduje and the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
