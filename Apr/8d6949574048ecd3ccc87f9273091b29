Barely one week after a kidnapped lecturer at the Delta State University, Abraka, Professor Ovaborhene Idamoyibo died, a final-year student of the institution, Mr Chris Oghojafor, has regained his freedom from the kidnappers’ den. PUNCH Metro learnt that a ransom said to be in the range of N3m was paid. Chris, a student of Industrial Chemistry at the university, was abducted last Friday in Abraka, in the Ethiope-East Local Government Area of Delta State. Our correspondent learnt that he regained his freedom on Monday night as he was released near Ugolo-Orogun by the railway in the Ughelli South LGA of the state. A terse message on Monday from his father, John Oghojafor, a senior legislative aide to the Deputy Senate President, read, “My son, Chris Oghojafor, who was kidnapped in Abraka by Fulani herdsmen since Friday evening, has just been released. Glory be to God.” Confirming the abduction earlier, the father revealed that the kidnappers called his wife to demand a N50m ransom, but later negotiated to N3m. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe, said he was not aware of the development.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
