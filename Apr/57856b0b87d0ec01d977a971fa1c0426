A group, the Ijaw Unity Project, has condemned the reported intrusion and attack on the residence of a governorship aspirant in the 2023 general elections, Tonye Princewill, by yet-to-be identified gunmen. The group in a statement signed by its Chairman, Beks Dagogo-Jack, and Secretary, Ken Robinson, said Princewill is a prominent Ijaw son,  stating that  they would not allow anything untoward to befall him. It called on the state police command to unmask those behind the attack and make them face the law. Recall that Princewill, a governorship hopeful under the platform of the All Progressives Congress had in a statement alleged an assassination attempt on him in the wee hours of Friday. He said the gunmen broke into his GRA residence and carted away a CCTV recorder, adding that he remained their only target, and linked the incident to politics. The group’s statement read in part, “The Ijaw Unity Project described the action as barbaric and unacceptable in today’s world. It’s disheartening that some evil-minded persons want to take Rivers State back to the tragic past.’’ It urged politicians and their supporters to shun such wicked acts, and adopt peaceful and civilised approaches in the pursuit of their quest to govern Rivers State.
