The Nigerian Communications Commission, through its Computer Security Incidents Response Team for the telecoms sector, has identified two new cyber threats targeting Windows Platforms and some routers separately. This was contained in a statement issued by the NCC on Thursday, titled ‘NCC uncovers Cyber Threats to Windows Platforms, Routers’. The statement read in part, “The Computer Security Incidents Response Team set up by the Nigerian Communications Commission for the telecoms sector, has discovered two new separate cyber threats targeting Windows Platforms and a particular kind of routers respectively.” Ransomware called Lokilocker was discovered to attack Windows platforms, leading to data loss and denial of service. “The first cyber threat is a ransomware known as ‘Lokilocker’, which is capable of wiping data from all versions of Windows systems or platforms. It causes data loss, and denial of service, which reduces users’ productivity. “Lokilocker is a relatively new ransomware that has been discovered by security researchers and belongs to the ransomware family. Lokilocker operates by encrypting user files and renders the compromised system useless if the victim does not pay the demanded ransom in time,” it read. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
