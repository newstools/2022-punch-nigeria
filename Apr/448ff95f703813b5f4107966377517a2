Irate Kano Pillars fans invaded the pitch in the 82nd minute of their Nigeria Professional Football League matchday 23 fixture against Katsina United at the Sani Abacha Stadium in Kano, also damaging the visiting team’s bus and carting away valuables on Saturday. The game was the first at the Sani Abacha Stadium in over two years and fans trooped into the arena in their numbers to watch the team play however, things turned sour in the 82nd minute as the game remained goalless with few minutes to go. According to reports, the fans; angry with the result of the game encroached on the pitch harassing players of the visiting team who scampered for safety as the game was abandoned. However, they proceeded to the car park where the visiting team bus was parked and vandalized the bus – destroying the windshield. Reacting to the incident, Katsina United Media Officer, Nasir Gide, lamented the rate of destruction meted on the team. “What happened in Kano is really worrisome. The game was going smoothly, both sides were playing well and the officials were really competent but in the 82nd minute, some irate fans invaded the pitch and started attacking some of our players but we thank God nothing happened to them,” Gide told Sunday PUNCH. “Unfortunately, while we were safe, the fans went to the parking space and attacked our bus and vandalized every part as you can see from the picture. “They also got into the bus and carted away with all our bags, phones and everything we left in the bus while we left for the game. “After about two hours, we were escorted from the stadium by the security officials,” Gide added.
