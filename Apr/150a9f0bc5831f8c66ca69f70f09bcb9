A 77-year-old farmer narrowly escaped death when suspected herdsmen attacked him on his farm in the Akoko North-East Local Government Area of Ondo State. Our correspondent gathered that the victim, Benjamin  Babatunde, was working on his farm on Friday at Ikakumo when his assailants came to demand money from him. Babatunde was said to have told them that he had no money. Angered by his response, they were said to have brought out a machete which they used to inflict a cut on his head. The incident occurred barely two weeks after a middle-aged farmer was allegedly inflicted with machete cuts by some herdsmen in the same area when he prevented them from plucking cashew on his farm. A source in the area said the septuagenarian was left for dead by his attackers. “The victim was on his farm when the herders approached him, demanding money and the farmer said he had no money on the farm. The next thing was that they brought out a machete and cut him and left him in the pool of his own blood and later left the scene, thinking he was dead,” the source said. The Ikare Akoko Police Commander, Mr Muri Agbola, confirmed the incident, adding that an investigation into the matter had commenced. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
