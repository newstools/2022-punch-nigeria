The Benue State Government, on Tuesday, called on former Minister of Defence, Lt. General Theophilus Danjuma (retd.), to help interface with the Federal Government to ensure the return of displaced persons back to their ancestral homes. The Executive Secretary of State Emergency and Management Agency, Dr. Emmanuel Shior, who received the Victims’ Support Fund, a foundation headed by Danjuma in Makurdi, said what the displaced persons in the state needed now was an enduring solution to their problem so that they could return to their ancestral home. Shior lamented the massive destruction caused to infrastructures like roads, bridges, markets, schools, hospitals, and farms. He said, “What the IDPs want now is not relief materials but an enduring solution to their problem to return to their ancestral homes. “We believe that TY Danjuma is in a position to interface with the Federal Government to assist Benue State Government in doing that.” The foundation said it would expend over N1 billion in six local government areas of the state affected by the insurgency. The team leader of VSF, Mrs. Nana Tanko, said another N180 million would be spent on economic empowerment programmes for the IDPs. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
