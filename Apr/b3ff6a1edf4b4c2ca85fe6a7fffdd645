Nigerian singer, Divine Ikubor, popularly known as Rema, has revealed why he chose to undergo his tertiary education at the University of Lagos. The singer made the revelation while speaking to media personality, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, in Rubbin’ Minds show, televised on Channels TV and monitored by our correspondent. According to Rema, he chose to study at UNILAG because despite his music career, he was mostly based in Lagos. When asked why he made the decision, Rema said, “Because I live here mostly; in Lagos.” Rema recently got in the news after pleading with the Academic Staff Union of Universities to call off the strike, which has plagued Nigerian federal and state university for over two months. In the interview, Rema said he couldn’t wait for school to resume because he was in town at the moment. “I’m in town and can’t wait to check in with school,” he said. Speaking on how he’d manage his music career and schooling, Rema affirmed that once school resumed, he was going to figure it out. He said, “Most decisions I’ve made in my life, I’ll not say everything has a 100% plan. Sometimes I just go for it because I believe that I can do it however it turns out. “But sometimes I just try. If I see it doesn’t work, I just stop. But if I see it works, I move with it. But at least, I tried. That’s strength.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
