Stakeholders in the Rasaq Salinsile-led faction of the All Progressives Congress, Osun State chapter, on Monday said they would not abandon the party. They however expressed their resolve to pursue all court cases instituted against the party and the state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola. This was contained in a statement by the faction’s Publicity Secretary, Abiodun Agboola. The faction is supported by the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola. The group, which accused the Oyetola-led IleriOluwa faction of planning to blackmail its members out of the APC, also said it was jointly resolved at its stakeholders’ meeting that they would not leave the party. “We urge good-spirited Nigerians to ignore Governor Oyetola-led IleriOluwa and cohorts’ mischief that we are planning to leave the party. Our tendency is still part and parcel of Osun APC,” the statement partly read. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
