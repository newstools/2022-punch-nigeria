The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), Friday in Abuja pledged Nigeria’s support in the ongoing transition to democratic rule in the Republic of Chad. According to a statement signed late Friday by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the transition is being facilitated following the demise of the long-standing ruler, Idris Deby Itno. The statement is titled ‘President Buhari gets update on Chad’s transition’. The current leader of Chad, Mahamat Idris Deby Itno, who flew into Abuja to update the President on the ongoing process, said that there were challenges on the way but assured that they were determined to be successful. Buhari encouraged the Chadian President to proceed with the transition plan, assuring him of Nigeria’s support. The two leaders also reiterated their resolve to continue the fight against terrorism in the Lake Chad region. The closed-door meeting was attended by the two leaders, the Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Nigeria’s special envoy to the region, Babagana Kingibe and the Director-General of the National Intelligence Agency, Ahmed Abubakar.
