Manchester United’s interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has said his side need to improve ahead of the clash with rivals Liverpool and others. Rangnick said this at a post-match conference held after United secured a 3-2 home win against Norwich City on Saturday. A hat-trick by Cristiano Ronaldo helped United bag three points which felt like slipping away when Norwich equalised after going two goals down. For the games ahead, Rangnick demanded more physicality, and aggressiveness from his squad, a thing he said was lacking when it faced Norwich. The German was quoted by United’s website, “We have to focus on our own performance. The result was good, it will lift our momentum and the confidence of the team, but we have to be realistic. With that kind of performance it will be almost impossible to get something out of the away game against Liverpool, and then also away against Arsenal and home against Chelsea will be difficult. We need to play better against the ball with more physicality, with more aggressiveness. This was the biggest issue and the biggest thing that I was not happy with today.” On Ronaldo’s hat-trick, he said, “Yes, it is [remarkable]. Especially the second and third goals were brilliant goals. [He showed] a lot of physicality with the header and he was quite like against Tottenham today, the difference-maker.” Copyright PUNCH.
