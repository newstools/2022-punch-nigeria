The governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has asked all political appointees contesting elective offices in the forthcoming 2023 general election to resign from their respective positions. The governor said that the directive was to comply with Section 84 (12) of the newly amended Electoral Act. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Abba Anwar, on Sunday, Mr. Ganduje said the appointees were given between now and Monday, April 18 to tender their resignation. It was gathered that some commissioners, special advisers and even the Secretary to the State Government were all running for one elective position or the other. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the Kano State Commissioner for Water Resources, Sadiq Wali, tendered his resignation to pursue his political ambition. Reports had it that Ganduje had, however, rejected the resignation of the Managing Director of Kano Road Transport Agency, Baffa Dan’agundi. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
