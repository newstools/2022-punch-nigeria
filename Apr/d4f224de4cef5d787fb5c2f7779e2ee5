Nigerian singer, Divine Ikubor, popularly known as Rema has reacted to an open invitation by Bowen Univeristy where the institution assured the artiste that joining Bowen will save him from the Academic Staff Union of Universities strike. The PUNCH reports that the singer had earlier pleaded with ASUU to call off its ongoing strike. The Lady crooner tweeted on Monday that since his admission into the University of Lagos, he had yet to commence his studies. “ASUU, since dem give me admission I neva start school o, e don do nau!” he wrote in pidgin. Rema, who sings for Mavin Records, announced to his fans in January that he had gained admission to the University of Lagos. However, Bowen university which is located at Iwo in Osun State replied to the singer’s tweet, saying Rema won’t be delayed by ASUU strike if he joined the private institution. The tweet read, “ASUU can’t delay you if you’re enrolled in Bowen University.”  Responding to Bowen’s ‘open invitation’, Rema who described the institution as “Unilag private university”, said he was fascinated by the school’s approach. He tweeted, “Unilag private university don dey Toast me o, I’m blushing omg stop it.”  Bowen University is a private Baptist Christian Nigerian university owned and operated by the Nigerian Baptist Convention. ASUU declared a four-week warning strike on February 14, and thereafter extended the action by eight weeks in March. According to the union, the strike was due to Federal Government’s failure to implement the agreement between both parties, signed in 2009. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
