Okowa was said to have lamented that the need for consultation has become necessary, because the situation in the country was getting very troubled. He was quoted to have submitted that the troubled situation “has the capacity to destroy our economy, which is not in our best interest.” The governor added, “The country has to come together, all well-meaning people, all stakeholders must come together to think Nigeria first. We need the collective efforts of all at this period.” “This is something that is threatening the fabric of our unity and not something we have to play with.
