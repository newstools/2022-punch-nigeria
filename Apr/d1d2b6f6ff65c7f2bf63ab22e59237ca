Terrorists have killed the son of the Zamfara State Commissioner for Security, DIG Mamman Tsafe (retd.), and three others and abducted an unknown number of persons. A resident of the area, Malam Mohammed, told The PUNCH on the phone that, the terrorists who came in large numbers, invaded the residence of the security commissioner at about 8pm on Sunday. According to Mohammed, the commissioner had invited some people to his home for Ramadan breakfast when the terrorists invaded the place and shot sporadically. He said, “There were many people in the house who were invited by the commissioner to break the [Ramadan] fast when the bandits attacked the place and opened fire. “They killed four people including the commissioner’s son and took away an unspecified number of people.” The Zamfara State Commissioner of Police, CP Ayuba N. Elkana, visited the commissioner’s house on Monday to commiserate with him on the incident. Efforts to get Tsafe failed as calls from our correspondent to his number were not answered.
