The Registrar, Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply Management of Nigeria, M. Aliyu, has harped on the need for competent professionals to take charge of procurement and supply chain functions in public and private establishments. Delivering a paper on the topic: ‘Procurement and supply chain best practices: A vital component of economic development and sustainability,’ at training programme organised for members of the Institute in Osogbo, Osun State, Aliyu also identified non-adherence to laid down rules and procedures in procurement, amongst others, as reasons for Nigeria’s poor economic performance. Aliyu said that disregard for due process in procurement was aiding corruption in the country,  noting that there was an urgent need for competent professionals to take charge of procurement and supply chain functions due to its influence on the success of any nation or industry. He said, “Our present economic and managerial meltdown is simply put on the negligence of the man in understanding the challenging issues of change management and business in our chaotic contemporary era.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
