Terrorists have launched yet another attack on Gwantu Kurmi Community, the headquarters of the Sanga Local Government Area of Kaduna State, and kidnapped a student of the Kaduna State University and a passer-by, while one other person sustained injury from gunshot. The president of Gwantu People’s Progressive Union, Prince Bala Audu, who confirmed the incident to the LEADERSHIP on Monday, said Joshua Victor Arumbus of the Department of Architecture, Kaduna State University, and a passer-by, Mr. Simon, were kidnapped, while one person was critically injured. According to him, the armed men invaded the community on Saturday at around 9:13pm on foot and started shooting indiscriminately at the residents. Audu decried the increasing incidents of kidnapping within Sanga Local Government, while calling on the security agencies to improve on their response to distress calls from the communities. “It is most unfortunate that this incident happened just a half kilometre away from the Gwantu Police Divisional Headquarters and the Headquarters of the Operation Safe Haven in Gwantu,” Audu said, while calling on the Kaduna State Government to take drastic measures in curtailing the security menace ravaging the state. Audu also urged the Local Government authorities to form a local taskforce in each community within the Local Government Area that will use any available legal means in defending themselves.
