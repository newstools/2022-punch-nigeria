The former military governor of Kaduna State, Col. Abubakar Umar (retd), has decried the trending pictures of kidnapped passengers of the AK9 Abuja-Kaduna bound train by terrorists thirty days ago. Umar, who is also a social critic and Chairman of Movement for Unity and Progress, described the picture as “most disturbing”, while appealing to the Federal Government to put more effort into the immediate release of the hostages. The former governor also urged the international community, particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross, to assist in the negotiations which would be needed to effect the release of the innocent victims. According to Umar in a statement issued in Kaduna on Wednesday, “Pictures of the hostages abducted in the 28 March Abuja- Kaduna train attack are trending in the social media. “The pictures, to say the least, are most disturbing, particularly as they show exhausted and frightened women and children under the most harrowing conditions. “I appeal to the Federal government to do more to secure the immediate release of these innocent victims. “I also appeal to the international community, particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to assist in the negotiations which will be needed to effect that release. “May God touch the hearts of the kidnappers to show mercy on these innocent and vulnerable victims. Amen.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
