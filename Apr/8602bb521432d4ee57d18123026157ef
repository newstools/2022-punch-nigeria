Zamfara State Government has dethroned two traditional rulers for their alleged involvement in banditry. The affected traditional rulers are the Emir of Zurmi, Alhaji Abubakar Atiku, and the Emir of Dansadau, Alhaji Husaini Umar. Also dismissed was the district head of Birnin Tsaba, Alhaji Suleiman Ibrahim. The state Commissioner for Information, Ibrahim Dosara, disclosed this at a press conference on Wednesday. He said the monarchs were found guilty of all the allegations leveled against them. Dosara said, “After going through the reports submitted to the state government by the two committees, the state government has found it necessary to implement the committee’s recommendations. “Based on the recommendations, the two Emirs, Alhaji Abubakar Atiku of Zurmi Emirate and Alhaji Husaini Umar of Dansadau Emirate are hereby dethroned. “Similarly, the district head of Birnin Tsaba, Alhaji Suleiman Ibrahim, has also been dismissed.” The commissioner added that all the lands allocated by the two Emirs have been revoked. The PUNCH reported that the two Emirs were suspended by the state government in June and were kept at the Government House, Gusau. They were taken before a court last week following a series of complaints from both the families of the two Emirs and civil society organisations. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
