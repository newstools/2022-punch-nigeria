A communal crisis in Niger State has led to the death of one Mohammed Yan-Nda and the destruction of properties worth millions of naira. The clash which was said to have been caused by a land dispute occurred in Doko community in Lavun Local Government Area of the state. The communal clash between Boku and Doko communities has been a long standing land dispute that has remained unresolved. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Wasiu Abiodun, in a statement, confirmed the incident, adding that it was a reprisal. “The hoodlums mobilised to Mohammed’s residence in reprisal of the injury sustained by the victim and lynched him while they equally vandalised some of his property and some neighbouring houses and fled the scene,” the statement read in part.
