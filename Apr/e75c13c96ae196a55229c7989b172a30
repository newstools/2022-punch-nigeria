Chimerie, a brother to the late gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu, has said that the late ‘Ekwueme’ singer refused to divorce her husband, Peter Nwachukwu, because her followers might perceive her negatively if she quit the relationship. The brother added that she did not want people to describe her as a divorced minister. According to Chiemerie, Nwachukwu killed the singer slowly. Speaking with journalists, Chiemerie said, “I knew Osinachi very well. She was very quiet and God-fearing. “She was just hiding all those things, so people would not talk about her and say she was divorced. The man dealt with her and she died slowly.” Recall that Chimerie reported a case of culpable homicide against Nwachukwu to the Nigeria Police, Federal Capital Territory command, which led to his arrest on April 10, 2022. The gospel singer had died two days earlier on April 8, 2022.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
