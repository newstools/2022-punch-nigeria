The Independent Investigation Panel on Human Rights Violations by the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad and other units of the Nigerian Police Force on Monday issued a warrant of arrest against the Commissioner of Police, Legal Services, Force Headquarters, CP Igbeh Ochogwu, in respect of the alleged unlawful arrest and detention of John Alozie since June 25, 2017. The CP was on several occasions ordered to appear before the panel with Alozie’s case file but he had so far refused to honour the summons. According to a statement on Monday, the panel’s Chairman, Justice Suleiman Galadima (retd.), who issued the arrest warrant, described Ochogwu’s attitude as unbecoming of a lawyer and police officer. The statement read, “The jurist said the only option left for the panel is to issue a warrant of arrest on the CP Legal and mandate the National Human Rights Commission to write to the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee to report Ochogwu’s conduct in the matter. “The chairman noted that the CP has flagrantly and repeatedly disobeyed the order of the panel, having refused to turn in the said case file to enable the panel to unravel the truth about the whereabouts of Alozie in accordance with the law.” It would be recalled that the wife of the victim, Alozie had testified that a high court had ordered the police to release the victim and the order was never obeyed to date. The panel adjourned hearing on the petition till April 27, 2022, for a progress report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
