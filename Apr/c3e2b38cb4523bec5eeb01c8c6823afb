Hyundai Nigeria Limited has launched a new Santa Fe Sport Utility Vehicle and Elantra saloon into Nigeria’s market. The company said compared with the models they replaced, the two vehicles came with improved styling, comfort, equipment, and segment-leading safety features. Addressing newsmen at a media launch at the Hyundai showroom, Victoria Island, Lagos, the company’s Head of Sales and Marketing, Mr. Gaurav Vashisht, described the new Santa Fe as a product of continuous research into making Hyundai vehicles safer and more comfortable for customers. Vashisht said, “Hyundai Santa Fe has made a brilliant start to the new year, gaining wide recognition by top tier global automotive awards, winning top titles in Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Award, Large SUV of the Year at 2022 What Car? Award, and United States News 2022 Best Car for the Money, affirming the Santa Fe as an innovative choice among large SUVs in combining family convenience with an adventurous unrivaled presence on the road.” Also, he said the all-new, seventh-generation, Hyundai Elantra, had undergone significant changes, delivering the most progressive in-vehicle experience in its class. He said “Longer, wider, and more aggressive than the sixth-generation model, the 2022 Elantra boasts a wide range of advanced technologies and features. It marks another step forward for the Elantra brand, which first hit the roads 30 years ago (1990). “Bringing the Elantra to life is the premium finishing to both the exterior and interior, reflected through Hyundai’s ‘Sensuous Sportiness’ design identity. The Elantra is also equipped with an elaborative design chassis, allowing the driver to experience the sporty feel of the design.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
