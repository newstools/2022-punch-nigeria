As the 2023 general election draws closer, a group under the aegis of Delta Youth Coalition, has called on Deltans to resist imposition of candidates. The President-General of the group, Mr. Chibuzor Agunwa, made the call on Thursday while speaking to our correspondent in Asaba. He urged Deltans to support deepening democracy in the state by resisting imposition of candidates. He said, “I am calling on Deltans to ensure that they come out en masse to vote for the leaders of their choice and resist any imposition of candidates. “I commend the leadership of Independent National Electoral Commission for the new electoral law on electronic transmission of election results which will reduce to the barest minimum the high cases of electoral fraud. “Time has come for the citizens to exercise their civic and constitutional rights by voting out corrupt politicians, choose who becomes the leader and install credible leaders in Delta state and Nigeria in general for good governance and participatory democracy in the rural communities. “We have gone round, sensitized the grassroots, we are mobilising youths and women across the 25 LGAs of Delta State. We have a standard website for membership drive” Agunwa said the group had recorded great achievements in Delta State since its formation; as it has structures in the 25 LGAs of the state.
