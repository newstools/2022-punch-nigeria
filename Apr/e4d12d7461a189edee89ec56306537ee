Anambra State Governor, Chukwuma Soludo, on Saturday swore in 20 commissioners with a charge that they should get ready for service. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that those sworn into office were cleared earlier by the State House of Assembly. Soludo, who performed the function at the state Executive Council Chamber, Government House, Awka, charged them to deliver optimal services to the people of Anambra. He said his administration would declare a state of emergency in all the sectors, starting with security. “All sectors will be given due attention beginning with security which we have already started doing something,” he said. Soludo said the assignment of portfolio to each of the new commissioners before the swearing-in was a clear departure to known tradition. He said that the commissioners were selected based on their areas of specialisation. “More than 22, 000 persons applied to serve, out of which more than 1, 000 indicated interest to serve as commissioners,” Soludo said. Among those sworn in by the governor is Rtd Air-Vice Marshal Ben Chiobi, as a special adviser on security matters. He urged the appointees to abide by their oath of office and discharge their duties as they have been appointed to do. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
