The Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu,  has told presidential aspirant Rotimi Amaechi that the ambition of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu remains the “rallying point” of Lagos. Sanwo-Olu said this while receiving the Minister of Transportation yesterday, in Marina, Lagos. Both Amaechi and the former Governor of Lagos, Tinubu, are presidential aspirants under the All progressives Congress. Sanwo-Olu, who said he was a “direct beneficiary” of Tinubu’s leadership, said the state would support the former governor in his ambition for presidency come 2023. He, however, noted that Amaechi was equally qualified. In his words, “I have sheer regard and respect for our leader, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu. I have been a direct beneficiary of his leadership. I have been part of his cabinet,” he said. “Personally I continue to tow that line of leadership and what he stands for.” “I want to say to you that you’re eminently qualified and I want to wish you well in this journey. Clearly, for all of us in Lagos State, Asiwaju continues to be our rallying point, but the country is our country and we must continue to see it as the one that is indivisible and one that we all rally around. “I certainly know too well what your pedigree is and what you have done,” the governor said. Amaechi, who also responded, said that it was not easy for him to come to Lagos, understanding that their national leader, Tinubu, was from there. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
