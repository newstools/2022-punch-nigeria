Medplus Pharmacy, a health and beauty retailer, has offered free medical services to no fewer than sixty underprivileged children from the Chess In Slums Initiative at Oshodi Underbridge. In a statement made available to our Correspondent in Lafia on Thursday, Brand Manager of Medplus Pharmacy, Christiana Aileru, said the gesture was aimed at enhancing and promoting a healthy living for the underprivileged children. She said, “Medplus Pharmacy in partnership with Chess In Slums decided to carryout free medical check ups for the children from the Chess In Slums Initiative at Oshodi Underbridge, Lagos State. “Our team consisting of Doctors, Pharmacists and Dentists were on ground and we attended to about sixty children who were diagnosed with one illness or the other. “The children were given free malaria drugs, Vitamin C, eye drops, iron tablets, calcium boosting medication, magnesium supply for the heart, nerves, and muscles, oral hygiene products, and other useful vitamin medications for their general well being”. While commending the Founder of Chess In Slums, Tunde Onakoya, for coming up with the initiative which would help the children find life-changing opportunities through chess educational resources and mentorship, Aileru said Medplus Pharmacy would now hold the outreach in November every year. “Medplus Pharmacy which is an organization that is deeply devoted to reaching out to the vulnerable in the society, believes that wellness is not just physical, but should cater to the mind and spirit, which was why we partnered with Chess in Slums to impact positively in the lives of the children at Oshodi Underbridge, and we hope to do more in the coming months,” the statement added.
