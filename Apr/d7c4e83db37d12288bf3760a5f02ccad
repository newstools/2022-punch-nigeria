The National Youth Service Corps has said about 23 corps members deployed in Anambra State will repeat their service year. The State NYSC Coordinator, Blessing Iruma, stated this on Thursday, during the passing out ceremony of the 2021 Batch ‘A’ (stream11), corps members held at the Washington Memorial Grammar School, Onitsha, Anambra State. Iruma, while congratulating the outgoing corps members, regretted that 23 will be repeating their service, while five others will have their service periods extended in the state. Iruma said the affected corps members defaulted at various times during their service year and urged them to turn a new leaf. She added that certificates had been issued to corps members at the various local government NYSC offices across the 21 local government areas of the state. She said that 2,701 corps members who successfully completed their services were issued discharge certificates. She said, “My dear corps members, as you go forward in life, I urged you to shun corruption and sharp practices, internet fraud, get-rich-quick syndrome, and other vices that can only destroy your lives. Remember that God rewards decency and hard work. “NYSC as a scheme, will stop at nothing to recognize and celebrate hard work and accomplishments, be it academic, entrepreneurial, or innovations. “I am aware of the usual fear of unemployment that grips some unprepared ones but the scheme has prepared you with skills and funding options for post-service challenges. “Endeavor to remain focused and relevant at all times. I, therefore, charge you to step into the world with confidence and the Almighty God will definitely bless the work of your hands if you are diligent.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
