Newly elected chairman of the Social Democratic Party in Kwara State, Abdulazeez Afolabi, has said the party is sure of victory in the forthcoming elections in the state adding that it will use the 2019 ‘O to ge’ (Enough is enough) tactics to drive out the All Progressives Congress from the state government House in the 2023 general elections. Speaking in an interview on Tuesday after the inauguration of the SDP executive, who emerged from the party congress held at its state secretariat, Abdulazeez said the 2023 elections would be won easily by his party, adding that the current political dispensation in the state was different and peculiar. Abdulazeez, who said that the Kawara SDP was dominated by the people known as ‘APC Loyal’; referring to those who recently defected from the APC, said that the victory of the current governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq was planned and hatched by a majority of the people now in the SDP. He said, “We will replicate the ‘o to ge’ movement of 2019 elections against the APC-led government in the 2023 governorship and other elections in Kwara State. “The victory of the current Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq in 2019 was facilitated by our group when we were together in APC. “We were the strong advocates of the ‘O to ge’ movement. Even though we moved out of APC, we still have our structures across all the 16 Local Government Areas of the state. We believe that we will forge ahead”. According to him, victory in the 2023 general elections in the state will be greatly influenced by the personality of individual candidates presented by each party. Copyright PUNCH.
