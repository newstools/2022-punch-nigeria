The Chairman of the Nigeria Governor’s Forum and the Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has declared that his Ogun State counterpart, Dapo Abiodun, deserves to be elected for a second term in office. Fayemi said the governor had performed beyond imagination. Fayemi, who said this on Thursday in Abeokuta during a visit to Abiodun, noted that “as Chairman of the Governor’s Forum, I was elected to protect and to promote every governor who is a member of my forum, so, you shouldn’t be surprised if I want him back. “I am sure you saw me when the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), came to commission projects here, that in itself is a statement of what I think of the great work our governor is doing within the short space of time he has been in office.” Fayemi also commended the governor for his extensive knowledge of the investment terrain, saying, he  has attracted huge foreign direct investment into the state. He said “he has demonstrated capacity, he has increased investment, naturally, this is a state that attracts more investment than the rest of us, those of us in the hinterland, because it is close to Lagos. But, on top of that, he has brought to bare his business acumen, his extensive knowledge of the investment terrain to attract a lot more investment.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
