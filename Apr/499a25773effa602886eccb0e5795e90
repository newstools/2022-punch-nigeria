In this episode of So This Happened, we reviewed the viral sexual scandal involving students of Chrisland schools. It all reportedly started from a game of Truth or Dare. Also reviewed, was the plea by singer Rema to the Academic Staff Union Of Universities, begging them to call off the ongoing strike. Lastly, there’s a Yoruba adage, that says chickens don’t eat each other’s innards. That was not the case with the FCT Administration and some government ministries. What happened? Watch till the end.
