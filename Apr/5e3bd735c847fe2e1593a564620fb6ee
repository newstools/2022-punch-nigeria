A presidential aspirant under the Peoples Democratic Party and Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, has appointed the former chairman of the PDP caretaker committee, Senator Tunde Ogbeha, as his campaign chairman. The development was made known to journalists in a statement signed by the media aide to the Sokoto State Governor, Muhammad Bello, on Friday in Sokoto, which noted that the appointment took immediate effect. Ogbeha, who hails from Kogi State, was a Brigadier General in the Nigerian Army who was administrator of Akwa Ibom State and then of Bendel State during the regime of General Ibrahim Babangida. At Nigeria’s return to democracy in 1999, he served as the Senator representing Kogi West senatorial district for two terms. The statement read in part, “Senator Ogbeha is expected to deploy his vast experience in administration, public policy and politics to the campaign and will chair meetings of the Tambuwal Campaign Council. He will help set up priorities and give direction to the campaign.” After serving as a legislator, Ogbeha became Chairman of the Confluence Cable Network, Kogi State’s first private broadcasting station. In 2009, he was appointed to the Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission, representing the non-oil-producing North Central region by President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua. Copyright PUNCH.
