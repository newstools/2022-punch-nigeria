The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, has declared a governorship aspirant, Farah Dagogo, wanted for hiring cultists to attack the Peoples Democratic Party secretariat in Port Harcourt on Wednesday. The PUNCH gathered that some party members had protested at the state secretariat located along the Aba expressway over alleged exclusion. Our correspondent also learnt that officials of the PDP national secretariat had arrived in Port Harcourt to begin the screening of aspirants for the Senate. As the protest rose to a fever pitch, a team of policemen reportedly arrived at the scene, shot into the air to disperse them, and arrested some persons. Dagogo represents the Bonny-Degema federal constituency in the House of Representatives. Wike in a statement by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, directed the state Police Command to arrest Dagogo for the alleged act. The statement reads, “The governor has hereby directed the Rivers State Police Command to arrest Hon. Farah Dagogo for hiring cultists who stormed the PDP secretariat in Port Harcourt, and disrupted the screening of aspirants for various elective positions. “The Police must as a matter of urgency arrest Farah Dagogo, wherever he i, and must be made to face prosecution.” “Already, some of the hoodlums hired by Farah Dagogo have been arrested and will be made to face the full wrath of the law.” Copyright PUNCH.
