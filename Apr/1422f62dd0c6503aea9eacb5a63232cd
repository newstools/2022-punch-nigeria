A comprehensive new study involving more than 13,000 patients suggests that the best treatments for chronic back pain should cover both physical and mental aspects – rather than concentrating solely on physical remedies. The report which was recently published in the peer-reviewed journal The BMJ conflates a systematic review of 97 previous trials covering 17 different approaches to handling chronic back pain. Researchers found that adding psychological interventions to treatments – mainly behavioural therapy and pain education – led to the most sustainable benefits for both physical function and pain intensity.
