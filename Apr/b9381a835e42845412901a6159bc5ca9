Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has told his Rivers State counterpart, Nyesom Wike, that he (Wike) won’t actualise his presidential ambition. The Cable reported that Ganduje spoke on Monday when Wike visited him at the Government House in Kano. Receiving the Peoples Democratic Party presidential aspirant, Ganduje reportedly said, “I have listened to your speech across the country and I said, ‘This Wike is not wicked, but this Wike is wise.’ “So, you have come to see your brothers and sisters. Good. You are aspiring for the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. We see your efforts. “And at the end of it, you would lose, but you will be a good loser. I appreciate good losers because they have courage and since you are doing it peacefully, you will live long to fight again. “In a democracy, if we all belong to one party, then there is no democracy and I foresee good efforts in your presidential bid. You will lose, but you will be a good loser and live to fight a good fight.” Ganduje said the country’s diversity should be an advantage, adding that every person has the responsibility of driving change.
