Gunmen on Friday morning attacked the country home of the Imo State Commissioner for Labour, Employment, and Productivity, Ford Ozumba. The incident which happened at Umuhu Okabia Community in Orsu Local Government Area of the state caused panic in the area as villagers fled to safety. Although no life was lost during the attack, our correspondent gathered that property worth millions was lost to the inferno. Ozumba, who spoke to journalists, admitted said that no life was lost during the attack, adding that “there was nobody in the house at the time of the attack”. The commissioner said that he was informed that the attackers threw a petrol bomb into the compound and burnt the house. He said “We were all in Owerri only to learn this morning that my family house had been burnt down. I was told that the attackers wreaked havoc in the dead of the night. They threw a petrol bomb into the compound. “What a sad day. My family compound in my village has been razed down by hoodlums last night.” Ozumba becomes the third commissioner in the cabinet of Governor Hope Uzodimma to have his home attacked and burnt by gunmen. The homes of the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Cyprian Akaolisa, and Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, were burnt in 2021. The Imo State Police Command’s spokesperson, Micheal Abattam, had yet to respond to an inquiry concerning the incident. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
