The Inter-Party Advisory Council has threatened to boycott local government elections if political parties engage in any form of discrimination. This was contained in a 10-point communiqué signed by National Secretary/Chairman, Communiqué Drafting Committee, Yusuf Dantalle, after a three-day retreat organised by IPAC in partnership with the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies in Lagos. The communiqué partly read, “At the end of the highly engaging retreat, the followings were resolved upon: “To simultaneously embark on aggressive advocacy, pursue an appropriate legal framework at the National Assembly and ensure a nationwide boycott of local government elections to entrench credibility and provide a level playing field for free, fair, peaceful and transparent elections where it matters most. “The development of an implementable strategic plan for IPAC within the remaining life-span of the current leadership built around a clear-cut vision, mission and objective.” Copyright PUNCH.
