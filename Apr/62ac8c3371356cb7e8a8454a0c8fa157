THE Lagos State Deputy Governor, Dr Obafemi Hamzat, has urged citizens to properly bring up their children as a measure to curb prevailing social vices. Hamzat said this, according to a statement on Sunday, during the 17th late Justice Muri-Okunola Memorial Ramadan lecture held at Ikeja. He said, “We need to reinforce that as parents, we need to take care of our kids and be conscious of what is going on in our environment. I think that is what we need to do as well as make sure that every one of us can account for the activities of our children. The problem we are facing today is that we are not doing what is expected of us as people and we lack good parenting. We must do the right thing, if not, there will be no peace. “The quick money syndrome among young Nigerians is morally and spiritually wrong. People involved in devilish acts for the sake of money should know that there are negative consequences for such endeavour.” A lecturer in the Department of Religious and Peace Studies, Lagos State University, Ojo, Dr Mustapha Bello, urged parents to give their children spiritual education. “Parents should properly bring up their children and they should be mindful of the kind of friends and companies their children keep, give them spiritual education. If parents raise their children in a godly way, they will be good to them during their lifetime and thereafter,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
