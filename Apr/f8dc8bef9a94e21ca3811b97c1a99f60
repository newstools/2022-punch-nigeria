Super Eagles forward Victor Osimhen has been voted as Napoli’s best player for the month of March, Sunday PUNCH reports. In a vote that was carried out by the club’s fans, the 23-year-old forward emerged winner as the Parthenopeans player of the month for March. The award adds to his recent award where he also won Serie A Player of The Month for March. In the month under review, the Nigerian striker, who has been in fantastic form for the Italian outfits, scored four goals in his last three games for the Naples side. It wasn’t the best start of the month for Luciano Spalletti’s men after losing their top-of-the-table clash with AC Milan 1-0 at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium before bouncing back with wins against Verona and Udinese where Osimhen scored a brace in each of the games. After claiming the highest vote to be crowned the best player of the month, the club congratulated the striker on its Twitter handle. “The March Player of the Month as voted for by fans on @SociosItalia is Victor Osimhen. #ForzaNapoliSempre,” reads a tweet on Napoli’s official Twitter handle. Despite a season plagued by injury, Osimhen remains Napoli’s top scorer with 12 goals in 22 league appearances. Osimhen will look to add to his current goal tally when Napoli travels to Empoli on Sunday. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
