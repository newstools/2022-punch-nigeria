A burglar has been declared wanted for allegedly looting a house in the Lagos Island area of Lagos State. The suspect was said to have carted away jewellery, gold, among other items. PUNCH Metro gathered that the alleged thief was captured making away with the valuables on the Closed Circuit Television camera installed on the premises. A family friend of the victim, Leke Adebanjo, said it was not the first time that the suspect would raid houses in the community. He said, “That guy stole very valuable things from the house and we are sad that this happened. We learnt that the same guy had been stealing things around the neighbourhood, but what he did not know was that there’s a CCTV camera in the house. “He thought that it was just another house he could go to and steal, but this time, he would be nailed because we have his identity and it will not be business as usual.” He said N2m had been placed on the suspect. The state police spokesperson, Benjamin Hundeyin, who confirmed the incident, said policemen were on the trail of the suspect. He said, “The case was reported to us and we will do our duty; the burglar will be caught. After the matter was reported to us, our men have been on the lookout for  him and we will get him arrested.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
