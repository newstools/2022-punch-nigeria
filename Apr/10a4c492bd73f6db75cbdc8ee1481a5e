THE final year students of the Department of Mass Communication, Yaba College of Technology, Lagos, have used its photo exhibition programme to educate Nigerians on the hoaxes of social media. With over 72 pieces of photo art on display, the students were able to communicate effectively to visitors the falsehood of the exuberant and luxurious lifestyle constantly displayed on social media. The photo exhibition which showcased their creativity through photos portrayed social media as a tool that promoted fake life. The Rector, Engr. Femi Omokungbe, who was represented by the Sub-dean of the Department of Mass communication, Mr Sule Olatunji, commended the students for using pictures as a medium to fight against fake lifestyle on social media, saying many youths were being carried away by the illusion presented by the social media. He said “This has been the best photo exhibition so far in the history of student exhibition at Yabatech, and I really commend the aura of teamwork emitting from the students, to see that this exhibition is a success. It is good to see that they are able to use pictures to pass strong and meaningful messages to our society. It is impressive how they dissuade youths from patronising the hoaxes that social media flaunts.” Furthermore, the rector called on other academic departments in the college to borrow a leaf from the Department of Mass Communication and nurture the potential of students.
