THE Oyo State Police Command has begun an investigation into the robbery attack at Fresh FM, Ibadan, a private room radio station owned by a musician, Yinka Ayefele. The Public Relations Officer for the Oyo State Police Command, Adewale Osifeso, told our correspondent on Sunday that the police had begun an investigation into the incident. He said, “Investigations have commenced immediately. Updates will be provided accordingly.” Our correspondent gathered that the radio station was on a live broadcast when the hoodlums struck and carted away laptop computers, phones,  and personal belongings of members of staff around. A member of staff of the radio station told our correspondent that the robbers invaded the station located in the Challenge area of Ibadan at around 6.30am. He said, “I was not on duty when the incident happened but some of my colleagues who were around said the hoodlums came early morning, today( Sunday).” “I was told they stole laptop computers, phones and other handy valuables but nobody was injured or killed.” Recall that some hoodlums on reprisal attack had in July 2021  invaded the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria at Moniya, Ibadan. The hoodlums, who were searching for members of Soludero Hunters who attacked them earlier vandalised vehicles and properties of the media house when they could not find their targets.
