Soldiers are still occupying the Okporo, Ihuoma and Amaifeke communities in the Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State days after the clash between troops and bandits. Residents of the area, according to our correspondent, had fled their homes with businesses almost grounded following the development. An indigene of one of the communities, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said some others had taken refuge in the bush. He stated, “The soldiers are still in the Amaifeke, Okporo and Ihuoma communities. They are still there and there is panic everywhere. Our people are in fear. Businesses are grounded. Some are in the bush, others are indoors and there are those who managed to leave the communities. “Our communities are bleeding. Orlu is crying. Our parents are stranded and things are falling apart. The fear of the soldiers is the beginning of wisdom. Our land cries for justice and we believe that God will hear our cries and prayers.” Recall that bandits and soldiers on Sunday clashed in the areas for close to three hours which led to the burning of a brothel, the destruction of vehicles and killing of some indigenes of the communities. One of those killed, which eventually sparked off protests on social media, was a musician, Roco Nnadiekwe. Nnadiekwe, 38, was billed to shoot a video of his latest single on Monday before he was shot dead on Sunday. A teenager and a woman were also killed during the attack, with villagers insisting that the number of those killed were higher than the reported casualty. But the military authority had said those who were killed were members of the Indigenous people of Biafra and its militant wing, Eastern Security Network operatives. Copyright PUNCH.
