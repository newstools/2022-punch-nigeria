The All Progressives Congress stakeholders in the Irepodun and Orolu Local Government Areas of Osun State, on Monday, warned against ceding of the party’s Osun Central Senatorial ticket and that of Osogbo Federal Constituency to Osogbo and Olorunda Local Government Areas. This warning was contained in a communique issued after a meeting held by the group, which compromises of party’s ward executive committee and local government executives from the two local government areas in Ilobu on Monday. The communique, read by the Secretary of the APC in the Osogbo Federal Constituency, Abayomi Oyedeji, then called on the Osun State governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, ex-governor Bisi Akande, and the APC state chairman, Gboyega Famoodun, to intervene and call to order those behind the plot. It further read in part, “Specifically, we support the zoning of the Senate to either Osogbo Local Government Area or Olorunda Local Government Area, and the zoning of member representing the Federal Constituency at the House of Representatives to either Irepodun Local Government Area or Orolu Local Government Area to ensure justice, fairness and equity. “We wish to point out that whoever thinks that the Osogbo Local Government Area or Olorunda Local Government Area will grab and snatch from us the candidacy of the member of the House of Representatives for the next National Assembly elections is deliberately nursing a motive that will destabilise the Federal Constituency. The move, if it is true, will be resisted with all means at our disposal as integral parts of the Federal Constituency.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
