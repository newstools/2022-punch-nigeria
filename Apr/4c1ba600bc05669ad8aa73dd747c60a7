Nigerian rapper, Folarin Falana, popularly known as ‘Falz’, has revealed that he has never said “I love you” to any girl in his life before. The Bop Daddy crooner revealed this in an interview with media personality, Taymesan, where he talked about his love life. A clip of the interview shared by Taymesan on Friday showed Falz stating that he has not been romantically involved with any woman. “I’ve never been in love. I’ve never said to a woman, in a romantical way, that, ‘I’m in love with you’. I’ve never,” he said. Falz added, “I’ve never said I love you to a girl.” When asked where he got inspiration for his love songs from, he noted that an artiste was meant to be creative. He said, “As an artiste, you need to have a canvas. When you have a canvas, you have different colours of paints, and you just splash it.” He, however, revealed that he hasn’t opened himself to any relationship recently. “I closed the door because I wasn’t ready,” Falz revealed.
