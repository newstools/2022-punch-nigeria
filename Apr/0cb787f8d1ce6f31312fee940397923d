An angry mob on Monday attempted to lynch a suspected kidnapper after he was reportedly recognised by one of his victims and grabbed by residents of Idi-Ori, in the Abeokuta North Local Government Area of Ogun State. Our correspondent learnt that the suspect was walking around the area when he was recognised by the victim, who raised the alarm. An eyewitness, who identified herself simply as Olubukola, said the victim claimed that the suspect received ransom from him and others in the area. The witness told our correspondent that irate youths descended on the young man, beating him blue and black. Olubukola said, “They tied his hands and legs. They beat him and gave him a bloody nose. He might have been lynched if not for the arrival of the police from the Lafenwa division in Abeokuta. “At first, the irate youths did not want to release him to the police. They said they didn’t trust the police. Their fear is that he may be released on bail.” The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident. However, Oyeyemi said the man remained a suspect as investigation was ongoing on the allegations levelled against him. The police spokesman said, “The man is still a suspect until investigation is concluded. This is why it is not good for people to take the law into their hands. You cannot just carry somebody and make attempts to kill the person. They should let us investigate his culpability. “And even if we are able to find out that he is a kidnapper, he cannot be alone. Our investigation will lead us to the arrest of others. So that in that axis, the syndicate will be dismantled once and for all.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
