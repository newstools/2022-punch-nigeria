Shooting Stars defender, Chidera Ezeh, says they will be targeting the maximum points when they welcome struggling Lobi Stars to Ibadan for their matchday 23 fixture on Saturday. The Oluyole Warriors are currently 12th on the league table, four points from the relegation zone while visiting Lobi are in the relegation zone. The hosts who are without a win in their last three league games missed the opportunity to beat Gombe United in Ibadan a situation which didn’t go well with the fans. However, Ezeh is confident that they will get the maximum points in the game for the fans who have stood by them through the turbulent 2021/22 campaign. “We can’t afford anything less than a convincing win on Saturday (today) because we don’t want a repeat of what happened during our last home game against Gombe United, where our fans left unhappy. “We want to win this for our teeming supporters and fans to make them happy and also to make them believe in us.” Ezeh who recently joined the club from Gombe United during the mid-season break scored his maiden goal for the club in their 2-1 loss to Akwa United says he is hoping to get on this weekend. “I am personally inspired to go for another goal come Saturday when we meet Lobi Stars, but ultimately, the main target for us as a team, is the maximum points, which we will surely get,” Ezeh added.
