Plateau United on Monday missed the opportunity to go top of the Nigeria Professional Football League after playing a 1-1 draw at Kwara United in their match-day 22 fixture, while Akwa United ended a five-game winless run beating Shooting Stars 2-1. Fidelis Ilechukwu’s side faced a tough test in Ilorin and needed to grab the maximum points to leapfrog leaders Rivers United, who have a date at Katsina United on Wednesday. However, it was Samad Kadiri who grabbed the opener for Kwara in the 14th minute, but the lead lasted just two minutes as Wasiu Jimoh grabbed the equaliser for the visitors. The result comes as a blow for Plateau, with Rivers having a chance to go four points clear if they win at Katsina. Meanwhile, at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium, Uyo, Akwa United recorded their first win in six league games with a 2-1 triumph over struggling Shooting Stars. Babatunde Bello put Akwa in front in the 14th minute, before Naibe Akpesiri made it 2-0 in the 69th minute. However, it was a nervy ending for the champions after Chidera Eze put one back for the visitors in the 81st minute, but the Uyo-based side held on for a win. Abdulazeez Yusuf (33), Ahmed Jimoh (40), Sani Abbani (74) were on the score sheet as hosts Gombe United humbled Nasarawa United 3-1 at the Pantami stadium, with Aliyu Abdullahi scoring the consolation goal for the visitors in the 51st minute. The victory moves Gombe to ninth on the league table. On Tuesday (today), Heartland entertain Remo Stars. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
