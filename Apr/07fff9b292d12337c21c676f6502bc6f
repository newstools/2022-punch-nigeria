The firm said the recommendation represented a 100 per cent payout with a total dividend of N1.60k per ordinary share of 50kobo each. Having been paid an interim dividend of N0.40k in December 2021, shareholders of the company were expected to receive a final dividend of N1.20k each on 22nd April 2022. Speaking at the pre- annual general meeting media briefing in Lagos, the Managing Director of the company, Mr Hans Essaadi, described the 100 per cent dividend payout recommendation as evidence of the company’s commitment to delivering superior value to its shareholders in terms of dividends. The company’s 2021 financial year result showed that it recorded net revenue of N437.2bn, from N337.01bn recorded in the previous year.
