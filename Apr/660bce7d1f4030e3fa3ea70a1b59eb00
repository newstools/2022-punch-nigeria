It goes without saying that there has been an uptick in the cases of money ritual in the country, especially among teenagers and youths. This has led many to say that Nollywood films which glorify ritual killings are partly to blame. However, in separate interviews with some entertainers, they disagreed. In an interview with Sunday Scoop, actor, Femi Branch, said, “We are at a serious low in the nation. Morals have been thrown out of window, and social media has not helped at all. “Celebrities cannot be said to be the ones influencing the youth to engage in money rituals. Entertainers are hardworking, and everybody knows what they do.” In a similar vein, another actor, Eso Dike, said, “If one works hard, earns good money and flaunts it, that should not have a (negative) impact on the next person. I advise people not to base their lives on what they see on social media, because most times, actors are only bringing fictional characters to life.” Another actor, Olumide Oworu, said, “The fact that life in Nigeria is getting harder is the reason (people are engaging in different vices). At the end of the day, the entertainment industry is a reflection of what is going on in society. “If there are many stories about young people trying to get rich quick, Nollywood should be acknowledged for bringing such stories to the fore. Those stories will help the government realise that they have to provide jobs and other amenities for citizens.” Comedian and actor, Greg Ojefua, also said, “It is a fallacy. Rather than encourage money ritual, Nollywood actually discourages it. In movies where the characters engage in money rituals, they reap the consequences of their actions and don’t go unpunished.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
