A former aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, on Sunday, predicted the outcome of the 2023 presidential election and the chances of both ruling All Progressives Congress and Peoples Democratic Party ahead of the exercise. He said that should the APC zoned its presidential ticket to South West region, the main opposition party would lose the election if it zoned its ticket to a region with lover voting strength. In a tweet on his Twitter handle on Sunday, the former presidential aide and staunch critic of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) regime, analysed the 2019 election with voter numbers to back his prediction. According to him, politics is a game of numbers, not sentiments. He wrote, “The 2019 election by voter numbers: NW: 8.2 M
NC: 4.4 M
NE: 4.3 M
SW: 3.8 M
SS: 3:2 M
SE: 2.09 M “If APC gives their ticket to the SW, PDP will LOSE if it gives its ticket to any zone with a lower voting strength. Politics is a game of numbers, not sentiments!”  Copyright PUNCH.
