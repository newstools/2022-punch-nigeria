A stand-up comedian, Maurice Imadu, aka MC Morris, has said he barred singer, Habeeb Okikiola, popularly known as Portable, from performing at his upcoming show slated for May 22 in Ontario, Canada, due to his indiscipline and self-centredness. He told Sunday Scoop, “I removed Portable from my Canada show because of his indiscipline and self-centredness. I came in contact with him through his former manager, Yusuf Adepitan (Ijoba Danku), and I proposed my Canada show which was welcomed and we started the process with an agreed fee. I spoke with Portable twice on the phone and when I found out that he could not hold a conversation, I concentrated on talking with his manager. After the deal was agreed upon, an invite was sent to the embassy and it was approved, after which they were told to come for their biometric (capturing) and passport submission. I was at peace that it had been settled until I woke up about a week ago and saw a video online where Portable claimed that he had sacked his manager, promoter and DJ. The promoter is the one championing the Canada show, so how do you sack him and still want me to go ahead with you on the show? That would amount to a betrayal. Hence, I had to drop him. Interestingly, he was not the headliner for the event as it will feature other entertainers such as Dr Fresh, Azadus, Aki and Pawpaw, Lola Alao and Saco. “Portable will soon understand the absence of people in his life and it would have been too late by the time he realizes. He would have to learn the hard way.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
