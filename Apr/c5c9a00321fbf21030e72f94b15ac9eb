All Presidential aspirants from various political parties will converge on the State House Conference Centre at 06:30 pm on Saturday, April 23, 2022, for a Ramadan Iftar dinner with the First Lady, Aisha Buhari. In an invitation letter sighted by The PUNCH, the invitees were instructed not to come along with their mobile devices, except for their invitation cards which would serve as their entry pass. However, this directive will not apply to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and governors and ministers who are expected to be at the meeting; The PUNCH learnt. In a phone interview with our correspondent, the spokesperson of the First Lady, Aliyu Abdullahi, who confirmed the meeting said, “There is nothing here. This is a standard operational protocol in the Villa when you are having a meeting with either of the three occupants of the Presidency. I “f they are coming for an event, this is supposed to be DSS enforced when the president is having an event or the Vice President is having an event or the first lady is having an event. Because outsiders will come. That’s the security and standard protocol. “That does not apply to the Vice President. How can you expect that to apply to the Vice President or even to ministers?” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
