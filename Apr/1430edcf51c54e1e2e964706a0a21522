A former Commonwealth and WBA Inter-Continental light heavyweight champion, Peter Oboh, has predicted a tough time for Dillian Whyte if the right Tyson Fury shows up for their WBC heavyweight fight on Saturday in England. While admitting that both men are heavy punchers, Oboh noted that Fury, who is defending his title, has proved to be a boxer for the big occasion with two victories over Deontay Wilder, after their first fight ended in a stalemate draw in one of boxing’s greatest trilogy. He said Fury had become fans’ favourite in Nigeria, but warned that a powerful blow from a spirited Whyte could dent the record of the champion, who is yet to taste defeat. “It’s obvious the two boxers are heavy punchers. But if the right Fury shows up on Saturday, Whyte may not last beyond the ninth round. They both have impressive knockout records to their credit but one must go for the other. It’s a massive fight and I’m sure both boxers are up to standard,” Oboh stated. “I mean no disrespect to Whyte because he is a great fighter, but Fury has the capacity to win the fight. However, it will definitely be a tough one, no doubt. The over 90,000 fans expected to be at the fight will get their money’s worth. “Nigerians feels that Fury will overcome Whyte because of his two wins over Wilder. Fury has built up a fan base in Nigeria, but if he is careless, Whyte has the punch to put him away because punches are no respecter of persons,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
