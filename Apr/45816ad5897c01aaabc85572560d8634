Former Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, has emerged as a contender to become the next head coach of the Malian national team one week after the dismissal of former coach Mohamed Magassouba, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Rohr, who part parted ways with Nigeria last December, is being considered for the job alongside former Mali international, Eric Chelle, and Djibril Drame according to a report on Afrique Foot. Magassouba, 64, who has been in charge of the team since 2017, was dismissed with all of his staff after Mali failed to qualify for the Qatar 2022 World Cup despite their strong pool of talents. Mali were beaten 1-0 over two legs by Tunisia in their Qatar 2022 World Cup playoff, after giving away a horrendous own goal in first leg in Bamako. It was the closest Mali had come to a first-ever World Cup finals appearance. Magassouba’s sacking was expected after the Eagles were also eliminated in the round of 16 at the Africa Cup of Nations on penalties by less-fancied Equatorial Guinea in January. Rohr worked in Nigeria for five years, leading the Super Eagles to a third-place finish at the 2019 AFCON and getting eliminated at the group stage of the World Cup in 2018. The former Bordeaux manager had been linked with the Malian job in the past but said he chose Nigeria at the time. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
