The Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress on Thursday rescinded its decision not to take part in the forthcoming local government election in the state, noting that it was now fully prepared to battle the Peoples Democratic Party. Addressing a press conference at the end of the party’s meeting at its Secretariat in Benin, the State Publicity Secretary of the party, Peter Uwadiae, explained that the decision of the party was in line with the directives of its national leadership, which approved the party’s participation in the election. He said, “The Edo State APC emerged from an emergency meeting. Before now, we had said we will not participate in the elections. But the national leadership of our party has decided that we should participate despite our misgivings such as budgetary provisions for the exercise, among other issues. “We are already prepared and ready to go into the election headlong. We had said before that anytime the PDP government in the state is ready to conduct free fair and credible elections in the local governments, we are ready to present our best. This is still our position.” “We are using this opportunity to call on all our members across the state from the wards to the local governments to brace up and liaise with their respective executive committees on how they will present themselves as candidates for councillorship or council chairman,” Uwadiae added.
