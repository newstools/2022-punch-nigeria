Outgoing Gombe State Commandant of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Samson Wabulari, has disclosed how crude oil bunkering was reduced to the barest minimum in the Niger Delta. Wabulari stated this on Thursday, in an interview with journalists shortly after a valedictory ceremony organised by officers of the command in his honour. He revealed that the government lost revenue to the activities of perpetrators of the illegal venture, adding that through his vigilance while in charge in the area, it was reduced. According to the outgoing State Commandant, NSCDC has shown exemplary patronage to the country, stressing that it has helped to entrench peace aside protecting economic prosperity. Wabulari said, “What I have enjoyed most about the NSCDC is the aspect of bringing peace to this nation. Also, in the area of protecting government assets and Infrastructure. “I recall when I worked in Rivers State, we really reduced bunkering in that area. It was one of the major things we achieved at the time. Bunkering was reduced to the barest minimum from 2007- 2012.” Speaking on the impact of the corps efforts, Wabulari continued, “The leakages were blocked and the revenue by the Federal Government was utilised for the purpose of development of infrastructure because we stopped the money going into illegal hands.” He advised the officers of the command to support their new boss, while urging his successor to serve diligently. “Wherever you find yourself in this country, serve your nation well in whatever capacity. To the incoming Commandant, let him serve his command well. When you serve your nation well, you will achieve a lot,” Wabulari added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
