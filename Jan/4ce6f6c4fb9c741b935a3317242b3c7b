The official unveiling of Nigeria international Samuel Kalu by English Premier League strugglers Watford has been delayed due to the player’s inability to get a work permit, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The winger completed a three-and-a-half-year deal worth €4m from Bordeaux to the Premier League side last week but is yet to get a work permit, which would authorize him to play in England. However, according to L’Equipe, the club has filed for an exemption for the Nigerian. “An exemption request has had to be made as Kalu does not have the necessary playing time to reach the 15-point total to play in the Premier League. “The move has not been put at risk by Claudio Ranieri’s sacking Monday, as the club currently lie in 19th in the league. Les Girondins are set to receive up to €4m in transfer fees depending on the number of appearances the forward makes.” Kalu joined Bordeaux from Belgian side Gent in 2018. He scored 10 goals and provided eight assists in all competitions for the French side in 86 appearances. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
