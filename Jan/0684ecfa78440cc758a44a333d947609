The Lagos State Head of Service, Mr Hakeem Muri-Okunola, has urged public workers to work harder in the New Year in order to collectively build the state. Muri-Okunola said this on Tuesday in his address at a thanksgiving event for public servants held virtually. He said, “I wish to commend your efforts and commitment in the past years and there is no doubt that the quality of the Lagos State Government public service is second to none which explains why citizens and businesses alike in Lagos State look expectantly to the government. “In order for the state government to reinvent a more sustainable future, accelerate socio-economic development, improve the health care delivery system and all its value chains – including supply chains, primary health care and alternative medicine – and implement policies that would facilitate a more sustainable environment in which to live and work, I urge you all to work harder this year at building the Lagos of our collective dreams.” The HoS also encouraged public servants to comply with existing COVID-19 safety protocols. “I want public servants to continue to exhibit the time-tested values, ethos and traditions of honesty, probity, transparency, integrity, hard work and service excellence that are all the hallmarks of the Lagos State public service, and I wish to remind all workers that COVID-19 pandemic is still ravaging the world, therefore, always comply with existing safety protocols as laid down by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Lagos State Ministry of Health,” he added. The Permanent Secretary, Office of the Head of Service, Mr Samson Ajibade, also said the first work day of the year was a great opportunity to pray and appreciate God. Copyright PUNCH.
