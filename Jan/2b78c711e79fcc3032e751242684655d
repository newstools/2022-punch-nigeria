The Director, Defence Information, Major General Jimmy Akpor, has called on the media to help sustain the current morale of troops deployed to various operations across the country. Akpor said this would enable the troops to effectively defend the territorial integrity of the country as well as win the ongoing war against insurgency in Nigeria. He also stated that this would be the modest contribution of the press to national security. Akpor spoke after assuming office on Friday at the Defence Headquarters in Abuja. He said, “Bearing in mind that national security encompasses the ability of our nation to protect its citizens, economy and other institutions, the military, with other security agencies, have been in the forefront of maintaining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the nation as well as facilitating economic, political and energy security, amongst other aspects of national security. “Permit me to bore you with one of the components of fighting power, the morale component, which enables personnel to fight efficiently, braving all difficulties while carrying out their constitutional roles. The press, our press, must therefore do its own part (as you have always done), in sustaining the morale of the citizenry and especially the morale of the military, along with other security agencies, as it deals with the contemporary security challenges that bedevil the nation. “Fostering the morale of the fighting troops, the morale of the military, would remain your critical contribution to national security as members of the press.”  Copyright PUNCH.
