Veteran actress and preacher, Eucharia Anunobi, on Saturday told her fans that their social media posts can reveal who they were. She made this known in a video on her Instagram page, where she admonished her followers to be careful of what they post on social media. The preacher, who goes by the title ‘Apostle’, described social media as a Curriculum Vitae through which people get jobs online. She said, “When are you going to wake up and realise that your social media platform in this clime is the curriculum vitae, through which people can see how stupid or how smart you are? And also a determinant of the jobs to give you or functions to invite you to. So when are you going to wake up to realise that, you fool?” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
