Bandits who abducted the wife and two daughters of a lecturer at the Federal College of Education (Technical) Gusau, Zamfara State, Dr Muazu Abdurrazak, have demanded the sum of N50m as ransom. A family member of the victims, Mohammed Jamilu, told PUNCH Metro that the bandits informed them that they needed the sum of N100m, which was later reduced to N50m. Jamilu, however, said negotiation was ongoing, adding that the demand was outrageous. “Where can we get that amount? It is too much for us. We are still negotiating with the bandits in order to rescue the three victims, who are all females,” he added. The lecturer’s wife, Binta, and the two daughters, Maryam and Hafsat, were kidnapped at their house in Mareri village on the outskirts of Gusau town, around 1am on Friday. A worker at the institution, Mohammad Lawal, said the gunmen planned to abduct Muazu, adding that the lecturer hid in the ceiling when he heard their movements. Lawal said, “The gunmen jumped over the wall and entered into his house in order to kidnap him, but he escaped through the ceiling. “They searched the house for over one hour looking for him, but when they could not see him, they abducted his wife, Binta, and his two daughters, Maryam and Hafsat.” The spokesperson for the state police command, SP Mohammed Shehu, confirmed the incident. He said, “The command has since drafted its tactical operatives to pursue the bandits in order to rescue the victims.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
