The Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji, has passed away. He was 93 years old. His death was confirmed by palace sources on Sunday. “It is what you have heard. Baba (Olubadan) has joined his ancestors,” one of the palace sources said. Confirming the Olubadan’s death, Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, said, “The news of the death of our father, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Saliu Adetunji, Aje Ogungunniso I, came as a shock. “His wealth of experience, his immense wisdom, and his commitment to seeing a greater Ibadan and a better Oyo State are unrivalled. “Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria and humanity at large will miss Kabiyesi, who was ever ready to give his all to see a better society.” The Olubadan died 22 days after the death of another prominent monarch in Oyo State – Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Jimoh Oyewumi. Adetunji, who was crowned the 41st Olubadan on March 4, 2016, was born on August 26, 1928 to the family of Raji Olayiwola and Suwebat Amope Adetunji in the Alusekere compound, Popoyemoja, Ibadan. Adetunji was crowned Olubadan after the demise of Oba Samuel Odulana Odugade. He was the first of 17 children of his parents. He grew up learning vocational jobs until he took up fashion designing as a means of living after moving into Lagos. While working as a fashion designer, Adetunji delved into musical record marketing until 1960 when he founded his first of three record label imprints called Baba Laje Records which housed notable fuji music acts, including Dauda Epo-Akara and Wasiu Ayinde Marshall. Prior to his coronation as the Olubadan of Ibadan, Adetunji was the Balogun of Ibadan land. Details later… Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
