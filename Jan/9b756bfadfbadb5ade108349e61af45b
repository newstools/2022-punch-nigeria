About 1,500,000 tablets and capsules of pharmaceutical opioids, including tramadol, exol-5 and diazepam have been intercepted in Edo State by operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency. They were said to have been loaded in Onitsha, Anambra State, and heading for Yauri, Kebbi State, before they were intercepted on Friday, January 14, same day 425,000 diazepam tablets were recovered at Segemu, Kano. The NDLEA Director of Media and Advocacy, Femi Babafemi, stated these in a statement on Sunday. According to him, while about N1,413,344 was also seized along with arms and ammunition from a suspected bandit and a drug kingpin in Plateau State, over 137.754 kilogrammes of assorted illicit drugs were recovered during operations across seven states in the past week. He said, “Acting on credible intelligence, operatives in Edo State on Friday, January 14, 2022, intercepted a trailer coming from Onitsha and going to Yauri in Kebbi State. A thorough search of the truck led to the discovery of psychotropic substances concealed under legitimate goods. “The drugs seized include 394,480 capsules and 3,000 tablets of tramadol, weighing 83.707kg; exol-5: 647,500 tablets, weighing 203.315kg; diazepam: 12,500 tablets, weighing 2.05kg; bromazepam: 1,500 tablets, weighing 0.45kg; codeine-based syrup: 999 bottles, weighing 134.865kg; pentazocine injections: 4,000 ampoules, weighing 16.64kg. “The driver of the truck, Bashir Lawali, 30, was arrested along with Abubakar Sani, 30, and Ali Abubakar, 19, while the exhibits in Kano were seized from one Sa’idu Yahya, 31. “Attempts by drug traffickers to export 73 parcels of cannabis (34.05kg) concealed in foodstuff plastic containers to the United Kingdom through the NAHCO export shed of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos, were frustrated by operatives on January 8, same way another 50 parcels of cannabis consignment (27.25kg) meant for the United States was also intercepted at the export shed of the airport on Tuesday, January 11, and at least three suspects so far arrested. “In a reverse bid, moves by illicit drug merchants to bring into Nigeria 94 parcels of cannabis indica (Colorado) weighing 43.4kg through the Tincan seaport in Lagos were crushed on January 13, when operatives intercepted the drug inside a 40-foot container from Canada.” Babafemi said the exhibit was concealed inside a Toyota Camry car, adding that “this came on the heels of a similar seizure on January 11 of 59 parcels of Colorado (17.3kg) concealed in a Mercedes Benz vehicle imported from Canada.” Also in Plateau State, a fake security agent, Babagana Ma’aji, was reportedly arrested through a controlled delivery of 5.6kg cannabis from Lagos.
