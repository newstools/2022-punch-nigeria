Hope PSBank, a subsidiary of Unified Payment Services Limited, has said it is committed to partnering with the Federal Government on job creation to reduce unemployment and alleviate poverty significantly in the country. The Managing Director, Hope PSBank, Mr Ayotunde Kuponiyi, said this during the inauguration of the Extended Special Public Works programme instituted by the Federal Government, and the launch of Hope PSBank Agency POS terminal in Warri, Delta. According to Kuponiyi, the ESPW programme of the Federal Government is in total alignment with the social objective of the bank. He said in a statement that the bank had mapped out an exit strategy for participants such that beneficiaries could render financial services to customers while also earning a living by so doing. “Beneficiaries, armed with vocational skills, are now being empowered as agents of the bank to deliver digital financial services in their respective LGAs, which helps to drive financial inclusion and stimulate economic activities in these LGAs,” he said. He expressed his appreciation to the Federal Government and the National Directorate for Employment for the support and commitment towards the success of the exit strategy for the participants. Kuponiyi disclosed that through the initiative, the bank had so far successfully onboarded over 65,000 participants of the scheme as agents of the bank.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
