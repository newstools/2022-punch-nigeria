Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has said his administration will partner with the Nigerian Institute of Town Planners to enable the state realise it’s urban master plan, aimed at driving sustainable socio-economic growth and development. Obaseki disclosed this when he received the National President of the Nigerian Institute of Town Planners, Mr Olutoyin Ayinde, who led other members of his institute on a courtesy visit at the Government House, Benin City. He said, “We would like you to send a technical team to us; we want to partner with you on our planning project. We don’t want just a visit; we are challenging you to send a team to work with us. “It’s a call to our development. If we don’t do it, we will not be able to go anywhere. I have sent the challenge back to you. We want to stop this whole issue of self-help; we are committed and have the mandate of our people.” Obaseki added, “There are people who have been more fortunate than us, including countries and communities; they have developed farther than us and we can begin to learn from them. “If we are striving to be the best, it will be fair to learn from them. What we will do is work with people who have better technology for them to come and set up and work with our local engineers and train them on key capacity building.” Earlier, Ayinde commended the governor for his leadership qualities, noting the institute’s plan to work with the government in ensuring the realization of the state’s 30-year developmental plan.
