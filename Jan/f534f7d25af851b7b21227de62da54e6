A former Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of FSB International Bank Plc, Alhaji Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, has identified the absence of citizens’ participation in political affairs as one of the factors responsible for the grim state of affairs in Nigeria. Hayatu-Deen spoke on Sunday during an interactive session with leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party, Borno State chapter, in Maiduguri. The former chairman of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group said Nigeria was destined to be a dynamic and globally competitive country but has been plagued by a chronically inefficient allocation of resources and mismanagement. He said the desired change for a better and prosperous country can only happen if citizens’ participation in democratic and political institutions is expanded. The ex-bank chief, who used the occasion to declare his membership of the PDP, said he would give his all and strive to place matters on the economic well-being of the Nigerian people and the burning issues of insecurity at the centre of the party’s platform. He asserted that healing the deep divisions in the country is of paramount importance’s a necessary condition for stability and progress. “I have thought long and hard about the calamity that has befallen our dear country and identified many factors that are responsible for this grim state of affairs. One of them is the glaring absence of citizens’ action and participation in the political affairs of the nation”, he said.
