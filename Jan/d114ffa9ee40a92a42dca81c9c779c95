OPERATIVES of the Lagos Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission have arrested one Bolarinwa Oluwasegun for an alleged N270m fraud. The suspect, who posed as a General in the Nigerian Army, allegedly made false representations to the complainant, Kodef Clearing Resources, that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had shortlisted him and one other to be appointed as the Chief of Army Staff. A statement on Thursday by the EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, titled, ‘EFCC arrests fake General who claimed Buhari nominated him as COAS for alleged N270m fraud,’ further said Oluwasegun claimed he needed a grant to “press and process the appointment.” He also allegedly forged a letter of appointment as COAS purportedly signed by the President and showed the same to the victim to further prove his claim. The suspect claimed he needed to pay a certain amount of money into the coffers of the Federal Government as part of the requirements for appointment as COAS. According to the EFCC, Oluwasegun, in his bid to defraud the victim, also allegedly forged several documents and the signature of the President. The statement read, “He was arrested at his house in the Alagbado area of Lagos State on Wednesday, January 12, 2022. “Upon his arrest, six pump action guns, three cartridge bullets, a swagger stick and several forged documents were recovered from him. “The suspect will be charged to court as soon as investigation is concluded.” Copyright PUNCH.
