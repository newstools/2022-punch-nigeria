The Ogun State Government has threatened to sanction owners of private schools in the state that admit any student expelled from public schools. The government also threatened to name and shame any culpable pupils at the school, zonal and state levels where any pupils are found wanting. The state Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Prof.  Abayomi Arigbagbu, stated this on Tuesday at a press briefing held in Abeokuta, the state capital, to unveil the strategies mapped out to tackle juvenile delinquency in schools. Arigbabu said the government would not only announce erring students publicly as a deterrent to others, but will also reward well behaved pupils who have distinguished themselves in academics and character. He said as a responsible government, the state government could not sit down and allow continuous misbehaviour in the state’s public schools. The commissioner ascribed these misbehaviours to bad parenting, social media, peer group, wrong role models, economic situations. Arigbabu said the ministry would be holding series of meetings with security agencies, principals and heads of schools, Parents and Teachers Associations and others, in order to form effective alliance against vices and juvenile delinquencies in schools. He said, “We are taking very serious steps against crimes and criminality in both public and private schools and private school owners should cooperate with us in this fight. We are the one that give licences to the private schools and if any of them flout our directives, we can easily have their licences withdrawn. “There will be naming and shaming of pupils that engage in crimes and juvenile delinquencies in our schools across the state. That will be done at school, zonal and state levels. We are also going to involve our pupils and engage in all sorts of extra-curricular activities to discourage the pupils from juvenile delinquencies. “Students expelled should not be admitted into any public or private school in Ogun State, that is something that will be very difficult and that is why we put in place what we call the learner identification number. “The E- platform we are using now will make it difficult for dual registration. “Once you are in a school and you misbehave and you are sent away, it will be very difficult to get into another school in Ogun but, some of them will want to get into schools, and that is why we are meeting private school owners tomorrow.” Copyright PUNCH.
