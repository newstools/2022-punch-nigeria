The National Agency for Food Drug Administration and Control has uncovered adulterated wheat in Gombe markets. NAFDAC Gombe State Coordinator, James Agada, made this disclosure on Friday, during a media briefing organised by the Ministry of Information and Culture. He said 80 bags of pesticide-treated wheat meant for planting instead of consumption, were being sold by one Adamu Hassan, who allegedly failed to enlighten buyers. According to him, a measure of wheat originally sells for between N600 and N1,000, while the adulterated wheat goes for between N200 and N300 leading to high demand. Agada said, “As part of our routine surveillance and work in the state, we gathered intelligence that chemically- treated wheat meant for farmers has been diverted into the market in Gombe here for sale to consumers at a much reduced rate for their consumption. “We sent our officials to go discreetly to buy this product and they were able to buy it freely without any caution. “The public should desist from the purchase and consumption of this chemically-treated wheat, while we want to appeal to the programme managers of Anchor Borrowers to do more tracing in their monitoring and evaluation. “The chemicals used in treating this is a pesticide and it also has a fungi effect, such that this grain in the soil will resist the attack of fungicides and insects. Something that is dangerous to insects and now someone is ingesting it directly. It will impact on neurological issues, as well as the proliferation of kidney issues.”  Copyright PUNCH.
