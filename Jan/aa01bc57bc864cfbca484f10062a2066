Noble Kids Comprehensive College, the school where suspected kidnappers buried a murdered five-year-old girl, Hanifa Abubakar, has been set ablaze by angry youths in Kano. Confirming the incident on Monday, Police spokesperson in Kano, Abdullahi Kiyawa, said it happened in the middle of the night. He said no casualty was recorded but parts of the school were damaged by the fire. No suspect has been arrested, he added. Hanifa’s remains were seen buried in a shallow grave when policemen visited the school located at Kwanar Dakata in Nassarawa Local Government Area, Kano, on Thursday. She had been abducted on December 2 by the proprietor of the school, Abdulmalik Tanko, who had since been arrested. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
