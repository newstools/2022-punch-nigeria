Super Eagles media officer, Babafemi Raji, has brushed off suggestions that the Super Eagles will be focused on Liverpool talisman Mohammed Salah when Nigeria battle Egypt in their first Group D game at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations on Tuesday. Nigeria, three-time African champions, are pitted alongside the Egyptians  Guinea-Bissau and Sudan in Group D in Garoua. Speaking ahead of the encounter, Raji, who is fully aware of the threat that Salah poses, told Mehwar TV, “We very much respect the Egyptian team and know the capabilities of Mohamed Salah. Our team has great potential and we know how to stop the strengths of the Pharaohs. “We are here to play against the entire Egyptian national team, not just against Mohamed Salah. “It is certain that Nigeria is the first candidate to qualify from its group, and we do not care who will qualify with us, and we respect everyone.” The Eagles will look to improve on their 2019 finish when they finished third in Egypt.
