Afro-pop singer, Simisola Kosoko, popularly known as Simi, has said that motherhood has changed her more than marriage has. Asked what marriage had changed about her, she told Sunday Scoop, “Nothing really. I feel motherhood has changed me more than marriage has because in marriage, it is still the two of us and it is pretty much the same. It is just a change of address.” The mother-of-one also spoke about her experience in 2021 as an entertainer. She said, “It was an interesting year and I did not put out any music until November. It was a great year for afrobeats and I am glad that I was a part of the explosion that has been happening in the industry.” Simi, who gave birth to her first child, Adejare, in 2020, explained what motherhood has taught her. She said, “It has taught me to prioritise and go easy on myself because it is a lot (of work). You have to enjoy the moment that you have, whether in your work or with your child.” On one thing she would like to change about herself if possible, the 33-year-old singer said, “I would be more proactive about the things I want outside of music and to actually push it consistently and be more patient. I want to be a more patient person in 2022.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
