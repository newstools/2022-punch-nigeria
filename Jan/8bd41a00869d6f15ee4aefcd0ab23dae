Commercial activities were again grounded in some major cities in Anambra State such as Nnewi, Onitsha and some parts of Awka on Wednesday, making it the third day of sit-at-home. The situation was despite the statements by the Indigenous People of Biafra that there would not be any sit-at-home on Wednesday and Thursday. On Wednesday, banks, offices, markets, motor parks, schools and major roads were again devoid of any activity. There was, however, no record of violence as many people remained indoor. At a branch of a new generation bank in Onitsha, an official told our correspondent that the bank will not open to customers. It was also observed that the River Niger Bridge was devoid of its usual heavy vehicular movement. A government official, who did not want his name in print, regretted that the government and the people are daily losing revenues as a result of the situation. “This is not palatable at all. They should know that it is the economy of the South East that is at stake here. When you shut markets, offices, banks and motor parks, you know what that means to the pockets of individuals and even the government,” he said. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
