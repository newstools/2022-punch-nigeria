The Executive Chairman of the Ogun State Internal Revenue Services, Mr Olugbenga Olaleye, has said the digitisation of the processes involved in the payment of taxes in the state will reduce revenue leakages to the barest minimum and increase revenue generation in 2022. Olaleye said this in Abeokuta while defending his agency’s budget proposal of over N56bn for the next fiscal year before the state lawmakers, according to a statement. He said OGIRS was also focusing on ensuring that tax agents and taxpayers carry out their civic responsibilities with comfort. Olaleye said the filling processes were on digitisation, which is called Ogun State Electronic Tax Administration Portals for the typical business environment. “The tax auditing monitoring agents do not come to our office, but operate from the comfort of their homes, they could open the portals, see the audits allocated to them, as the reports are coming in, they download into the system and review, these are areas done manually in the past where there were leakages,” he said. He expressed confidence that the 2022 revenue figure would be delivered as presented, especially with the right infrastructure received on time from the state government. While appreciating the government for operational vehicles received in the year 2021, he solicited the provision of more buses that would enhance revenue enforcement drive in the year 2022.
