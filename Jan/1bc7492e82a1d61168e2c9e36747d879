The Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, through the Nigerian Stored Products Research Institute, has distributed agricultural storage items worth millions of naira to farmers in Akwa Ibom State. Speaking on Thursday during the distribution of the items in Uyo, Akwa Ibom, the Executive Director of the institute, Dr Patricia Pessu, said the gesture was aimed at ensuring a reduction in harvest losses through storage. Pessu, who was represented by the institute’s Zonal Coordinator, Port Harcourt Zonal Office, Dr Idorenyin Nwaehujor, urged beneficiaries to ensure proper use of the items to encourage the Federal Government to do more. She said the storage facilities distributed would help farmers to store their agricultural products and export for value addition. According to her, the storage facilities, such as hermetic drum, have the capacity to preserve grains and dried products for over three years. Pessu said, “Our mandate is to carry out research into storage facilities, and you will agree with me that the main problem of agriculture sector is storage. The farmers are very hardworking in planting and what happened after harvest is the issue. The Commissioner for Agriculture, Dr Glory Edet, thanked the Federal Government and the NSPRI for ensuring that the storage facilities were sent to farmers in Akwa Ibom. The State Director, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr Uyobong Uko, said the storage facilities would discourage the use of chemicals, which he described dangerous to the body.
