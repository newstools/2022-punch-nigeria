Super Eagles assistant coach, Joseph Yobo, gave his assessment of Nigeria’s other Group G opponents Sudan and Guinea Bissau after watching both sides play a goalless draw on Tuesday. Ahead of the crucial tie against the Sudanese on Saturday, the former Nigeria captain stated that the Falcons of Jediane and Guinea-Bissau had similar playing styles. The three-time African champions will square off against the1970 champions on Saturday, knowing a win will seal their place in the knockout rounds. The Sudanese have relatively unknown players with most of their players plying their trades in the Sudan Premier League. Their only player, who plies his trade outside Sudan is Athar El Tahir, who plays for Egyptian side Smouha. To battle a side he knows little about, interim boss Austin Eguavoen sent his coaching crew to study the opponents. Yobo, who captained the Eagles to AFCON victory in 2013, refused to give out much about the opposition but said they had a similar way of playing. “They are a good team, both teams that played-Sudan and Guinea-Bissau, they are kind of similar in the way they play and set up,” Yobo told Brila Sports TV. “The scouting was just a basis to see how they set up.” On his influence on the Eagles players, he said, “I am one of those that like to share ideas, opinions and also interact and give them what I feel based on my own experience. “These are top players and it is just to remind them we are here for this tournament, we want to win every game, we want to give our best.”.
