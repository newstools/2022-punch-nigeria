The Chairman of the Technical Committee for the Actualisation of Atiku Abubakar Presidential Election, Chief Raymond Dokpesi, on Thursday, asked the Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, to return the secretariat of the Peoples Democratic Party since he had defected to the All Progressives Congress. The PUNCH reports that the PDP office has been under lock and key since Umahi joined the APC, which forced the PDP to relocate to a hotel as its temporal office. Dokpesi gave the directive during his consultation for Atiku’s presidential ambition with PDP stakeholders in Ebonyi State, on Thursday. Dokpesi also asked the governor to immediately release the Publicity Secretary of the party, Nwoba Nwoba, who has been remanded in police custody. He said, “I remember vividly when I came here on two, three occasions, the first one was when I was contesting for chairman of the party, this governor met me at Abuja to plead with me to step down for the chairmanship race in the overall interest of the party and the Federal Government. “I call on him to, at this point, to return the secretariat to the PDP. Let me also call on him to immediately release the PDP spokesman whom he has taken to court with trump up charges. “We are all supposed to be democratic. People have a right to different opinions. I want to call on all members of the Peoples Democratic Party in this place to remain resilient. I believe very shortly you will be hearing some good news.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
