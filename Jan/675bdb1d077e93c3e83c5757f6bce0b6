The Lagos State Government has unveiled its plan to rescue over two million out-of-school children in the state through the Eko Excel programme. The Executive Chairman of Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board, Mr Wahab Alawiye-King, said this in a statement on Wednesday. He said, “It cannot be overemphasised that over nine million out-of-school children need protection from the daily violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation and exclusion they face. “Lagos State has over two million out-of-school children and this is a problem that the government wanted to tackle with the introduction of the Eko Excel programme. “Since the commencement of the programme, it has taken many out-of-school children off the streets into classrooms, as well as protecting out-of-school children from daily violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation and exclusion they face.” A member of LASUBEB, Mr Adebayo Adefuye, said the government was making public schools more conducive for learning to improve child enrollment. “We are making public schools a fun, friendly environment for learning and I am certain we will see more improvements in our enrollment figures. “Furthermore, Eko Excel schools are monitored real-time by a digital and data-driven electronic dashboard that displays the data of all 1009 primary schools under the programme, 13,673 teachers, 10,085 classrooms and almost 500,000 pupils across all the local government areas in Lagos State,” he said.
