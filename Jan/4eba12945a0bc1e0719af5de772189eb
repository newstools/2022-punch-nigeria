Former Senate President and former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, has mourned a former presidential candidate of the defunct National Republican Convention in the aborted 1993 third republic, Alhaji Bashir Tofa. Tofa was announced dead on Monday at the age of 74. Reacting, Anyim, in a statement signed by his Media Adviser, Sam Nwaobasi, said he received with deep sorrow, news of the death of the elder statesman and veteran politician. According to the statement, “Sen. Anyim notes that the Late Alhaji Bashir Tofa was a committed Nigerian who throughout his more than 40 years of active partisan politics demonstrated his strong belief in politics of accommodation and consensus-building. He was so committed to a peaceful Nigeria that throughout the electioneering campaigns leading to the 1993 presidential elections, in which he was the candidate of the National Republican Convention (NRC), Alhaji Tofa never did anything, in words or actions, that could have instigated crisis in any form. “Sen. Anyim commends Alhaji Tofa’s “politics without bitterness” and strongly recommends such disposition to politicians of today in the interest of the peace, unity and harmony of our dear country even as we approach the 2023 general elections. “Sen Anyim regrets that Alhaji Tofa died when his experience and elderly counsel would be most needed as the country battles with multiple challenges. “Sen. Anyim deeply condoles with the late Alhaji Tofa’s family, the good people of Kano State and Alhaji Tofa’s many friends and associates all over Nigeria. He prays that Almighty God will grant the Soul of Alhaji Tofa eternal rest.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
