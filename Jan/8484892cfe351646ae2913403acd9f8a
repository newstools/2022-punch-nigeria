Kingmakers have elected Lawrence Adebajo as the Orimolusi-elect of Ijebu-Igbo in Ijebu North Local Government Area of Ogun State, after 27 years’ battle to fill the vacant first class stool. Our correspondent gathered that the last Orimolusi, Oba Sani Adetayo, died in May 1994 and since then, the seat had been vacant due to a dispute over who would succeed him. It was further learnt that nine contestants from Ojuronmi Ruling House, whose turn it is to produce the next king, engaged in a disagreement which stalled the process. But the protracted crisis ended on Tuesday when the community’s kingmakers elected Adebajo. It was learnt that Adebajo polled six votes to defeat Saliu Sadiku who had four votes. The state government confirmed the development on Wednesday. It said 10 out of the 11 warrant chiefs appointed by the state government voted in the election that produced the Orimolusi-elect. The state Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Afolabi Afuape, disclosed this while answering questions from journalists shortly after presenting certificate and staff of office to the Alale of Moriwi, Oba Olusegun Taiwo, in Imeko/Afon Local Government Area of Ogun State. Afuape said, “An Oba-elect has emerged as Orimolusi of Ijebu-Igbo,” but added that he has not received details of the process that led to the emergence. He said “The information got to me yesterday (Tuesday) at the election. The chiefs voted yesterday and I think Oba-elect actually emerged. “When I get to the office, I will get more details. But for now, there is an Oba-elect.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
