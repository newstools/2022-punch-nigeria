Ex-Super Eagles goalkeeper Uche Akubuike has passed a vote of confidence on the four keepers in the national team at the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. The AFCON is scheduled to kick off on Sunday, with the Eagles playing their first game of the competition against eight-time champions Egypt at the Roumdé Adjia Stadium, Garoua. With the expansion of the squad from 23 to 28 to cater for teams who may possibly loss players to the COVID-19 pandemic, Eagles interim coach, Austin Eguavoen, extended call-ups to four keepers – Sparta Rotterdam’s Maduka Okoye, Kaizer Chiefs’ Daniel Akpeyi, Omonia Nicosia’s Francis Uzoho and John Noble of Enyimba. Akubuike, who narrowly missed out on representing the Eagles at the 1998 World Cup in France, believes that the current goalies are among the best in Africa. “Our goalkeepers are some of the best in Africa and from the clubs they play for, you can tell how good they are,” Akubuike told PUNCH Sports Extra. “I believe they are going to do very well at the AFCON and I can confidently say that Maduka will be exceptional. Uzoho and Akpeyi need to work on their confidence and for Noble, I love that they are taking him to the competition for encouragement and I believe it will make him better.”  Copyright PUNCH.
