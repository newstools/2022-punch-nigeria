Troops have killed three terrorists along the Tele-Sabon Gida road in the Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State. The Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, who disclosed this on Saturday, said the military authorities informed the state government about the incident. Aruwan said during the operation, the troops recovered three AK-47s, three AK-47 magazines, two motorcycles and two mobile phones. He said, “Military authorities have reported to the Kaduna State Government that troops neutralised three terrorists during patrols along the Telele-Sabon Gida road in the Chikun LGA. According to the operational feedback, the troops laid an ambush at a suspected terrorists’ rallying point on the route. “As expected, the outlaws approached the troops’ position, and entered the killing range, after which they were vigorously engaged. The criminals returned fire but were overpowered by the troops after a brief firefight. Three terrorists were neutralised in the exchange. The commissioner quoted Governor Nasir El-Rufai as expressing satisfaction over the operation that led to the killing of the terrorists in the state. “Governor Nasir El-Rufa’i expressed satisfaction at the operational feedback. He commended the troops for their swift and decisive action in engaging the terrorists and encouraged them to keep up the tempo against criminal elements. Security forces are sustaining patrols and monitoring of the general area,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
