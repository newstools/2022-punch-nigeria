About five days after his abduction, the Bayelsa State Commissioner for Industry, Trade and Investment, Federal Otokito, is still held hostage in the kidnappers’ den. The gunmen, suspected to be operators of illegal crude oil refinery also known as kpofire,’’ are insisting that they will not release the commissioner until the detained father of their camp leader is freed by the police. Otokito was kidnapped on Thursday from his residence at Otuokpoti community in the Ogbia Local Government Area of the state. The camp leader had on Saturday morning contacted the paramount ruler of the community and informed him that the commissioner was in their custody. He gave the community chief the condition that unless his detained father was freed by the police, they would not release the victim. The PUNCH gathered on Sunday that 24 hours after contacting the paramount ruler of the community, the gang leader had also called the Community Development Committee chairman to reiterate what he told the traditional ruler. A family source, who spoke in confidence, said the camp leader contacted the CDC chairman on Sunday morning. The source said, “There is no sign for now that they will release the commissioner soon. He (the gang leader) made another call this (Sunday) morning to the CDC chairman and told him what they had told the paramount ruler on Saturday. He is not asking for ransom. “But he restated the condition he has placed, that until his detained father is released by the police they will not free the commissioner.” When contacted, the spokesman for the state police command, Asinim Butswat, said “there is no new development on the incident.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
