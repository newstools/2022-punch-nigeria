The Federal Government through the Universal Basic Education Commission has secured a grant of $98m from the  Islamic Development Bank, Saturday PUNCH has learnt. Our correspondent gathered that the grant would be utilised towards building nine bi-lingual schools. Though the Federal Government and the bank failed to disclose the details of the languages involved, our correspondent learnt that the projects would be facilitated in three states namely Borno, Adamawa and Gombe states with three bi-lingual schools built in each of the states. Three different  memos with reference numbers FGN/ISDB/BEP/CW/AD/Lot1-3; FGN/ISDB/BEP/CW/BN/Lot1-3 and FGN/ISDB/BEP/CW/Lot1-3 on the project partly read, “The Federal Government of Nigeria has received financing for the amount of $98m from the Islamic Development Bank towards the cost of the Bilingual Education Project, and intends to apply part of the proceeds towards payment under the contracts for civil works (construction of three units each) of bi-lingual education boarding schools in Borno, Adamawa and Gombe.” In Gombe, the schools will be located in Garin Hamza, Yamaltu-Deba Local government area of Gombe, Dogun-ruwa Awak district in Kaltungo LGA  and Shamaki Wada-gombe LGA. In Borno, the proposed locations are as follows: Bolori district, Maiduguri, Biu, Bayo LGA and Munguno, Borno State, while Mubi South LGA, Ganye LGA and Yola South LGA are the proposed LGAs for Adamawa schools.
