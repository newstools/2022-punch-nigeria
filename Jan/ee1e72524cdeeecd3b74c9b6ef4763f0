The Kano metropolis roared back to life on Thursday following the resumption of commercial tricycle operators, who deserted the streets for three days to protest the imposition of N8,000 renewal operating permit fee on them by the state government. Following the suspension of the three-day old strike on Wednesday, the tricycle operators resumed operations in their large numbers on Thursday morning, conveying commuters to their different destinations. Commuters, on the other hand, heaved a sigh of relief, as their plight of having to trek long distances to their destination had finally come to an end, but they urged the state government to urgently address the dispute to avert another strike. The Chairman, Tricycle Operators Association, Sani Dankili, said the body suspended the strike following the acceptance by the state government to halt the enforcement of the operating renewal permit until after the next meeting scheduled to hold on January 18, 2022 to thrash out areas of conflict. According to him, members of the association are expecting a downward review of the renewal charge as both parties have yet to reach a compromise for an amicable resolution of the dispute. Meanwhile, small and large scale business enterprises, which earlier shut down following the tricycle operators’ strike, have reopened for operations. Similarly, primary and secondary school students returned to school as the tricycle operators were available to drop them at their respective schools. All major streets in the metropolis became congested as commercial tricycles, the major means of transportation within the city, were seen meandering the streets and conveying commuters to different destinations.
