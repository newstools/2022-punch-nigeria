Members of the National Assembly are considering overriding the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill. Chairman of the Senate Committee on Independent National Electoral Commission, Senator Kabiru Gaya, made this known on Monday. Gaya, a former Governor of Kano State, had appeared on Politics Today, a current affairs programme on Channels Television monitored by our correspondent from Abuja on Monday. Buhari had vetoed the electoral bill over the restriction of political parties to direct primary, insisting on the direct, indirect and consensus options. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives had suspended action on the bill till resumption on January 18, 2022. Speaking on Monday, Gaya partly said, “Certainly, by God’s grace, we are resuming tomorrow in plenary and definitely the matter would be brought up on the floor. The Senate President would now be required to refer the letter from Mr President to the committee. Asked if overriding Buhari’s veto was under consideration, Gaya said, “It is under consideration. If we get to the floor (it is) either we veto or we agree on his suggestion: these are the only two options that we have.” “There is a joint committee – both the House and the Senate; the conference committee that worked on it and that was what we passed to the President. He will refer it to us again, we will look at it and we will advise the National Assembly – both the Senate and the House – so that they can now decide on what to do,” he added.  Copyright PUNCH.
