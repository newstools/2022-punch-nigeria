The Chairman of the Social Democratic Party in Benue State, John Enemary, has called on the former National Chairman of the party, Chief Olu Falae, to intervene in the crisis rocking the party. Speaking to journalists in Makurdi on Tuesday, Enemary explained that the party at the national level was embroiled in an intra-party crisis that has given rise to three factional chairmen. According to him, “The intra-party crisis rocking our great party, the SDP calls for urgent attention and I appeal to our father, the former national chairman of the party and elder statesman, Chief Olu Falae to intervene before the party goes into extinction. “Already, there are three factional chairmen of the party; we have one faction that belongs to Supo Shonibare, another faction for Agunloye and also Abdul Ishaq faction.” Enemary said that the party in the state also needed intervention but added that the desired progress of the state rests solely on the party. According to him, “The only visible development in the state was done by the SDP-led government under Moses Adasu and since then, the state has remained stagnant. The party chairman, however, called on the state government to honour the late Rev. Fr. Moses Adasu by naming the Benue State University, Makurdi, established during his administration after him.
