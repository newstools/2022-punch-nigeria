The Coordinator, Akwa Ibom State Steering Committee of the Tinubu Support Group, Mr Ifiok Inyang, on Sunday recalled the contributions of presidential hopeful, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, to the restoration of Nigerian democracy and called on the citizens to support his aspiration. He claimed that the two-term governor of Lagos State risked his life when he joined forces with compatriots in the National Democratic Coalition to chase out the military and restore democracy. Inyang, who was speaking on why Nigerians should support Tinubu’s ambition in an interaction with newsmen in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, lauded Tinubu’s wisdom and maturity in handling the crisis that followed the creation of the development areas in Lagos State, by resorting to court for arbitration. “Bola Ahmed Tinubu, you might recall risked his life when he joined forces with fellow compatriots in NADECO to chase the military from our national political life and install democracy. “As Governor of Lagos State (1999-2007), he created additional Development Areas Councils to elasticize the frontiers of development in Lagos State. This did not go down well with Obasanjo’s presidency. “Thus, that government at the centre withheld against every minuscule of federalist intelligence and patriotic wisdom, constitutionally guaranteed allocation meant for local governments in Lagos State. “That happened against the background that both Obasanjo and Tinubu share a common ancestry; being a democrat as he is, took the matter to court and won the case,” he noted.
