A faction of the All Progressives Congress in Osun State backed by a former governor of the state, Rauf Aregbesola, on Monday challenged Governor Adegboyega Oyetola’s administration to substantiate its claim that some people were out to embark on smear campaign against the governor and his government. The group, in a statement by its Publicity Secretary, Biodun Agboola, said the smear campaign allegation was unfounded, saying the administration is being hunted by its shadow. The PUNCH had reported that the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan, had raised the alarm, saying some people were out to smear Oyetola’s reputation and achievements recorded by his administration. But the factional APC in its statement, said, “The case of The Osun Masterminds group is just the latest of such groups, faceless individuals and members of the cabinet that have been assigned to attack and blackmail the former governor, Rauf Aregbesola. “Virtually, every programme that earned our party accolades and made it an unbeatable one has been denigrated and diminished by the governor. “He has watched with pleasure how known members of his cabinet have used the social and mainstream media to cause disaffection among party members. “How then can such a governor come out now to allege any plot against his administration?” Copyright PUNCH.
