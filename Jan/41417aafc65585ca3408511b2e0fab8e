Ex-Interim National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Bisi Akande, has presented a horse to Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola. The presentation of the horse took place in Akande’s Ila country home, during a tour of Ila Local Government Area by the governor and his team. The presentation, which was witnessed by the deputy governor, Benedict Alabi, wife of the governor, Kafayat Oyetola, ex-deputy governor, Senator Iyiola Omisore, Senator Basiru Ajibola, representing Osun Central in the Senate, among others, elicited excitement as Oyetola expressed appreciation for the gift. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Ismail Omipidan, on Friday said Oyetola had after his strategic engagement tour of Ila Federal Constituency, visited Akande at his residence in Ila. The statement further partly reads, “The tour is a state-wide consultation to the nine federal constituencies in Osun which the governor is using to fraternise with the newly-elected APC executives at the wards and local government levels and to inform them and party members of his intention to participate in the party’s forthcoming primaries in preparation for the July governorship election. “The presentation of the horse to the governor by ‘Baba Omo kekeke’ as Chief Akande is fondly called, is highly symbolic and seen as a declaration of an unalloyed support for the person and candidature of Oyetola. “Horse, political pundits say, symbolises strength, power, freedom, triumph, heroism, nobleness, stamina, tireless, confidence and intelligence. In fact, they say it is a precious gift of life and highly celebrated animal. “Although, it is used for different purposes, what is constant, according to political pundits, is that it is used as a ride to celebrate good things.” While accepting the gift, Oyetola, who was obviously surprised and excited with smiles on his face, said, “Thank you very much.”  Copyright PUNCH.
