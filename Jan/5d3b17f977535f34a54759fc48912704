Tottenham are in talks to sign Arsenal defender Viktoria Schnaderbeck on loan. Arsenal have made the Austria international available for transfer after signing two defenders this window. Tottenham are also continuing talks over a deal for Porto winger Luis Diaz as they look to strengthen their squad before the transfer deadline. Spurs are not expected to attempt an intervention in Adama Traore’s ongoing move to Barcelona and they have other targets – high among them being Diaz. Spurs had wanted Traore to be willing to play at right wing-back for the rest of this season before looking again at the position in the summer market. They remain interested in a deal for Middlesbrough’s Djed Spence this month for example, but he cannot arrive until the summer because he has already played for two clubs this term, currently being on loan at Nottingham Forest. Spurs are hoping to bring in at least one new signing this month regardless of whether they offload Dele Alli, Tanguy Ndombele and/ or Giovani Lo Celso, although doing so could allow them to do more work to the squad.
