The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has commended the Super Eagles of Nigeria for keeping hope alive in the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon by winning all their group matches and advancing to the second round of the tournament in grand style. Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, disclosed this in a statement he signed late Wednesday minutes after the Super Eagles clinched their victory over Guinea Bissau. According to the statement titled ‘AFCON: President Buhari hails emphatic progress of Super Eagles,’ the President urged the Austin Eguavoen-led team to maintain and even surpass the terrific form that made them leaders in the group stage, as Nigeria hopefully looks forward to a total of seven emphatic wins in the competition. “President Buhari trusts that the positive reputation of good sportsmanship the travelling fans, sportswriters and the football team have demonstrated in Cameroon will continue to enliven the importance of sports, particularly football, as an enabler of development, peace, tolerance, friendship and cooperation,” it read. Buhari, therefore, wished the Super Eagles the very best, pledging that his regime would continue to support the efforts of international, regional and national football organisations to use the sport as a tool to build a better and peaceful world.
