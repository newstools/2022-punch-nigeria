The Lagos State AIDS Control Agency has urged market women and men to go for HIV screening in order to know their status. The chief executive officer of the Agency, Dr Mosurate Adeleke, at the flag-off of HIV testing service for market men and women on Tuesday said the state government had granted us approval to include the entire society in the HIV response. The event was held at the office of the President-General Association of Commodity Market Women and Men of Nigeria, Mrs Folashade Tinubu-Ojo. “We realise that the market is a vital community and we have decided to come here to meet the 20 LGAs and 57 LCDA market leaders, and speak to them about what HIV is. When we finish here, we are going to do massive screening in all the markets in LGs and LCDAs. “Another thing we want to achieve is the reduction of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The coverage is very poor; it is about 37 per cent in the country. We are targeting the market men and women because if they know the significance of knowing their HIV status there will be no reason why pregnant women will not know their status. There will be no reason why we will have newborn children coming out to be HIV positive. “The Iyaloja has to tell the market women and men why it is important to know their HIV status. They are a very integral part of society; they contribute to our GDP. We are also going to give them sterilising units through the Iyaloja,” Adeleke said. Responding, Tinubu-Ojo, said, “It is pertinent for all of us to go and know our HIV status. I want to urge all the traders in the state to make good use of this opportunity and do the needful whenever they realise the agency is within their community.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
