The 2021 Christmas celebration was indeed one to remember, as Nigeria’s leading dairy brand, Peak Milk, delighted its consumers across the country with amazing gifts and shopping vouchers in the ‘Share Love, Share Nourishment’ campaign. The campaign, which ran from December 9th to 30th, featured various unique activities. Peak Milk consumers were required to simply share love with their friends and family through gifts and acts of kindness or just by simply being there through tough times. They were required to share pictures of themselves and the recipients of their shared love, caption the activity and discuss the kind of love shared. Post-campaign, over 20 lucky winners were randomly selected and rewarded with Peak Milk (nourishment) in a box plus N20,000 shopping vouchers each. The #Peakmas ‘Share Love, Share Nourishment’ train also visited major markets across the country, rewarding Peak milk consumers with promo vouchers and other instant gifts. A second leg of the campaign was the Peakmas Virtual Treasure Hunt, where consumers participated in a virtual treasure hunt for a Peakmas chest, using their mobile devices. Winners of the hunt were also rewarded with amazing prizes from the brand.  Speaking on the campaign, Peak Brand Manager, Oluwafeyisola Alabi said that the #ShareLoveShareNourishment campaign, enabled an exciting Christmas for Peak milk customers and added extra Peakmas love to the celebrations. “There are people around you who prove to be good and true all year and deserve to be rewarded. Hence, the reason to have celebrated the festive season with our consumers by showing them love and appreciation, and encouraged them to pass it down” Alabi said.
