An explosive device suspected to have been planted by terrorists detonated at the Catholic Chapel of St. John’s College, Mutum-Biyu, the headquarters of Gassol Local Government Area, Taraba State. This is happening about 24 hours after the hoodlums killed three family members of the village head of Wuro Bokki in the Gassol LGA of the state. The Principal of the college, Rev. Fr. Emmanuel Ikyaan, told PUNCH Metro that the explosives went up around 7.20pm on Sunday. “We thank God that no life was lost, but the church has been destroyed. About 10 minutes after the explosion in the school, we started to hear gunshots in the town. “The youth and some students were holding a programme in the chapel, which doubled as the school hall; they left the premises shortly before the explosion. “This is a religious ground; if attacks like these are happening in the church, where will people run to? “I want to call for a thorough investigation to unravel those behind the attack and the perpetrators brought to book,” he said. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abdullahi Usman, confirmed the attack in a telephone interview with our correspondent. Usman said, “What happened was that some kidnappers came to abduct the owner of a filling station in the town. Unfortunately for them, they could not achieve their mission. “In the process of running to escape being trapped, they started shooting sporadically to escape. “It was in the process that they threw an explosive device into the church to cause fear to enable them to escape. The explosive blew up and caused some damage to the building.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
