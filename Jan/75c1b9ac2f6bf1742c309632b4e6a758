Former President, Olusegun Obasanjo has called on African leaders to manage the population of the continent in order for it to be an asset rather than a liability. Obasanjo said this on Friday during his address at the 2022 Emeritus Professor Oyewusi Ibidapo-Obe symposium themed, ‘Viewing the world through the lens of big data,’ held on Victoria Island. He said, “African governments should not ignore the overwhelming evidence that the failure of leadership to apply our choices of population management is impeding progress in the continent. “For the avoidance of doubt, Africa Progress Group is now clamouring for a decline in population through policies such as one child per family as we have in some countries of the world. “Our position is rested on the belief that population, large or small, can be harnessed as an asset rather than becoming a problem or a liability. Besides, the viability and socio-cultural positions on family planning by different African communities should be respected but properly managed. Africa’s growing population, if well managed, will yield a great dividend for national and urban development.” The Founder of Zenith Bank Plc, Mr Jim Ovia, explained that big data had altered modern business transactions and user experience in the banking industry.
