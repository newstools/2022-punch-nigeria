About 600 Women groups from different parts of the country will on Tuesday next week converge on Abuja, the nation’s capital, for a solidarity walk for Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State. The solidarity walk is tagged, “One Million Women March for GYB.’’ Under the auspices of Women United For Yahaya Bello, the women groups, including Non-Governmental Organisations, civil society organisations, religious, professional bodies, women in media, politics, market women and top women entrepreneurs, among others, will join the walk to drum support for the governor’s presidential ambition. According to the organisers, the women groups, having come to the conclusion that the nation requires one with pedigree, youthfulness and capacity to succeed the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), took it upon themselves to collectively canvas support for Bello, who they said had demonstrated the ability to resolve the myriad of challenges confronting Nigeria. In a statement issued by the Global Coordinator of WUYABEL, Dr Hanatu Adeeko, to journalists in Abuja, the gathering will be the first of its kind “especially now that the political stage is almost set.’’ Ádeeko said, “This will be the first in a long while that women on their own will come together in their numbers to speak with one voice. We are coming to Abuja to demand that the status quo must be changed. This is the time for us to yield power to younger people, especially those who have given a good account of themselves in other places they’ve rendered service.”
