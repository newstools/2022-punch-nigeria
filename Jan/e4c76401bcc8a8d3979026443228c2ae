The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has said leaders, especially those within the West African sub-region, are bound by duty to do the best for their people despite shrinking resources. Buhari spoke on Friday at the State House, Abuja, when he received in a farewell audience the Ambassador of Burkina Faso, Piabie N’do, who spent eight years on a tour of duty. Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, disclosed this in a statement on Friday titled, ‘We must do the best for our people within the limits of resources, President Buhari tells exiting Burkina Faso Ambassador.’ The President said, “leaders should do the best for their people within the limits of resources.” He also expressed hope that the outgoing Ambassador would deploy the experiences garnered in the field “for decision making in your country when you go back.” On his part, N’do expressed the good wishes of his country and himself to Nigeria, while commending Buhari for incredible diplomacy that had seen Nigerians leading many international organisations. He equally expressed appreciation for the different kinds of support Nigeria gave to Burkina Faso during the flooding crisis, their national elections, and other critical times. N’do said he enjoyed his stay in Nigeria, had his last daughter here, and he held very pleasant memories of the country.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
