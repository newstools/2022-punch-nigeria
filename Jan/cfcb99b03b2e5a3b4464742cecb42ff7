Dozens of people have been killed and several others injured as terrorists believed to be members of the Islamic State West Africa Province group attacked the Galadima Kogo community, Niger State. In a statement signed by the Co-convener of the Concerned Youth of Niger State, Sani Kokki, and made available to our correspondent in Minna on Sunday, the terrorists came into the village with motorcycles shooting indiscriminately. “Over a dozen of people were gruesomely killed and scores of others were as well injured through multiple gunshots. “Yesterday afternoon, rampaging hydra-headed, venomous, murderous, and heartless terrorists well-armed with assorted sophisticated and dangerous weapons stormed Galadima Kogo, Shiroro Local Government Area, Niger State in broad daylight and unleashed mayhem on their victims at sight including unsuspecting innocent and unarmed members of the community. “The terrorists believed to be elements of Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) stormed the community in their large numbers on motorcycles in a convoy and went straight to Security Outfit stationed in the town,” the statement read. According to Kokki, the terrorists burnt down houses and rustled cattle that had been recovered by a team of vigilance group members. “During the deadly invasion, the dreaded criminals set many houses ablaze including other valuables while carting away many herds of cattle that were recovered by Vigilante in their previous encounters with criminals after being rustled,” he said. Kokki blamed the attack on the withdrawal of security operatives from the community, adding that the terrorists must have been informed by their informants that the security personnel have been withdrawn.
