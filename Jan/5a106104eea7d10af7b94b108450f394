Nigerian footballer, Abba Bichi, has advised his followers to desist from blaming religion when an offence is committed. Bichi, who plays for Yingkou Chagoyue FC in China, took to his Instagram page on Saturday to slam those who blame terrorism on Islam. He mentioned that if people called all Muslims terrorists, that means they were sharing the Earth with 1.9 billion terrorists. The footballer wrote, “Learn to blame the individual not his religion or tribe! “If you call the whole religion of Islam as terrorist then imagine sharing a planet, with 1.9 billion terrorist! Does it make sense? “Rather if a Muslim commits a crime blame him alone and leave the whole religion out of it! “Likewise Christianity. Same rule applies! Call out the individual for his mistakes and leave his religion out of the matter.” The footballer is also the son of the Director-General of the Department of State Services, Yusuf Bichi.
