North Dublin side Bohemian FC have launched their new 2022 away shirt, which pays tribute to reggae icon Bob Marley. The announcement was made, on Monday, on the club’s website and social media accounts. According to the club, the concept of the new away shirt was conceived in conjunction with the Marley Estate and the Bravado group who manage Marley merchandise releases. The club said that the jersey commemorates the Jamaican’s last outdoor performance, which took place at Bohs’ Dalymount Park Stadium on 6 July 1980. Dalymount Park Stadium is the home of Bohemian FC, and is historically known as the home of Irish football, having hosted UEFA Champions League qualifiers, UEFA Cup, and UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup matches. 10% of the profits made from the jersey sales, according to the club, will be used to purchase musical instruments and football equipment for people in asylum centres across the country. The club, in 2018, had tried to print an image of the reggae legend’s face on a jersey but abandoned on failing to secure the image rights. Speaking at the launch of the new kit, Bohemian FC Chief Operating Officer Daniel Lambert talked about the connection between Bob Marley and the club. “It brings me enormous joy to unveil this jersey today following years of work on the idea. “The Marley concert at Dalymount is one of Ireland’s truly special musical events, his only ever Irish show and, sadly, his last ever outdoor one. “His love of football is widely known to all, and that he played on our famous pitch before the concert, the same turf that some of the world’s best players have graced such as Pele, Best and Zidane is amazing.” Copyright PUNCH.
