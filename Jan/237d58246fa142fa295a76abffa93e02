A Magistrate Court sitting in Ado, Ado Odo Ota Local Government Area of Ogun State, on Thursday,  remanded one Mrs Elizabeth Joseph, mother of Joshua Joseph, an SS3 Student of Toyan High School, Ere, and a suspected thug  who allegedly beat up a teacher. The student had invaded the school with her parents and some hoodlums to attack the teacher after he was scolded by his teacher for his hairstyle. Magistrate B.O Salam, after listening to the charge read by the prosecuting officer, Inspector Adeyemo, expressed disappointment over the attitude of the parents who followed their wards to school to attack teachers for disciplining their wards. The magistrate said, “Why are these children attacking their teachers? If drastic measure is not taken, these are the kind of youths that will become menace, not only to their teachers, but also to police officers and court officials if they get a judgment that is not satisfactory to them. “If my parents had followed me to my school to fight my teachers, will I be on this bench today?” She admitted that the offence committed was a bailable one, but directed that the suspects be remanded in Abeokuta and Ilaro Correctional Homes, while the student said to be at large be produced by the next court sitting. The case was adjourned till February 15, 2022. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
