The Ogun State Government has been commended for its approach in scaling up the ongoing COVID-19 mass vaccination campaign across the 20 Local Government Areas of the state. This commendation was given by the Chief Executive Officer of APIN Public Health Initiatives, a non-governmental organization, Dr. Prosper Okonkwo, in Abeokuta, while presenting some infection control and prevention materials to the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Tomi Coker. Okonkwo, according to a statement on Wednesday was represented by the Head, Ogun State Office, Mr Michael Ohue, at the event. He said the success recorded with the vaccination campaign against COVID-19 in the state was evidence that the Dapo Abiodun-led government was prioritising the health of residents. Okonkwo urged the people of Ogun State to take advantage of the mass vaccination to get themselves protected against Coronavirus, saying the vaccines were safe and available in various health facilities. He added that APIN, as funded by the US CDC, would not relent in supporting the state government to achieve its set goals in the health sector. “The COVID-19 vaccines are very safe and readily available at health facilities in the state. The healthcare workers at the facilities and designated COVID-19 vaccination sites are available and ready to answer any questions or provide you with any information that you need,” Okonkwo said. Responding, Coker thanked the health partner for its support especially in the area of caring for People Living with HIV/AIDS, calling on well-meaning stakeholders to come on board in assisting the present administration to achieve its various dreams in the health sector.
