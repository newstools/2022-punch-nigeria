The family and friends of a 41-year-old businessman, Mr Azubuike Nwokolo, found dead in a hotel room in Amichi, Nnewi North of Anambra state, have demanded justice. Nwokolo was a father of two and a materials merchant, popularly known as Zubby More. One of the deceased friends, Nnaemeka Ikerionwu, who demanded justice for him on social media said the businessman went for a party in the area before lodging in the hotel On January 13, 2022. It was reported that the management of the hotel took him to the morgue without informing his family. Ikerionwu noted that when his family visited the morgue, Zubby had injuries on his neck and thighs. The hotel management was said to have claimed that he slipped and died. Ikerionwu said, “The Nigeria Police Force Nnewi South division should thoroughly investigate the death of Zubby more because the claim made by the Hotel in Amichi doesn’t add up. “They claimed Azubuike fell in the bathroom and died but my cousin who visited the mortuary said he had injuries in the neck and laps. “I know Umuhu has gallant men who wouldn’t allow this ugly incident to go down the drain. How do you take someone to the mortuary without contacting the police or his family members first? “Zubby was a very calm and hard-working entrepreneur. It’s sad that this is even happening. Very sad. I was totally devastated since I received this ugly news. No stone must be left unturned.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
