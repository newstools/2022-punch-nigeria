The institution’s Public Relations Officer, Abubakar Ibrahim, confirmed the incident in a statement made available to our correspondent in Lafia on Friday. He explained that the gunmen stormed the university premises which is located in Mararaba community at about 11:30 pm on Thursday and kidnapped the students but said efforts were being made to secure their release. “The Management of the Federal University of Lafia regret to announce that four students of the university were kidnapped by unknown gunmen on Thursday, January 13, 2022, at around 11:30 p.m. “The Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof. Shehu Abdul Rahman, on behalf of the management of the institution, expressed his profound outrage at the unfortunate development and condemned it in strong terms and demand  the immediate release of those kidnapped. “The vice-chancellor, who has since visited the area where the students were kidnapped, visited the Nasarawa Police Command where he formally notified the Commissioner of Police about the abduction of the students,” the statement read in part.
