One policeman and a businessman have been killed as a result of gang fights which has become a norm within Minna, the Niger State capital, as the government and security agencies seem to be unable to find a solution to these fights that have led to the loss of lives and properties. The fight is usually between youths of different areas who choose the streets of Minna as their battlefield. Security personnel were able to quell the clash which started on Thursday between the youth of Limawa and Ogbomosho areas. On Friday morning, they regrouped and disrupted the Minna central area, dispersing business owners who had to lock their shops and scamper to safety. Our correspondent gathered that in the process of the clash, one of the traders whose shop is located along Ogbomosho Road was stabbed and later died in the hospital. There are conflicting reports on how the policeman died. While some said he was mistakenly killed by his colleague, others said it was the clashing youths that killed him. The policeman was said to have been among those drafted to the area to control the clash and protect other citizens. The majority of the shops in the area have remained closed. Gang clashes have become frequent in Minna, making residents and commuters live in fear as the fights occur on major roads with the gang members fighting with stones and knives. Residents usually get attacked, injured, have their goods stolen while windshields of cars get shattered in the course of such fights. A call put through to the Niger State Police Command Public Relations Officer, DSP Wasiu Abiodun, went unanswered as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
