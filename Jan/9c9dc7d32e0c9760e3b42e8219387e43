The Cathedral Administrator, Church of Nigeria Anglican Communion, Diocese of Nnewi, Ven. Benjamin Ilee, has called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to avoid election distraction and focus on good governance especially as 2022 is a year preceding a major election year in the country. Speaking with our correspondent on the sidelines of a town hall meeting in Nnewi, Anambra State, on Monday, Ilee noted that Nigerians have been denied good governance over the years and the year 2022 is an opportunity for Buhari to give Nigerians good governance before leaving office in 2023. The cleric also commended the President for ensuring that the Anambra election, against all odds, went successfully. He added that the church, as an institution, has a vital role to play in nation building by offering quality advise and direction to the leaders of the country. He said, “This year is a critical year for us as a nation because it is a year preceding major elections. And as usual, politics and elections matters will dominate the space. “But I will advise the President to focus on good governance and avoid distraction. He has the opportunity to worm himself back into the hearts of Nigerians by providing the necessary enablements for the prosperity of all Nigerians. “Every year that precedes a major election year is always filled with unnecessary tension in the polity, all the President needs to do is to empower necessary institutions to effectively carry out their functions. “The church has a role to play in ensuring peaceful coexistence among the community. This we do by making conscious efforts at conflict resolution through preaching message of peace, hope and love.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
