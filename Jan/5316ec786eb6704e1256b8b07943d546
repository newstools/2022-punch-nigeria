THE Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, Delta State chapter, Mr Sylvester Imonina, has resigned his appointment and dumped the party. Imonina who tendered his resignation letter dated January 18, 2022, to the state party chairman, said he threw in the towel due to “unpalatable circumstances.” In the letter made available to journalists in Asaba on Wednesday, Imonina said, “Due to the state of affairs of the All Progressives Congress, Delta State chapter, I, Ogheneluemu Sylvester Imonina, herein resign my membership of the party and my position as the acting State Publicity Secretary.” He thanked the leadership of the party at the local governments level and his kinsmen for finding him worthy to serve. The letter routed through the ward chairman, Isoko North Ward 11, Ozoro Ward 3 thanked all party faithful for assisting him to add his quota to the development of the party. However, it was learnt that Imonina dumped the party because he was alleged to have been sidelined by the Deputy Senate President, Chief Ovie Omo-Agege, who was alleged to be “running the affairs of the state party like a personal estate”. Confirming the resignation letter to our correspondent, Imonina said “My brother, what you saw was the true position things. “I have resigned my membership of the SWC of the party due to the state of affairs of the party. I have not made up my mind to join any party now, I just want to sort out myself.” An insider told our correspondent that Imonina had concluded plans to join the Peoples Democratic Party at a mega rally billed for Saturday in Asaba.
