The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Kwara State Command, has established a female squad to provide security in schools across the state. The newly-established squad is set up to tackle the abduction of school children in the state. The State Commandant of NSCDC, Makinde Ayinla, announced this in Ilorin, the state capital, on Tuesday while briefing journalists on the activities of the agency in 2021. “A female squad that will keep watch over our schools to checkmate students’ abduction will be unveiled this month. “We have trained some selected personnel on this and with the permission of the state governor, we will deploy them to schools this month,” Ayinla said. The commandant said the agency would deal ruthlessly with vandals this year in its efforts to prevent economic sabotage and safeguard government’s installations. He added that the agency will work in conjunction with the Nigeria Customs Service to tackle smugglers in border towns across the state. Ayinla also hinted about the preparedness of the NSCDC to keep 24 hours surveillance on correctional centres to forestall any breach of security in the facilities. He said the agency would intensify efforts on the training of its officers, especially on weapon handling as well as intelligence and information gathering to further aid their performance. He disclosed that the agency’s Agro-Ranger Unit, in 2021, handled 76 cases on agro-allied matters and farmers/ herders clashes, adding that 63 of the cases were resolved. Copyright PUNCH.
