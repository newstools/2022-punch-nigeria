The Federal Capital Territory Council of the National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives has lamented that the killers of one of its members, Grace Dauda, are yet to be apprehended. This as the group called for improvement on security intelligence and surveillance in the FCT and its environs. Dauda was murdered on January 5 at her residence in Auta Balefi, Karu Local Area of Nasarawa State, by unknown persons. She was, until her death, the Chief Nursing Officer of Federal Medical Centre, Jabi, Abuja. Addressing Journalists in Abuja on Tuesday, the Chairman of the association, Deborah Yusuf called on security agencies to fish out the killers of Dauda, adding that the association would not rest until this was done. Yusuf said, “The feeling of loss is so great. It is visceral. With great sorrow in our hearts, we mourn one of our dedicated, committed and reliable members. “It is really a monumental loss to the entire nursing community in Nigeria. We commiserate with her family on this painful loss. We pray for the repose of her soul. “Whatever the reason for this most unnatural and barbaric act of man’s inhumanity to man, we want to stress that nobody has the right to take life except God,” Yusuf said. She implored governments at all levels to take the security of lives and property of the citizens seriously, as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution. According to her, it is alarming the rate of terrorism, banditry and kidnap-for-ransom across the length and breadth of the country. Yusuf, however, enjoined nurses and midwives to be more security conscious, law-abiding and report any suspicious moves around their environs to relevant authorities. Copyright PUNCH.
