A pressure group, Ekiti Political Intervention Coalition, has asked the National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party under the chairman of Iyorchia Ayu to “immediately cancel the botched PDP three-ad-hoc delegates congress” that purportedly held in Ekiti last Saturday. The group made the call in a statement on Tuesday by its Public Relations Officer, Banji Dada. “For the PDP to rescue and rebuild Nigeria, the process must begin from within, and the national chairman must be bold in leading the NWC and the party to take decisions that will salvage the party in Ekiti State,” the statement read. The group wondered why the party has continued to indulge what it described as the excesses of former Governor Ayodele Fayose. It added, “Is it not a big shame that the PDP is being tossed around by Fayose, denying his aspirant a voice and using every trick in the book to corner a ticket that he wants to sell later to another interest to undo the PDP? “We want the chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, to know that a party that wants to rescue and rebuild Nigeria will not be indulging a man who attempted to truncate the last national convention of the PDP through his cronies but failed.”
