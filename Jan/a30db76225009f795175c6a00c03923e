Some traders and apprentices at the International Electrical Market, Obosi/Onitsha, Anambra State, on Saturday, reportedly protested against a trader for allegedly settling his apprentice with N100,000, nine years after serving him. PUNCH Metro learnt that the protest took place in front of the man’s shop, as the group sang solidarity songs and chanted, ‘Enough is enough; the revolution has started.’ They were said to have demanded that the master treat his apprentice fairly by increasing the payment, adding that the apprentice did not deserve a meagre N100,000 for nine years of service. In his reaction, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Anambra Broadcasting Service, Chief Uche Nworah, said the organisation had noted the abuse in the apprenticeship system and was partnering the Awka Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture to convene a summit on Igbo apprenticeship. Nworah noted that the summit, themed, ‘Repositioning Igbo Apprenticeship Scheme (Igba -Boi) for Sustainable Economic Development,’ would X-ray the Igbo apprenticeship scheme, bring out the positives and recommend areas for improvement for the scheme to continue to be relevant in the 21st century.
