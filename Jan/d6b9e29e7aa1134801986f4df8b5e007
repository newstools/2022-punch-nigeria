The Delta State Government has concluded plans to sell the independent power plant in Oghara, in the Ethiope West Local Government Area of the state. The N23.2bn project was established during the administration of a former governor, Emmanuel Uduaghan. However, the Commissioner for Information, Mr Charles Aniagwu, said that the State Executive Council presided by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa on Thursday gave approval for a programme that would enable the IPP to come on stream by bringing in independent power generating companies under lease to own it. Aniagwu said, “We have some turbines and equipment that they (the power generating companies) need to buy. We will bring them in and they will pay us some money from the beginning to some time and they will own the plant thereafter. “The state government took the measure because it does not want to engage in the outright sale of the IPP” The commissioner said the council also approved an upward review of the contract cost of the Ayakoromo Bridge project from N6bn to N10.5bn. He said the review was part of decisions reached at the first council meeting in 2022. Aniagwu further explained that the contract for the construction of the bridge, which was awarded in 2013, had to be reviewed as a result of present economic realities in the country. He said that the project was a priority to the present administration in the state, adding that it was expected to be completed and inaugurated within the next 15 months.  Copyright PUNCH.
