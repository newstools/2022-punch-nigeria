The Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, Ignatius Kaigama, has said that insecurity is threatening the survival of the education sector, especially private universities. Kaigama said this while speaking at the mass service for the 10th convocation ceremony of Veritas University in Bwari, Abuja. The Archbishop lamented that the incessant attacks by bandits on the education sector threatens the existence of private universities and puts them at risk. Kaigama said: ”The attacks by bandits and other criminal elements on the education sector do not only affect the safety of students and staff in schools but also directly or indirectly affect the survival of private universities.” The Bishop further called on the government to take drastic measures to improve security in university campuses to secure the lives of students. ”I, therefore, wish to use this medium to call on the government to take drastic steps to improve on the security and safety of lives and properties in and around university campuses across Nigeria. “This is in order to ensure their continued well-being,” Kaigama said. The Vice-Chancellor of the school, Prof. Hyacinth Ichoku, while congratulating the graduands, urged them to always remember to put into practice all the that was taught to them, in their future endeavors. ”Never allow the success you attain in life to make you forget your humble beginnings especially at Veritas University. “Cherish the friendship you have made with one another and never forget your lecturers and staff who contributed in making you who you are. “Always remember the lessons instilled in you here. Be courageous to stand for the truth as long as you have a choice.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
