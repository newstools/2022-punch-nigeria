Suspected Kidnappers allegedly killed a policeman and kidnapped an expatriate supervising Agbede/Anwain Road construction in Idegun, Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo State on Monday. The policeman was attached to the expatriate. An eyewitness, who would not want his name in print, explained that the incident happened on Monday during an inspection of the road by the expatriate. He said five armed men came out from the bush, killed the policeman and took the foreigner away. The source said the suspected kidnappers came on foot from neighbouring Uromi, Esan North East Local Government Area of the state. The source added that the villagers in company with local vigilante groups set out shortly after the incident, combing the bush in a futile effort to rescue the foreigner. When contacted, spokesman of the state police command, Mr. Kontongs Bello, said he was yet to be briefed on the issue, saying that he would speak on the incident once he gets the details.
