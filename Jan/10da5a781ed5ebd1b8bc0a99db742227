A former Chief Whip of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mr Rotimi Abiru, has called on the youth to be actively involved in politics to engender the country’s development. The lawmaker representing Shomolu State Constituency II, who spoke in Lagos on Saturday, noted that the Nigeria dream was in the hands of youths. “Elections are not won on social media or pages of newspapers. For those who find faults and criticise from the corners of their rooms, this is the time to participate in the ongoing voter registration. It’s important for everyone to get involved for mass participation and the betterment of our country,” he stated. Abiru stressed that youths constituted over 65 per cent of the country’s population, stating that their involvement in politics and governance would point the way forward for the country. “This is the time for the civil society to save this country from retrogression by encouraging youths to take active part in politicking,” he said. The lawmaker said the state government was committed to ensuring continued peace, stability and unity to protect the lives and property of residents. He also assured residents of the state that the All Progressives Congress administration was committed to delivering meaningful governance in the state. Abiru described the recently passed appropriation bill in Lagos as a budget of hope and stability for Lagosians, adding, “These successes are achieved because there’s independence and also a good working relationship between the legislature and the executive.” Copyright PUNCH.
