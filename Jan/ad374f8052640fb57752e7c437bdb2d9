Popular cross-dresser, Idris Okuneye, fondly known as Bobrisky, has tendered a public apology for asking the Oba of Benin, Omo N’Oba N’Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Ewuare II, to “come and marry” him. He made the comment in a video he shared to express his excitement at being in Benin for an event by celebrity interior designer, Ehi Ogbebor. In the earlier video, Bobrisky had said, “We’re here to disturb Benin. Oba of Benin, Bob has entered. I have entered. Come and marry me.” However, after getting slammed by Benin indigenes for calling out their traditional head, Bobrisky has tendered a public apology. He shared the apology on his Instagram story, where he noted that he was just joking when he made the comment. In his apology, Bobrisky said, “Earlier today, I made a statement about the Oba of Benin and a lot of you didn’t find it funny. “I know. I’m so sorry. I’m actually a jovial person and I play a lot. I’m here to apologise to the great Oba of Benin and to the palace of Benin, that I am sorry.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
