The Bishop of the Diocese of Lagos West Anglican Communion, Rt. Rev. James Odedeji, has called on Nigerians to seek divine guidance in their life journey. Odedeji, according to a statement on Wednesday said this in his sermon delivered at the New Year thanksgiving service held at the Archbishop Vining Memorial Church Cathedral, Ikeja. He said, “We see from Psalm 9 that the eternal God, through the shining star, led the wise men to the worship of His Son. This points to the truth that divine guidance is a necessity if mankind must finish gloriously. “Divine guidance is all about God leading, being the only One who can lead successfully; even though mighty men/women abound in the world, there is only one almighty in the universe.” The bishop added that divine guidance does not eliminate life’s challenges. “This guidance does not foreclose tribulations and difficulties or challenges in life, but one is assured of victory when the siege is over. God’s guidance operates through His words, spirit, servants, dreams, sermons, Christian movies and through literature,” he said.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
