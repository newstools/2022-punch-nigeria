A Kano State Chief Magistrate Court sitting at Gidan Murtala has remanded the wife of the alleged kidnapper and killer of five-year-old girl, Jamila Abdulmalik Muhammad Sani. Jamila was arraigned on a charge of alleged concealing of a kidnap victim. Jamila, a 30-year-old woman, is the wife to Abdulmalik Tanko, who is standing trial on four charges of concealing a kidnapped victim, conspiracy, kidnapping and culpable homicide. The prosecution alleged that she concealed a kidnapped victim in her house for the period of five days ”That you Jamila Muhammad Sani, a wife to Abdulmalik Tanko Muhammad, a proprietor and teacher of Noble Kids Comprehensive Academy located at Kwanar Dakata in Kano State, on the 4th December 2021 around 1830hrs your husband brought to you Hanifa Abubakar a 5-year-old pupil, wearing her school uniform and spent five days in your custody. “You kept her (Hanifa) hostage knowing fully that she was kidnapped by your husband and you refused to disclose it to any person,” the First Information Report stated. According to the prosecution, the offence contravenes Section 227 of the Penal Code. Jamila, however, denied the content of the First Information Report read by the prosecutor.
