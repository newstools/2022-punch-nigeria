Local hunters and men of the Adamawa State Police Command have dislodged bandits from their hideout in the Gangtum district of the Ganye Local Government Area of the state. The raid on the hideout, which lasted several hours, resulted in the rescue of 60-year-old Abdullahi Buba and one Halima Ishaku. The command’s spokesman, DSP Sueliman Nguroje, said in a statement that the operation, which was carried out by personnel of the Ganye Division and hunters from Ganye at the Shiga da Niya Hill situated at a remote side of Gangtum village, yielded positive results. The victims were said to have been kidnapped by the gang on January 19, 2022 and were taken to the hideout, while ransom was being negotiated. Two of the suspects were neutralised during the exchange of gunfire, while others escaped with bullet wounds. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
