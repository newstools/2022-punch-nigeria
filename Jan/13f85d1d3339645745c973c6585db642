Nigerian celebrity dancer, Kafayat Shafau, popularly known as Kaffy, has noted that she was grateful her marriage failed. The mother-of-two who recently spoke about her divorce had earlier pointed out that she separated from her husband because their destinies do not align. In a video on Monday night, the choreographer had revealed that she wanted the best for her ex-husband, Joseph Ameh, even though they were separated. Taking to her Instagram page on Wednesday, the dancer noted that she was grateful her marriage failed because she was blind and could now see. Kaffy said this while appreciating those who checked up on her following her divorce announcement. She said, “Those who know me know l am more than a dancer. I explore my full humanity through dance. I am an advocate for human excellence and productivity. “My marriage failed for so many reasons and I am grateful I failed because I was blind and now I see. “Follow me and I will show you what I saw so you won’t fall like me . And if you do, you shall rise.” She added that she had launched a new podcast to enable her to share her experiences. Kaffy added, “My truth has set me free from a lot that was wrongfully conditioned by various elements and one step at a time, I will share my mistakes, how I identified them, surviving depression, my process to healing, the kind of help I got, and so many life lessons I learnt and still learning (I will always be a learner for life). “People need to know! A life out there can be saved, a marriage out there can do better than mine and more importantly, a second chance is always there for us all to take!” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
