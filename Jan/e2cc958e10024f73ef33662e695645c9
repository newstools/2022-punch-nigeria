A man, Damilola Oloto, has been released from a custodial centre where he was remanded since January 2021 over charges of assault and threat to life. The 30-year-old was remanded after his arraignment before an Ebute Metta Magistrate’s Court for allegedly assaulting one Joseph Michael during a fight. The charges read in part, “That you, Damilola Oloto, on January 10, 2021 at about 3pm, at Big Joe Park, Oyingbo, Ebute Metta, Lagos, in the Lagos Magisterial District, did assault one Joseph Michael and inflict injury on his left hand. “That you, Damilola Oloto, on the same date, time and place in the aforementioned magisterial district, did threaten to kill one Joseph Michael with a knife, thereby committing an offence punishable under Section 56 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State of Nigeria, 2015.” A prison warden, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Oloto had been brought to court many times but the absence of the complainant made the case to drag for one year. “All this time we were bringing him to court, the complainant was not available for the case,” he added. The Magistrate, Mrs Kayode Alade, who dismissed the case, said the period Oloto was in custody was as good as serving the term for the offence. Oloto, who spoke amid tears, said he had learnt his lesson. He said, “I have learnt my lesson and in future, this will not repeat itself.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
