The former Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party in Edo State and ex-executive member of the party in South-South, Prince Omo-Osunde Iyasere, has described as unfortunate the Channels Television interview in which the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), described the opposition party as a failure. While noting that the President has the right to his own opinion, Iyasere stated that by the definition of failure, his government and by extension, the ruling All Progressive Congress have failed abysmally. “The President came to power on four-fold promises of rescuing Nigeria from corruption, unemployment, poverty, and insecurity, how many has he fulfilled? Where has he excelled? Today, you can’t go to the farm, but the President is asking people to go to the land. Which land? Is it the one that has been taken over by herdsmen, Boko Haram, and insurgents? “Today, we are in a failed state. Armed men have taken over the Nigerian State. Before he took over in 2015, was Nigeria like this? If you open the pages of newspapers or the television, you see the number of people being killed every day. “Today, I cannot go to Abuja from Benin by road because of insecurity. Buhari should tell us what he meant by PDP being a failure.” “Looking at economic indices today and when Buhari took over in 2015, have Nigerians fared better? What was the cost of living in 2015? What was the inflation rate then compared to now? How much was a bag of rice sold then? What was the exchange rate then? I don’t understand what Buhari is talking about,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
