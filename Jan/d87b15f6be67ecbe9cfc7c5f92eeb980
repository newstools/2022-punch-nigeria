A presidential hopeful, Kingsley Moghalu, on Wednesday, said he forgot to inform the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), of his intention to run for President in the 2023 general elections. “I forgot to inform President @Mbuhari that I am running for President. But I informed Nigerians, of whom he is one, so no wahala (problem)!” he tweeted. Moghalu, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, was the presidential candidate of the Young Progressive Party in 2019 but he lost the election to Buhari. He joined the African Democratic Congress in 2021 and declared his intention to run for the exalted office in Aso Villa again in 2023. Moghalu’s tweet followed the declaration by All Progressives Congress National Leader, Bola Tinubu; and Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi; that they would be running for President in 2023. The two APC members had separately visited Buhari in Aso Villa this week and informed the President of their intention to contest the next presidential election. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
