Ahead of the 2023 general elections, Anioma socio-political group in Delta State, Odinma Anioma, has declared to rally round for victory of the All Progressives Congress in the state come 2023. The group made the assertion on Thursday in Asaba during a meeting of coordinators and representatives from the Nine Local Government Areas that made up Delta North Senatorial district. Addressing the group at Ogbeke Square, Asaba, the convener, Theodora Ndah, the Ada of Ahaba, declared that the APC was better positioned now than ever to take over Delta State Government in the 2023 general election. According to her, the internal issues within the APC in Delta State were normal and would be resolved as the party moved towards its National convention. She said, “Odinma Anioma is here to stay. Let all members continue to mobilise support for the APC. APC in Delta North is very ready for the 2023 election. I can assure you that we have the necessary machinery to torpedo any boat of opposition. “Grassroots support remains the foundation for any political party. We as a group recognize that and will continue to build solidly on that support.” The Convener also charged the group to ensure massive voter registrations in their areas, stressing that the mandate of the group was to mobilise voters for the APC and there was no better way to go about it than to boost voters registration.
