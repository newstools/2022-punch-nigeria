The Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria has inducted a new set of fellows into the professional rank of the advertising industry. At the induction ceremony in Lagos on Wednesday, the Registrar/Chief Executive, APCON, Dr Olalekan Fadolapo, congratulated the advertising practitioners who were inducted into the fellowship cadre of the advertising profession. He said they had satisfactorily met the required criteria stipulated by law and consequently attained the highest and distinguished class in the profession. He said, “This is a delightful moment for APCON and the advertising industry, particularly being that the last fellows’ induction held over 10 years ago. In the course of my two-and-a-half decades in this industry, I have known each of the inductee personally and I have worked with virtually every one of them in different capacities and therefore I can attest that none of the fellows inducted today lacked the professional aptitude to be designated as such. I am proud to affirm that all of them are eminently qualified to be in the category which they are today made to be. “I am optimistic that with the status that comes with your elevation in the advertising industry, you will diligently represent the profession in all progressive ramifications and resourcefully apply your position to promote the best interest of the profession.” Copyright PUNCH.
