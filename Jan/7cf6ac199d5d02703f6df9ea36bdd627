Tesla is set to recall more than 475,000 cars in the US, according to documents filed with the US safety regulator. According to the BBC, the electric vehicle firm announced it was recalling 356,309 vehicles because of potential rear-view camera issues affecting 2017-2020 Model 3 Teslas. It said a further 119,009 Model S vehicles will be recalled because of potential problems with their front trunk, or boot. This brings the total recall figure to almost the 500,000 cars Tesla delivered last year. A safety report, submitted this month, estimates that around 1 per cent of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rear-view camera. Over time repeated opening and closing of the trunk lid may cause excessive wear to a cable that provides the rear-view camera feed, says a Safety Recall report submitted by Tesla to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the US in December. The report said, “If the wear causes the core of the cable to separate “the rear-view camera feed is not visible on the centre display. The loss of the review camera display may increase the risk of collision.” The Model S recall involves vehicles manufactured between 2014-2021, some of which may have a problem with a secondary latch on the front trunk, or boot. In another Safety Recall report, Tesla said the fault could mean, if the primary latch is inadvertently released, the front trunk may open without warning and obstruct the driver’s visibility, increasing the risk of a crash. According to the report, around 14 per cent of recalled Model S’s may have the defect. In both cases, the reports said, “Tesla is not aware of any crashes, injuries, or deaths relating to the potential faults.” This latest recall is not the first safety issue to have prompted action from the electric vehicle firm. Last week Tesla agreed to make changes to its Passenger Play feature, which allows games to be played on its touchscreen while the car is in motion.
