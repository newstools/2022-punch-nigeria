Nollywood actor, Deyemi Okanlawon has showered praises on his wife, Damilola, as they celebrate their ninth wedding anniversary. Posting a series of pictures of himself and his wife on his Instagram page on Wednesday, the King of Boys actor said his wife had an entrapping pair of eyes. “Beware of this kind of ‘entrapment’ eyes. You will just fall in love before you know it and wake up one day married with children! Thanks for being such a blessing to me and to the boys,” he wrote in the caption. The actor further described her as ‘much more than just an I love you!’” “You’re my everything, my forever, my once-in-a-lifetime love. You’re my always in a world of hardly ever. You’re my happy ending, my new beginning, my all, my one and only,” he said. Okanlawon, however, made it clear that contrary to what the pictures depicted, his marriage was not perfect. According to him, they had “a lot of disagreements, not speaking, plus the once or twice in a year outbursts of ‘I’m leaving’” He continued, “I am so flawed and make a lot of mistakes but I’m truly putting in the work to be a better human – Christian, husband, father, son, brother, friend, colleague, mentee, mentor, and citizen. God help me and my fellow menfolk (especially those of us that are handsome).” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
