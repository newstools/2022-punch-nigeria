The Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri, has invented a fossil-free car with 90 per cent local content. Speaking on Monday, the inventor and head engineer, Mr Pius Nwosu, said that the car was a product of a research. In his speech, the Rector of the Polytechnic, Dr Michael Arimanwa, thanked Nwosu for making the Polytechnic proud. He commended the team for their unwavering commitment in executing the project, promising to give them all necessary support in giving the invention the needed visibility. He said, “The polytechnic will take this project to Inov-8 hub which is connected to Skill G innovation centre Abuja, where potential inventors from all the world can see it and invest heavily on it. From there, the Federal Government through the Ministry of Science and Technology can take it over and enlist it in the budget”. To further encourage Nwosu, Arimanwa announced that the polytechnic would issue him a commendation letter subject to his formal submission of the details of the vehicle, from conception, and research to invention. Reacting, Nwosu pointed out that the Nigerian environment needed vehicle that would be eco-friendly as a result of pollution in the eco-system. He added that the electric car is a solution in circumventing dangerous emission emanating from the engines of fuel-powered vehicles. He stated that over 90 per cent of the materials for invention were locally sourced, adding that the product was a clear testimony that Nigeria has capacity to produce cars locally. Nwosu, however, revealed that it took him and his team about six months to produce the vehicle. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
