Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Saturday celebrated his wife, Ibijoke, for managing the home despite being First Lady. Sanwo-Olu did this while celebrating his wife on her birthday, as he shared their loved-up pictures on his social media pages. In the birthday message addressed to his “delectable” wife, the Governor hailed his wife for being his support and source of strength. The Governor wrote, “You have been my source of strength, my prayer partner, my happy place, my supporter, my cheerleader, the co-pilot in our home, and most importantly an exemplary mother to our children. “There are no words adequate enough to describe, and appreciate you for your strength, resilience, understanding and selflessness as we paddle the waters of Governance in Lagos. “Thank you for holding forth and strong in managing the home front while also taking on the role of First Lady. “Thank you for your passion in speaking up against Domestic and Gender Based Violence. Thank you for seeing the vision of a Greater Lagos with me. “And thank you for sharing my true intentions for a progressive, developed, and secured Lagos, despite being misunderstood. “As you celebrate another year of grace and favour from God, may the Almighty continue to abide with you all the days of your life. Amen “Happy Birthday my dear wife, Dr. Ibijoke Claudiana Sanwo-Olu.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
