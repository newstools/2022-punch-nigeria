The Athletics Federation of Nigeria has postponed this weekend’s All-Comers competition as a mark of honour for the fallen Brown Ebewele. Ebewele died on December 31, 2021 after a brief illness. The competition, scheduled for Asaba, clashes with the funeral rites for the former AFN Technical Director Ebewele, who will be buried on Friday in Uromi, Esan North East Local Government, Edo State.  In a statement signed by Adeniyi Beyioku, the AFN Secretary General, the postponement became necessary because of the former Nigeria decathlon champion’s burial programme, which begins with a vigil mass on Thursday at his Benin City residence. “The postponement of the AFN All-Comers competition is in honour of our departed hero, Brown Ebewele, whose burial ceremony is scheduled to hold from January 27 to 30, 2022,” the statement read. After the vigil mass on Thursday, there will be a lying-in-state at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin City on Friday morning. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
