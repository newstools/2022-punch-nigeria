Manchester United striker, Cristiano Ronaldo, has said he is not happy with what is being achieved at the club. In a message celebrating the end of the year 2021, Ronaldo urged the club to do better and deliver more than what is being done at the moment. He called for the year 2022 to be embraced with a higher spirit and stronger mentality to put the club where they belong. He said, “2021 is coming to an end and it was far from being an easy year, despite my 47 goals scored across all competitions. “Two different clubs and five different coaches. One Euro Final Stage played with my National Team and one World Cup Qualification left pending for 2022. At Juventus, I was proud to win the Italian Cup and the Italian Supercup, and become the Série A Top Scorer. For Portugal, becoming the Euro Top Scorer was also a high point this year. And of course, my return to Old Trafford will always be one of the most iconic moments in my career. “But I’m not happy with what we are achieving in Man. United. None of us is happy, I’m sure of that. We know that we have to work harder, play better and deliver way more than we are delivering right now. “Let’s make this New Year’s Eve a turning point of the season! Let’s embrace 2022 with a higher spirit and a stronger mentality. “Let’s take us above and beyond, let’s reach for the stars and put this club right where it belongs! Join us, we’re counting on all of you! “Happy New Year and see you soon!” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
