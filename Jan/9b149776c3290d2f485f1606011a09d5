The tactics deployed by Carlos Querioz against Nigeria in their opening Group D fixture last Tuesday ruined Egypt’s chances of winning the game, Egyptian journalist Mostafa Hossam has told PUNCH Sports Extra. The Eagles defeated the Pharaohs 1-0 at the Roumde Adjia Stadium, Garoua on Tuesday, with Kelechi Iheanacho’s first half volley earning Nigeria their first win over Egypt at the AFCON in 12 years. Hossam stated that the Portuguese coach got his tactics wrong deploying Liverpool winger Mohamed Salah as a false nine in the defeat. “Querioz’s plan is the worst in the world, he did not play the players in their preferred positions against Nigeria,” Hossam told PUNCH Sports Extra. “Salah was too isolated in that striking role because he rarely got on to the ball. “He can’t play for Egypt the way he does for Liverpool because Querioz can’t handle him well. “Against Nigeria, he also played Mostafa Mohamed, a striker as right winger which ruined the team’s chances. Naturally, Mohamed is a striker. “Players like Trezeguet, who didn’t play for eight months with Aston Villa due to a cruciate ligament injury, were named in the squad for the AFCON. “He depended on players who are not active for their European clubs and have also been poor playing for the national team.” While admitting that the Eagles deserved their win, Hossam suggested the Portuguese tactician is better as an assistant. “Congratulation to Nigeria for winning the game. His (Queiroz) terrible tactics gave the Eagles a chance to dominate the whole game.” Egypt will be seeking to bounce back from Tuesday’s defeat when they face Guinea Bissau on Saturday.
