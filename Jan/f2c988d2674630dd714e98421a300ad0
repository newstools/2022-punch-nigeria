Authorities of Dowen College, Lagos on Monday appealed to members of the public to stop spreading what they described as malicious information against the school over the recent death of its pupil, Sylvester Oromoni (Jnr.). The school authorities said they decided to remain silent since November 30 death of the 12-year-old pupil because they wanted experts, law enforcement agencies, the government and medical authorities, among others to do their jobs and unearth the truth about the incident. The statement read, “At this point, we respectfully request that all those who have consistently, misguidedly and maliciously pushed false information should desist immediately and allow our dear Sylvester’s soul rest peacefully in our Lord’s arms. “The longstanding integrity, values and processes the school worked tirelessly to maintain over the past 24 years were unfairly called to question and dragged through the mud since.” The school authorities said the result of the autopsy conducted on the deceased revealed that there was “no bodily harm, no intoxication, but rather that the young boy suffered and died of pre-existing health conditions that had not been treated.” The school added: “Today the truth wins, our faith wins and our integrity wins. We pray that no school or organisation ever has to experience what we have been going through.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
