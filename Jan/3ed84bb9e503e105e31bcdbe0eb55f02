The Bank of Industry has disbursed $400m to over four million Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises in five years, it has been learnt. This is contained in the BoI Growth Platform’s Aid for Productivity Report launched by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Monday in Abuja. The report, which was co-authored by the BoI Executive Director, Toyin Adedeji, and Chief Operating Officer of the Growth Platform, Uzoma Nwagba, chronicles the development, impact, and future of BoI’s growth platform. Speaking at the event, the VP stated that the MSMEs were funded across seven intervention programmes. The VP said the Growth Platform’s vision was to catalyse sustainable economic growth in emerging markets by empowering MSMEs with capital, skills, and critical resources. According to him, the Growth Platform offers a seamless process, technology, and field infrastructure for funds delivery to the Micro, Small, and Medium businesses. With the power of biometrics, BVN as digital collateral, mobile data capture, mobile wallets, and a 22,000 strong agent network, Osinbajo said the Growth Platform was able to properly target, document, profile, and deliver the social intervention to MSMEs at scale.
