The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has expressed regret for not visiting Zamfara as earlier planned on Thursday, due to bad weather conditions. The President’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, in a statement, said Buhari made his feelings known in a special video and audio broadcast to the people of Zamfara on Thursday evening. The statement was titled, ‘President Buhari sends video/radio broadcast to Zamfara people as bad weather aborts condolence visit’ on Thursday. The text of the broadcast read, “My dear people of Zamfara State. “It pains me that I can no longer be with you today as I had planned. I had just finished what I came to do in Sokoto at the BUA cement facility and was looking forward to meeting you. “I have been told that the trip cannot hold anymore because of bad weather which has made it impossible for my helicopter to fly to Gusau from Sokoto. “I understand how you feel about this development but I know that you will agree with me that Allah knows best. I particularly sympathize with your Governor, Bello Matawalle and his cabinet who have put everything in place to make the visit a successful one. “I look forward to a more weather-friendly period when I will visit. “I am directing our security agencies to sustain the onslaught against terrorists, restrict cross-boundary infiltration and all unauthorised access to the goldmines in the state. “The Federal Government and the Zamfara State Government are working to ensure that peace returns to all parts of the State in the shortest possible time and we expect all citizens to cooperate with, and support in all ways, the Armed Forces and other security agencies.” Copyright PUNCH.
