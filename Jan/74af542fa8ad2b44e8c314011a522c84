The Benue State Command of Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps has nabbed a suspected human trafficker with six young girls who she had already prepared to traffick abroad. The suspect identified as Mnena Kwaghmande was intercepted in the Gboko area of Benue State on January 5, 2022, with the victims all ready to travel to Burkina-Faso. The State Commandant of the Defense Corps, Dr Philip Okoh who paraded the suspect and the victims, said that the suspect when interrogated claimed to have told parents of the young girls that they would be helping her to in her restaurant in Burkina Faso. The girls were reportedly picked from the Vandeikya Local Government Area of the state. The Commandant said, “We are showing to the public what we have done so far in terms of securing Benue State and ensuring peace. “Behind me, we have a seasoned trafficker who goes about luring unsuspecting parents through convincing them that they are going abroad for greener pastures. “Investigation has revealed that they were taking them to Burkina Faso. We did this operation in conjunction with NAPTIP. He, however, cautioned parents against releasing their children to people who promised greener pastures abroad, noting that many of such have landed in trouble. Our correspondent observed that the victims were between the ages of 16 and 20 years. The Command also paraded a suspected POS armed robber identified as Iorchivir Caleb, who was arrested with a locally-made pistol, when he was trying to rob a POS merchant along George Akume Way in Makurdi the state capital on January 7, this year.
