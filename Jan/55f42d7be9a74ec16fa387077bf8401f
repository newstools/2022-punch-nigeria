Governor Udom Emmanuel on Sunday put to rest several months of speculations and permutations with the presentation of the state Commissioner of Lands, Pastor Umo Eno, as his preferred candidate to succeed him as governor in 2023. Eno was presented at a well-attended Peoples Democratic Party’s stakeholders’ meeting which took place at the Governor’s Lodge, in Uyo. Former Governor Obong Victor Attah, made the formal presentation of the governor’s successor to the stakeholders which comprised major and leading political chieftains from the three senatorial districts, who all applauded the choice and pledged to work towards his   emergence as the governor of the state come 2023. Speaking after his presentation, Eno revealed how he grew up in a police barracks and how challenging those days were, but he summoned hope to overcome those difficulties. He said he was grateful to God and to Emmanuel for finding him worthy of the onerous task to lead the people of the state and continue the people-focused  and developmental strides of Governor Udom Emmanuel . Bishop Uma Ukpai and the Prelate Emeritus of the Methodist  Church of Nigeria, Dr. Sunday Mbang, prayed for his success, a sentiment that was re-echoed by the Oku Ibom Ibibio and Chairman of State Council of Chiefs, Ntenyin Solomon Etuk. Among those who attended the event, were the Deputy Governor, Mr. Moses Ekpo;  Speaker of the state House  of Assembly, Aniekan Bassey;  Senators Akon Eyakenyi, Effiong  Bob, Ibok Essien, Aloysius Etok; and  former Deputy Governor, Etim Okpoyo,  among others.
