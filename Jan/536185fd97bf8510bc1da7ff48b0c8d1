Sporting Lisbon came from behind to defeat Benfica 2-1 on Saturday to win the Portuguese League Cup for the second year in a row, and fourth time in five seasons. Benfica took the lead in the first half in Leiria thanks to a goal from Everton, but Goncalo Inacio equalised on 49 minutes before Paris Saint-Germain loanee Pablo Sarabia struck the winner for Sporting. Sporting are the reigning league champions but trail leaders Porto by six points after losing two of their past three matches. AFP
