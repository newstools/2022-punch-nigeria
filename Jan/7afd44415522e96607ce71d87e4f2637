The news of the alleged invitation extended to the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Most Rev Mathew Hassan-Kukah, by the Department of State Services has been described as untrue. The Director of Social Communication in the diocese, Rev Fr Christopher Omotosho, advised members of the public to ignore the rumour. “The news that the bishop was summoned for questioning by the DSS regarding his Christmas message cannot be true, because the bishop has yet to receive either a call or mail from the DSS,” he stated. The social media was awash over the weekend with stories of the summons of the bishop by the DSS, a situation that licited reactions from Nigerians. The youth wing of the Christian Association of Nigeria had threatened to mobilise Christians youths across the nation to accompany the bishop to the DSS headquarters in Abuja. Copyright PUNCH.
