The Lagos State Government has said it will preserve the legacy of the late Nigerian rapper, Olanrewaju Fasasi (popularly called Sound Sultan) by hosting the Festac music festival. The Special Adviser to the Lagos State Governor on Tourism, Arts and Culture, Mr Solomon Bonu said this in a statement on Wednesday. Bonu was quoted to have said this during the third edition of the Festac music festival and the first held after the death of Sound Sultan. He said, “The present administration saw the need to support the vision of Sound Sultan, through a company in which he has equity – Naija Ninja Production, to develop more creative minds and take interested youths off the streets. “The Festac music festival was supported by the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture to honour Sound Sultan, preserve his legacy and appreciate his contributions to the music industry, and the festival will hold annually for four days every December.” The Chief Executive Officer of Naija Ninja Production, Mr Dare Fasasi, thanked the state government for the recognition accorded to the festival as part of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s vision to enhance the skills of young, creative and talented Lagosians.
