Super Eagles defender Ola Aina has questioned South African referee, Victor Gomes’s decision to award a penalty to Sudan during their Africa Cup of Nations Group D game on Saturday. Nigeria were cruising 3-0 before the referee awarded a penalty after the Torino defender pulled a Sudanese player’s jersey in the Eagles box in an off-the-ball incident in the 69th minute. Walieldin Khidir converted the spot-kick, sending Maduka Okoye the wrong way to give the North Africans a lifeline. The game ended 3-1, thus denying the three-time African champions a chance to keep a clean sheet. Speaking with the NFF TV, Aina questioned the referee’s decision to awarded the penalty, claiming the ball was nowhere near the two players during the tussle. “It is sad for the team and it is sad for Maduka because he’s been keeping a clean sheet,” the defender said. “What happened was that I wasn’t looking at the player, I would say I held his shirt a little but there is always a little bit of shirt holding. I was just watching the ball and I didn’t see when I stepped on his foot but these things happen. Luckily, we were already 3-0 up and even after they put it away I still thought we were in control of the game. “I understand why the referee gave it as a penalty, but the ball was nowhere near me or the guy and I don’t how it could be awarded as a penalty. On that stepping, I understand because of what has been done.” On their final group game against Guinea-Bissau on Wednesday, Aina said, “Nigerians should expect the same determination. We have to go into the game with confidence and determination that we can get another three points and send signals out to the competition.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
