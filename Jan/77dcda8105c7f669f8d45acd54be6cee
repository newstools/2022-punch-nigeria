Foremost human rights group and civil society organisation, Amnesty International, on Thursday, reacted to the lifting of the ban on the social media platform, Twitter, by the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd). Amnesty described the ban as “illegal in the first place.” The Federal Government had suspended Twitter operations in the country on June 5, 2021. The President subsequently set up a seven-man committee to engage the company, and another 20-member technical committee comprising all relevant government agencies to engage directly with the Twitter team. Amnesty International, in a terse statement posted on its verified Twitter handle, @amnestyInternational, said, “Amnesty International welcomes the lifting of Twitter ban by Nigerian authorities after seven months of depriving Nigerians from exercising their right to freedom of expression on a social media platform that facilitates dialogue and empowers everyone to communicate, hold useful debates and conversations, and demand accountability from the Nigerian authorities. “The Twitter ban was illegal in the first place and an attack on the right to freedom of expression, including online access to information and media freedom. Nigerian authorities must end all acts that violate rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and freedom of the press.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
