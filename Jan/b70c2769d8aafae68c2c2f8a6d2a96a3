The Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Bello, has condemned the attack and kidnapping of some Chinese nationals working in the state two days ago while appealing to security personnel in the state to double efforts towards ensuring their safe return. In a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mary Noel, in Minna on Thursday, the governor expressed concern over the boldness displayed by the terrorists to have attacked the workers while on site despite the presence of security personnel attached to the facility. He emphasized the need for the security agents to bring the criminal activities in some parts of the state to the lowest level particularly now that the perpetrators have recently been declared as terrorists by the federal government. The Niger State Governor, however, commended the efforts of the security personnel who engaged the terrorists. He stated that the abduction will definitely cause a setback on the ongoing project. “The attack is really disturbing as it would cause some setbacks to the Zungeru Dam project which the Federal government has been making efforts to complete in record time,” the Governor added. He expressed sadness over the loss of lives that occurred during the attack adding that it is an unfortunate incident that shouldn’t reoccur in the state. He said, “It really saddened my heart to hear about this attack. It is even more worrisome to know that lives of the labourers were involved. This action might negatively affect the completion of the Zungeru Dam which is of great significance to the country.” “My heart goes out to the family of the labourers that were killed and those that are injured, I pray that Allah will grant them quick recovery.” Copyright PUNCH.
