Following the dearth of agriculture extension services in Gombe, about 50 farmers have been trained by the National Directorate of Employment. The NDE also said measures had been put in place to end the disproportionate ratio of one worker to 2,000 farmers in the field. Speaking on Friday during the training, the NDE Director General, Abubakar Fikpo, said the beneficiaries were carefully selected and trained to mitigate food crisis. Fikpo, who was represented by the state Coordinator of the agency, Mustapha Hassan, urged the participants to transfer the knowledge garnered in improving the production of crops within their communities. He said, “Currently 50 persons are been trained on agriculture extension. The essence is to empower them with requisite skills to step it down to other farmers. This training is for unemployed persons that will further retrain locals at the community level.” Also speaking, the Director Rural Employment Promotion, NDE, Dr. Mbata Michael, who was represented by Faruq Abdulkareem, Senior Rural Employment Officer, revealed that extension service played key roles in ensuring food security. “Based on what we are seeing, we are looking at one extension agent to almost 2,000 farmers. We want to see how we can reduce that gap. We want to see how individual farmers can transfer knowledge the youths or to other farmers. Then we can have higher productivity, tackle food security and by extension tackle poverty,” Michael said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
