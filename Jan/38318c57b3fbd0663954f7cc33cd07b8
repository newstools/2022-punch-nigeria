The President, Major Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and the national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, are in a closed-door meeting at the Aso Rock Villa, Abuja. The former Governor of Lagos State was not accompanied by any principal member of the APC. Tinubu’s visit comes days after Buhari warned members of the APC that they may lose the 2023 general elections to the Peoples Democratic Party if they refused to settle their differences. Details of the ongoing meeting between President Buhari and Tinubu have not been made public at this time, with speculations from different quarters suggesting it is regarding the 2023 elections. As one of the founding members of the party, Tinubu has been touted has to succeed President Buhari after his tenure ends in May 2023, receiving endorsements from different both political and sociocultural groups. The last time Tinubu visited President Buhari was in October 2021. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
