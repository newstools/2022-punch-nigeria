Scottish champions Rangers have signed forward Amad Diallo on loan from Manchester United until the end of the season. The 19-year-old winger goes straight into Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s squad for Saturday’s match at Ross County. “I am delighted to join Rangers until the end of the season,” Diallo said. “It is fantastic for me at this stage of my career to have the opportunity to come to such a big club that is challenging on a number of fronts and will give me some excellent opportunities to test myself in many environments. “I look forward to training with my teammates for the first-time tomorrow and to meeting the fans for the first time at Ross County on Saturday.” Rangers manager, Giovanni van Bronckhorst, added: “I am really pleased to add Amad to our squad for the rest of the season. “He is a player who I have been aware of for some time, and when the opportunity to sign him came up, we very keen to make it happen. “He will add a lot to our squad and provide even more competition for the players in the forward areas.”
