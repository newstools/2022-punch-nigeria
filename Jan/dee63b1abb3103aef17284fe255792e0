Nollywood actress, Iyabo Ojo, on Thursday revealed how she started her journey as a single mum. Taking to her Instagram page in the early hours of the morning, the mother-of-two shared an old picture of herself and her kids while they were still much younger. In the caption, Ojo detailed how she started her journey as a single mum without direction and with confusion. She wrote, “This year, I began my journey as a single mum with no direction. I was afraid, sometimes depressed, confused, and I always had a lot of anxiety. “I felt like a failure; a loser. I felt I wasn’t good enough, I felt little, I didn’t really know how to fit in or even start. “How was I even going to pull through? I never thought of making it in life. I just wanted my kids to be fine, that was my ultimate goal. “All I knew to do was to love my kids immensely and give them all of me and that inspired me to keep moving. “Today I look back and all I want to say is thank you Lord. “It’s never too late to start all over again. It will be tough but you will be fine. There is always light at the end of the tunnel.” See throwback picture below: Ojo is the mother of two children, Festus and Priscilla, whom she had with her ex-husband, Mr.Ojo, before their divorce in 2001.

In an interview early this year, the actress had revealed that being a single mum was her biggest challenge.
