Boat owners plying the Calabar/Oron route have cried out over insecurity in the Calabar waters, despite allegedly paying N5,000 daily for security. A boat owner who pleaded not to be named disclosed this to journalists in Calabar while confirming that a boat conveying passengers from Calabar to Oron was hijacked on Monday. According to him, pirate attacks has been occurring in the waters since 2014. He lamented that pirates almost ran them out of business and they have been protesting to draw government’s attention to the matter. An attack, he said, occurred in December last year and one of the abducted passengers allegedly paid N250,000 before regaining freedom. He also disclosed that while the passengers are usually released, the pirates are after the engine of the boats which cost over N2.5 million for a second hand engine. He said pirate attacks in the waters were frequent, and appealed to the government to come to their aid. The Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo said they are not sure about the incident when contacted. “I called our OC (Officer in Charge) Marine and he said that’s what he heard and nobody has come to report to the police. “The union leader in charge is supposed to come and report but nevertheless we are on the matter. “The area is being combed and our men are on ground, nobody has come to complain but we are still on it,” she said.
