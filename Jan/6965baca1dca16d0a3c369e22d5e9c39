Ogun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, on Saturday said the state would witness the completion of projects embarked upon by his administration as well as those left uncompleted by the immediate past administration, particularly which have direct economic impacts on the people. Abiodun reiterated that his administration’s commitment is towards delivering more infrastructural projects in 2022. The governor stated this in his New Year broadcast on Saturday, saying, although the last two years have been most challenging for humanity due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he expressed optimism that Ogun would witness new dawn in 2022. The governor attributed the survival of the people to the indomitable spirit of man to confront and overcome adversities. He declared, “I am convinced the year 2022 will be a much better year for our dear state, and for us as individual citizens”. “The hope for a much better year 2022 is rooted in our faith in God and several achievements that your government, our Administration, has recorded since you entrusted us with your mandate in 2019. The steady progression is verifiable with visible projects across our dear State.” Abiodun said that despite the outbreak of COVID-19, which brought in its wake disruptions and destructions of monumental proportions to the world, his administration was undeterred but committed to the delivery of its electoral promises and the implementation of the ISEYA Agenda. According to him, several projects were initiated and completed but could not be commissioned due to the COVID-19 protocols that restricted the size of social gatherings. Copyright PUNCH.
