Former President Goodluck Jonathan is expected to deliver a keynote address at the Bayelsa education summit scheduled to hold from February 7 to 10, 2022. The state government said the three-day summit in Yenagoa, the state capital, with the theme, ‘Optimising the delivery, performance and sustainability of outcomes in the education sector of Bayelsa State,’ was aimed at repositioning the education sector. The Commissioner for Education, Gentle Emelah, said it had become necessary for the state to shift its focus to technical and vocational education and training, science, technology, engineering and mathematics and other modern approaches at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels. The shift in focus, according to the commissioner, would enable the state government to ensure the provision and sustenance of the quality of education that meets global standards. Emelah further said, “We have contacted and received the acceptance of very important and knowledgeable persons, institutions and organisations to both speak, attend and share useful strategies with the state on the development of our education sector. Notably, Dr Goodluck Jonathan GCFR, former President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, shall present the keynote address.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
