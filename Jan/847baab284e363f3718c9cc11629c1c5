Ahead of the 2023 presidential election, state legislators in all the North Central states have passed a vote of confidence in the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress. The legislators also endorsed Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, for President in 2023. According to a statement, the decisions were reached a one-day meeting of the APC States Legislatures from the six states of the North Central Zone, held in Abuja on Thursday. They encouraged Bello to continue to pursue his ambition, saying he remained the only person that the zone could rally round “for it to be counted in the power equation of the country.” The lawmakers stressed that the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee needed the support and cooperation of all party faithful to reposition the party for better performance and victory in the 2023 polls. According to the convener, the immediate past Speaker of the Niger State House of Assembly, Ahmed Marafa, the meeting was convened to discuss the political future of the zone with respect to what he called the power equation in the country.
