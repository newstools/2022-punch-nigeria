The Federal Medical Center, Yola, in partnership with Manaco Impact Foundation has developed a vaccine reminder App (Paediatric Oncall) designed to promote childhood vaccination. Chief Medical Director of the centre, Prof. Auwal Abubakar, told the News Agency of Nigeria on Saturday that the app would be launched in March. Paediatric Oncall is an informative as well as an interactive platform for doctors and parents offering information on various diseases, vaccines, nutrition, homemade remedies, and even a forum to post one’s queries to a doctor. Abubakar said that work on it had reached an advanced stage, adding that it would be test-run in January. “We are still in the developing stage but we are hoping to launch it by March. “We are thinking of test running before the end of January and perfecting it before March,” he said. Abubakar said the App would be used by mothers of children from zero to 15 months. “It will monitor to know if they take the immunisation at the stated times and serve as a reminder. “Also, it will monitor the growth, if there are problems even the mother will be able to know to report back to the hospital. “If they share the data with the hospital we will also see the pattern because for now, we are using the growth scope developed from other countries,” he said. According to him, the App can also be modified and upgraded to monitor other parameters, including that of the mothers and others with time. (NAN)
