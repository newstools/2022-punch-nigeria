The Primate of the Church of the Lord (Prayer Fellowship), Archbishop Rufus Ositelu, has said that corrupt politicians and individuals with ill-gotten wealth will be exposed in 2022. In his New Year message made available to Sunday PUNCH, Ositelu said, “I wish to congratulate you all for the grace granted you by the Almighty God to see year 2022. I urge you to count your blessings and bless the name of the Lord for his numerous blessings while trusting God for a better year in 2022. “Concerning the divine prophecy for 2022, the Lord revealed that in spite of the current situation of the country, there will be a divine intervention that will turn things around for the betterment of the country and the world in general. “The Lord said that corrupt politicians and renowned private individuals with ill-gotten wealth will be exposed. Similarly, God asked me to warn the youth to desist from fraudulent practices as this will only lead them to jail. In the same vein, those who put their trust in God and serve Him diligently will enjoy protection from the challenges in 2022.” The respected cleric also stated that obedience to the word of God was a prerequisite for God’s protection and blessings. According to him, this is demonstrated through the circumstances surrounding the birth of Jesus Christ . Encouraging Nigerians to imbibe Godly virtues, Ositelu said, “In all we do, we must not hesitate to obey God. For Nigeria to move forward, we should all imbibe virtues of obedience to God and authorities, righteousness (divine lifestyle), patience, endurance, humility, love for one another, peace, kindness, gentleness, faithfulness and self control.”  Copyright PUNCH.
