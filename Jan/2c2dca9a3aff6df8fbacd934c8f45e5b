The Kano State government has lauded telecommunication firm, MTN Nigeria, for its various interventions in the health care sector of the state. MTN through its Foundation had on January 17 handed over one of the six ultra-modern mobile medical vehicles to the Kano State Government to provide access to primary health care services for communities and markets in Kano state. MTN Sales and Distribution Manager in Kano State, Mr Hamza Ibrahim, in a statement on Tuesday, said the firm was delighted to partner with the Kano State Government in ensuring that underserved communities were medically attended to. “This phase of the initiative will be implemented under a Public-Private Partnership model and will involve medical outreaches to markets and under-served communities to support the Kano State Government efforts in improving the well-being of its residents,” he said. The Permanent Secretary, Kano State Ministry of Health, Mrs Amina Musa, “We are happy that the state is among the beneficiaries of the third phase of the Y’ello Doctor initiative. “This intervention will go a long way in supporting the health care delivery system of the state. The intervention is also in-line with the vision and programmes of the administration in bringing health care services to underserved communities through various medical and surgical outreach programmes.” Copyright PUNCH.
