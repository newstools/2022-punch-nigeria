Super Eagles coach Austin Eguavoen says the current team are eager to emulate the class of 2006, who recorded three straight wins during the group stage of the competition. Eguavoen, 56, is the only man to have coached Nigeria to win all three matches in the group phase of the AFCON since the country started participating at this level since 1963. He was head coach when the Eagles defeated Ghana 1-0, Zimbabwe 2-0 and Senegal 2-1 at the Al Masry Stadium, Port Said to sweep the stakes at the 2006 finals. “Finishing with nine points from the group will be good just as we did when I had the opportunity to coach the team in 2006,” Eguavoen said. “I will not take the credit alone. I just coach and give instructions and the players go out there to carry out the instructions. I’m very sure that this group here is ready to emulate that.” In 14 previous matches across three stints, the 1994 AFCON winner and two-time World Cup defender left the field victorious in 12 matches, losing only two – the 1-0 defeat to Ivory Coast in the semi-finals of the 2006 finals and a 2012 AFCON qualifier in Guinea that was embroiled in circumstances of uncertainty, which the team lost by the odd goal.
