American fitness model, Maralee Nichols, has reacted after basketballer Tristan Thompson admitted to fathering her one-month-old son. Nichols’s publicist made this known in a statement to Page Six on Tuesday, stating that the fitness model never doubted the paternity of her child. The publicist said, “There was never any doubt that Tristan Thompson was the father of Maralee Nichols’ baby. “Tristan made numerous false and defamatory statements and declarations about Maralee over the past few months, and she is taking his contrite statement today in the context of all of those statements.” The Sacramento Kings player who also fathered a child with reality TV star, Khloe Kardashian had on Monday publicly admitted to being the father of Maralee’s child. Since December 2021, Thompson had been in a paternity suit with Nichols over the fathering of her son. Despite the ups and downs, Khloe had stuck to Thompson as they both agreed to raise their daughter, True, together. However, with the confirmation that the basketball player was now a father with another woman, Thompson took to his Instagram page on Monday to publicly apologise to Khloe. Copyright PUNCH.
