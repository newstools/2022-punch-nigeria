The Chairman of the Chibok Local Government Area, Borno State, Umar Ibrahim, has confirmed the death of four people during ISWAP attacks on different communities in the council over the weekend. He also announced the abduction of 24 others by the insurgents. Addressing the state Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, during a visit to Chibok, the chairman said the terrorists had intensified attacks on communities in the area due to its proximity to the Sambisa Forest, where the jihadists hide. This was contained in a statement by the governor’s spokesperson, Isa Gusau. Ibrahim, according to the statement, said in addition to the 24 people abducted, three persons were killed by the terrorists. He disclosed that 110 buildings, made up of 73 houses, 33 shops and four churches, were burnt alongside eight vehicles and three tricycles. The governor was said to have commiserated with the affected families and ordered an assessment of the destruction in the council. “We are here in Chibok to commiserate with you, immediate families of our sisters and brothers abducted, as well as four of our brothers killed by the Boko Haram terrorists in these unfortunate incidents. We share your pains and we pray this act will not happen again,” Zulum said in the statement. After meeting the families, the governor interfaced with heads of security agencies and discussed gaps and ways to enhance security in the communities. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
