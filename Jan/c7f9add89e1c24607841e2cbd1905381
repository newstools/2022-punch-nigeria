Nollywood actress, Zainab Balogun-Nwachukwu, has expressed frustration about the harsh climate of Nigeria’s business environment. The Chief Daddy  actress currently runs a hair salon, Wash and Go, with friend and TV presenter, Bolanle Olukanni. Balogun took to her Instagram stories on Tuesday to reveal the numerous problems that besieged her as a Nigerian business owner. She wrote, “Doing business in Nigeria is a horrible experience 99% of the time. If it is not a frustrating landlord, it’s subpar facility companies, NEPA deficiencies or fraudulent government agencies who want to punish you for making an honest living. You’ll dot all your i’s and t’s but it is not always enough.” Balogun further claimed that an educated accountant working with her company resigned because of their refusal to pay bribe to Lagos Inland Revenue service. “Can you imagine?” she continued. “We broke no law. Filing/audit was up to date but she was upset at our principles.” She added that the problem was compounded with the need to satisfy customers no matter the circumstances. “Then you have to make sure your customers don’t feel the burden. they will be pissed. they won’t always understand. Some will even enjoy your misfortunes, yet you have to do it all with a smile on your face and the best customer service. Salute to the Nigerian entrepreneur,” she wrote. Copyright PUNCH.
