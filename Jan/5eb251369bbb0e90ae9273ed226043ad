The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof Isa Pantami, says over 500,000 Nigerians have benefitted from digital skills empowerment programmes organised by the ministry. He said this while speaking as the special guest of honour during a virtual workshop organised by the World Bank on Digital Skills Roadmap on Thursday. This was contained in a statement from the minister’s spokesperson, Uwa Suleiman. It was titled ‘we are championing a paradigm shift that emphasizes skills– Pantami’. The minister was quoted as saying, “we are championing a paradigm shift with emphasis on skills, particularly digital skills over merely having degrees without skills. A Digital Economy cannot be developed in silos and that is why the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy has entered into mutually beneficial partnerships with global technology giants and institutions in order to empower our citizens, with the requisite skills to become employers, rather than employees in the long run”. The statement further read in part, “The minister also disclosed that over 500,000 Nigerians have so far benefitted from digital skills empowerment programmes at various levels, initiated and driven by the Ministry and the parastatals under its purview.
