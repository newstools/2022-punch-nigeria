Vice President Yemi Osinbajo was in Katsina on Sunday evening where he restated the Federal Government’s determination to crush terrorism. He gave the assurance at the palace of the Emir of Katsina, Dr. Adulmumini Usman. Osinbajo was in Katsina on a condolence visit over recent security challenges in the state. He was accompanied to the Emir’s palace by Governor Aminu Masari; his Deputy, Manir Yakubu; and other top government officials. Osinbajo said with the recent strategies put in place by the Federal Government, the fight against terrorism is being taken to the terrorist’s hideouts wherever they are. According to him, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), intentionally labelled bandits, terrorists, adding that the President had directed security operatives to deal decisively with the bandits wherever they are. He sympathised with the Emir and the people of Katsina over recent security challenges in the state, assuring them that the Federal Government is doing everything possible to curb terrorism and other crimes, not only in the state, but across Nigeria. The Emir, in his remarks, lauded the Federal Government and Masari for their efforts in tackling terrorism in the state. He observed that although the scale of attacks by terrorists had declined considerably in the state, there are still pockets of attacks that should be decisively dealt with. The Emir pleaded for more efforts in making the state crime-free and peaceful. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
