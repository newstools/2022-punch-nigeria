Ogun State Government has installed the first monarch in Moriwi Kingdom, Imeko-Afon Local Government Area of the state, 108 years after the community came into existence. The monarch, Oba James Taiwo, is the Alele of Moriwi Kingdom and the first monarch in the community since it was founded in 1914. Speaking at the installation and presentation of staff of office to the monarch, the state governor, Dapo Abiodun, said the traditional ruler would serve as an intermediary between the government and the people. The governor, who was represented by the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Afolabi Afuape, described the monarch’s appointment as a call to serve. He urged him to champion efforts that will further enhance peaceful co-existence with neighbouring towns. Abiodun said the reign of the monarch should create a conducive environment for investors to do business in Moriwi. He said, “Your appointment is a call to serve your people, and as such, you are expected to champion all efforts that will further enhance peaceful co-existence with other neighbouring towns while also cooperating with other royal fathers within Yewaland and indeed, the entire Ogun State, in order to justify the mandate and trust reposed in you by the good people of Moriwi and the Ogun State Government. “Let me inform you that as a Coronet Oba, your domain remains Moriwi. You are not expected to extend your authority beyond Moriwi and you have not been authorised to install Baale over any settlement in your neighbourhood.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
