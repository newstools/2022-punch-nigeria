The immediate past Chairman, Ekiti State Council of Traditional Rulers and the Alawe of Ilawe Ekiti, Oba Adebanji Alabi, has advised politicians across political divides against resort to defaming and blackmailing of prospective aspirants to political offices. Oba Alabi, who said politicians should market themselves and their unique selling points, advised them “to stop using faceless people to blackmail one another.” The monarch gave the advice in a statement by his Media Adviser, Chief Ajibade Olubunmi, titled, ‘Alawe cautions politicians against blackmail and foul play’, in reaction to an alarm by the Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, on Thursday, that some faceless people were plotting to de-market him through a series of unsubstantiated publications over the 2023 presidential bid. The monarch said, “Though Governor Fayemi has not given any indication of contesting any position after his current term of office as the governor of Ekiti, he is well qualified for the highest political office in the country. “Dr Fayemi is not only a two-time governor of Ekiti State, he is the Chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum, whose performance has been described by his colleagues as excellent. And as a Nigerian, he is free to contest the highest political position in the country.” He described Fayemi as “a quintessential politician of note, who will enjoy the support of Nigerians any time he gives the indication of contesting a higher position.” “Moreover, Fayemi has the constitutional rights to vie for the highest position in the country,” the monarch added.
