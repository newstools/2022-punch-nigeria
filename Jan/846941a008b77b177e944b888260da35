Almeria striker Sadiq Umar is relishing the prospect of making his debut at the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Cameroon and believes the Super Eagles have all it takes to reach the final despite missing key players, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The Eagles will be without their top scorer during the qualifiers with five goals, Victor Osimhen, and defender Leon Balogun, who recently returned to training after a long injury layoff. Shehu Abdulahi also pulled out of the tournament due to injury, while Odion Ighalo could miss out following a club and country row. Umar is one of the nine forwards listed by interim coach Austin Eguavoen for the continental showpiece and he says the three-time AFCON winners won’t disappoint their countrymen in Cameroon. “We have been working hard for over a week now and we will take our chances in Cameroon,” Sadiq told PUNCH Sports Extra. “Training has been good and we believe we will not disappoint. “We will fight for the team and make the country proud. Our aim is to go all the way to the final and win it.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
