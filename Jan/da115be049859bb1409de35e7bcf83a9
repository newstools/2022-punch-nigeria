The embattled former head of the Nigeria Police Force’s Intelligence Response Team, Abba Kyari; and a popular socialite, Obinna Iyiegbu, better known as Obi Cubana, were some of the guests that attended the wedding of Maina Alkali, the son of the incumbent Inspector-General of Police, Alkali Baba. The wedding which took place at the palace of the Shehu of Borno, Abubakar El-Kanemi, in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State, on Saturday, was also attended by the governor of the state, Babagana Zulum; and his counterparts from Yobe and Jigawa State—Mai Mala Buni and Badaru Abubakar respectively. Other guests included the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan; a former governor of Borno, Kashim Shettima; Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika; billionaire businessman, Aliko Dangote; Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Tiamin Rice, Aminu Ahmed. Recall that because of his association with an alleged fraudster, Ramon Abass, aka Hushpuppi, and his subsequent indictment by the United States of America’s Federal Bureau of Investigation, Kyari was suspended from office. One of the major criticisms he faced at the time was because of his perceived closeness with certain personalities such as Obi Cubana.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
