Six Information, Communication and Telecommunications schools are to be built by the Universal Basic Education Commission in the six geo-political zones at N3.6 billion. UBEC is also to build one of such schools in the 36 states, with each set to cost N350 million. The schools which will have the capacity to accommodate a large number of students and ICT infrastructure will be known as UBEC Modern Smart Schools. Groundbreaking for one of the schools was performed by UBEC’s Executive Secretary, Dr Hamid Bobboyi, in Hadeja, Jigawa State, at the weekend. Bobboyi explained in a statement that the UBEC Smart School Programme was informed by the lockdown and closure of schools for nearly one year as a result of COVID-19. He added that the concept became necessary to prepare for a situation that could disrupt the teaching and learning process in the future. The Executive Secretary stressed that digital and e-learning platforms provided opportunities for both teachers and learners without the constraint of time and space. According to him, UBEC expects that the deployment of technology for instructional delivery would significantly increase the quality of basic education and learning outcomes. He stated that plans are on to ensure that some of the smart schools were completed “before the end of this year for academic activities.” “It is my expectation that the standard we are jointly setting up would be sustained and improved upon to meet the schools’ objectives,” Bobboyi said. He commended Jigawa State Governor Badaru Abubakar for providing land for the school. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
