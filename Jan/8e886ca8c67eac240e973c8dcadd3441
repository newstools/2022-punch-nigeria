Veteran actress and preacher, Eucharia Anunobi, on Saturday told her fans that being rich was different from being wealthy. She made this known in a video on her Instagram page, where she admonished her followers about reaping what they have sown. The preacher, who goes by the title ‘Apostle’, also gave differences between two words that are usually closely associated. She said, “Having sex is not the same as making love. Hearing is not the same as listening. Being rich is not the same as being wealthy. “You cannot watch pornography all day and expect to be holy . You cannot be a nasty, crude, rude, abusive and violent person unto your partner and you expect them to show you love and respect I! “No, you are going to get a trailer load of disrespect! Because what you give is what you get! You get it?” The preacher is famous for sharing daily words of exhortation on her Instagram page. Anunobi last week stated that people’s social media posts reveal who they truly were. In one of her messages, the preacher had knocked people who spend lavishly for parties, stating that they waste God’s blessings when they buy ‘aso ebi‘. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
