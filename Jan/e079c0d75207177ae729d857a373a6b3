Fifty-three of the 60 youths arrested for their involvement in a gang fight that led to the killing of a policeman and a trader in Minna have been remanded in the Borgu Local Government Area Correctional Centre on the orders of a Minna Magistrate Court One in the state. The suspects were charged with culpable homicide, conspiracy, robbery and being in procession of dangerous weapons among others at the court on Thursday. Before they were remanded, the Prosecuting Police Officer, Inspector Ahmed Saidu, told the court that the offence is criminal in nature and cannot be tried by the magistrate. He appealed to the court to adjourn the case to enable the police to forward the case file to the Niger State Ministry for Justice for legal advice on the matter. The Magistrate, Nasir Mu’azu, after examining the nature of the case, adjourned it to the 21st of February for further hearing. He directed the police to immediately forward the case file to the ministry for Justice for proper prosecution. The suspects who were arrested on two different raids were arraigned on a 10-count charge. Their offences violated various sections of the penal code law of the country.
