Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Tuesday in Kano, described the late Premier of the Northern region, Sir Ahmadu Bello, Sardauna of Sokoto, as an exemplary leader, whose sterling leadership qualities would remain indelible in the political history of Nigeria. Osinbajo made the remark at special lecture organised by the Sardauna Memorial Foundation with the theme, “Reviving the Northern traditional institutions, imperatives on peace and security in the North.” He said, “His love for talakawa, humility, punctuality and generous contributions to mankind is highly commendable. “The emirate system in Northern Nigeria was a well structured institution, which was the handiwork and legacy of Sardauna of Sokoto. “The traditional institutions were enjoying the confidence of the people and were held in the highest esteem because they were responsible to the yearnings of their people.” According to him, the issue of good governance and leadership in a democratic dispensation entails a commitment and doggedness of a leader, who can at all times strive to safeguard at all cost. On the wave of insecurity rocking the northern part of the country, the Vice President promised that the Federal Government is working round the clock to ensure that all the perpetrators were speedily prosecuted in line with the laws of the country.
