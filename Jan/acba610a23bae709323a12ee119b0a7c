A northern group under the auspices of Federation of Northern Organisation has thrown its weights behind Mr Mazi Samuel Iheanyichukwu Ohuabunwa, former President, Pharmaceutical Society Of Nigeria, to run for presidency in 2023. Abdullahi Abdullahi, spokesman of the group, in a statement, said, “Northen youths call for Mr Mazi Samuel Iheanyichukwu Ohuabunwa, former President, Pharmaceutical Society Of Nigeria to run for the presidency in 2023.” The group noted that on account of justice and national cohession, it is very important that the People’s Democratic Party zone their presidential ticket to South East, and a professional and seasonal administration should spear head the party. According to them, Ohuabunwa should be considered for such privilege, saying that it was long overdue for the people of South-East to be given the opportunity. He explained that the leadership of northern youths are very much aware of the decision and politicking of the opposition party to allow northern Nigeria produce the next presidential candidate, lamenting that it was totally unjust and inhuman on the people of South Eastern Nigeria. The group stated, “We speak on the authority of one Nigeria that equity and justice must privail to aid national unity in our country.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
