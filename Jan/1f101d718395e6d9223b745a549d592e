The Captain Elechi Amadi Polytechnic, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, has announced the suspension of one of its lecturers, Tamunotonye Solomon, for three months over allegations of sexual harassment of female students. The lecturer and a 200-level female student had exchanged words in the media over the development. While the students claimed that the lecturer accused her of stealing his N250,000 after she refused his marriage proposal, the lecturer described the allegation as a blackmail, saying he arrested the former because she stole his money and some office property. But the management of the polytechnic, in a statement signed by the Registrar, Chris Woke, expressed annoyance with the development and dissociated itself from the alleged conduct of the lecturer. The statement read in part, “The management of the Captain Elechi Amadi Polytechnic, Rumuola, Port Harcourt, is irked by the report in certain sections of the media and disassociates itself completely from the alleged conduct of its staff member, Mr Tamunotonye Zoe Solomon. “The management of the Captain Elechi Amadi Polytechnic, Rumuola, Port Harcourt, has therefore suspended Mr Tamunotonye Zoe Solomon for three months with effect from January 10, 2022 in connection with allegations of harassment and exploitation of a female student and other acts of misconduct prejudicial to the good name of the polytechnic.
