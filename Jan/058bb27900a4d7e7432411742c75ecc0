Nigerian award-winning singer, David Adeleke, aka Davido, has thrown shade at his cousin, Bamidele Adeleke, for declaring his interest to run in the 2022 Osun State governorship election. The Aye crooner, on his Twitter page on Tuesday, shared a picture of his cousin, where the latter posed with a provisional clearance certificate for the Osun State governorship election under the Peoples Democratic Party. Davido noted that his cousin struggled to graduate with a Second Class (Lower Division) and has not succeeded in building “one single thing in his life on his own.” The singer wrote, “Wonderful! I finished university with a 2:1. But it’s now cousin Dele who struggled to even get a 2:2 that is now forming ‘intellectual’. “Intellectual that has not succeeded in building one single thing in his life on his own. This life! Osun, beware of fakes!(sic)” It was earlier reported that Davido’s uncle, Senator Ademola Adeleke, last month submitted his governorship nomination form at the PDP office, as he also made his governorship ambition known ahead of the Osun State election. Davido, however, had always shown public support for his uncle’s governorship ambition. Responding to Davido’s latest tweet against his cousin, the senator told Davido, “Don’t worry Nephew, God got us.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
