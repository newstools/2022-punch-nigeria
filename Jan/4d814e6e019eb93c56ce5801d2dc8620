Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the Strides Political Group has applauded Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State for promising a level-playing field to all aspirants in the forthcoming Peoples Democratic Party’s primaries. The coordinator of the group, Mr. Festus Igherebuo, stated this on Saturday in an interview with our correspondent on the preparation for the party’s primaries. He said, “Governor Okowa has promised a level-playing field for all the aspirants and we hope that he will uphold his promise. “We the political group in the PDP will continue to support and be loyal to the party and the governor in making sure that the party emerges victorious during the general elections. “All we are begging the state Chairman of the party, Kingsley Esiso, and other committee of the party for is to ensure stability in the party.” Igherebuo said the group was able to woo over 50 members of the All Progressives Congress in Okwumagba and Edjeba wards to the PDP. He noted that victory for the PDP in Delta State was already settled as the state belonged to the party, adding that the party was putting everything in place to wrestle power from the APC at the centre. The coordinator commended Okowa for leading the party in the right direction, stressing that the state had witnessed tremendous infrastructural development under his administration.  Copyright PUNCH.
