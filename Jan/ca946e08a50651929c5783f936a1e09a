Three policemen and two local vigilance group members have been killed by gunmen in Kwanan Dutse, Mariga Local Government Area of the Niger State. The joint security task force members were said to have been on their way back from a routine patrol when they were ambushed by the gunmen on Monday at about 4.00pm. Our correspondent gathered that on their way back around Kwanan Dutse, their patrol team ran into a roadblock mounted by the gunmen. There was said to have been an exchange of gunfire between the gunmen and the Joint Security TaskForce which led to the killing of three policemen and two local vigilantes while others sustained various degrees of injury. Our source also disclosed that a number of the gunmen were killed in the gun battle but as it is a practice for the gunmen, they evacuated the bodies of their colleagues on their motorcycles. It was also revealed that there was an attack on the same road on Sunday but the joint security task force was able to neutralise it. The gunmen were said to have only been able to escape with cattle they rustled from villages around. As of the time of filing this report, the Public Relations Officer of the state police command had not responded to a message sent to him on the incident nor had the command issued a statement on the attack which occurred on Monday. This recent attack is coming about three days after 28 people were killed in the Mashegu Kontagora axis of the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
