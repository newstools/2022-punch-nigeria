The Ogun State Commissioner for Rural Development, Taiwo Oludotun, has begged workers in the state to bear with the administration of Governor Dapo Abiodun. Oludotun said the state’s allocation from the Federation Account was being highly augmented to pay its bills. The commissioner said this on Tuesday when the management and staff of the ministry gathered in a prayer session to usher in the New Year. He urged the management and workers of the ministry to be more committed to their duties and display loyalty to the administration. According to him, the prayer session is to put God first as that is one of the secrets of success in life. The commissioner advised them to work harder and diligently in their respective areas of specialisation to help the government actualise its ISEYA agenda to spur more development. Oludotun urged the workers to shun frivolous activities that could hinder them from performing their duties effectively, adding that their welfare would always be given priority. Copyright PUNCH.
