Nigerian Gospel artiste, Sammie Okposo, has returned to social media after a brief absence, on Monday. Okposo who returned to social media set his Instagram page @SammieOkposo, to private. It was earlier reported by The PUNCH that Okposo received online backlashes last week Tuesday, when he publicly confessed to cheating on his wife, with a US-based Nigerian woman. In the heat of the public conversation on the alleged infidelity, he removed himself from public spaces by deactivating his social media platforms on Wednesday. However, checks by our correspondent showed that the Wellu Wellu master, as he is fondly called, have returned to Instagram. See screenshot below: Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
