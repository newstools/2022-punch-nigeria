American singer, Tremaine Neverson, professionally known as Trey Songz, has reacted to the rape allegations made by Basketball star, Dylan Gonzalez. Gonzalez had taken to her Instagram page on Tuesday to accuse Trey Songz of raping her, adding that she was going through post-traumatic stress disorder. This comes as the singer was under investigation for a separate case of sexual assault in Vegas. She said, “With what seems like endlessly reoccurring news of the alleged sexual assaults committed by Trey Songz, I am forced to repeatedly relive in my mind, and suffer anew, the long-suppressed horror and unbearable PTSD of my rape by his very hands at a well known Las Vegas Hotel. “I want to send my love, strength, and hope to all who are victims of sexual assault and its fatal nature. You are not alone. “I stand with you and encourage all those who have suffered abuse to speak out and come forward. Suppression of our voices only emboldens our oppressors, and you cannot heal what you do not reveal. “At this time, I humbly request my privacy, consideration, and compassion while I fully commit to pursue the best course of action and all of my legal options.” A close source, however, told TMZ that the incident happened several years ago. However, Trey Songz has reacted to the claim via a representative who spoke to TMZ concerning the matter. “Trey and his team are confident in the legal process and that there will be an abundance of exonerating information to come over the next few weeks,” the rep said.
