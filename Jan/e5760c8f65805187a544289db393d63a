A 37-year-old insurance executive, Kafayat Adewale, on Thursday won a new Kia Rio car in the ongoing Globacom Joy Unlimited Extravaganza promo. According to a statement, the prize presentation was held at Cele-Okota, Lagos. The statement quoted the winner as saying that, “This is a unique way to start 2022. For the past five days, I have not been myself. “It is not that I don’t have a car but if anyone had predicted in December that I will have a new car in January, I wouldn’t have believed. “Initially, I was sceptical when I got a call from Glo but by the time the second call came in and they all sounded very professional coupled with the fact that I visited the Gloworld near Cele Bus Stop where I did the verification and   I saw the car parked there, I became convinced. “Today I have received the car key and I am now a Glo ambassador. I will continue to convince all Nigerians to join the Glo network. God bless Glo.” According to the statement, 13 new Kia Rio cars have been won so far in the promo with thousands of home appliances which also went to lucky subscribers. At the Cele-Okota, Lagos event, 66 other winners won home appliances including 23 television sets, 20 refrigerators and 23 power generating sets.
