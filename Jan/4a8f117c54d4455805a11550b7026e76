Governor Bello Mattawale of Zamfara State has described the postponement of the visit of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to the state as something destined by God. Matawalle said, “As man proposes, God disposes. I am sadly announcing that President Muhammadu Buhari has postponed his condolence visit to Zamfara due to the sharp drop in weather conditions. “With poor visibility, the President could not make it to Zamfara. “As Muslims, we accepted this as something destined by Allah. “The safety of our President is greater than our interest. “However, I have spoken with the President who assured me of rescheduling the visit soon.” Copyright PUNCH.
