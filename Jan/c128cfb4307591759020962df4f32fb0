Super Eagles striker, Taiwo Awoniyi, says they will not underestimate any opponent in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations group but adds that an opening win against Egypt is important to set the team on the right path. The three-time African champions are pooled in Group D alongside Egypt, Sudan and Guinea-Bissau. Nigeria face the Pharaohs in their first game of the 2021 AFCON in Cameroon at the Stade Omnisport Roumdé Adjia on Tuesday. Speaking ahead of the crucial game, Awoniyi, who plays for Union Berlin in Germany, admitted that no country in their group was a pushover. “Looking at our group, I think every country is there for the trophy because this is not a club marathon league,” Awoniyi told NFF media team. “This is a tournament that you know every game counts and I believe everyone is here for serious business. “This is not a group where we just want to think we are going there to beat everyone because I think the other countries will also have the same belief. “I think it is all about how we set in as a country and how we get ourselves ready for the games and it all starts with our first game, which is against Egypt. From the first game, we will know what step to take in the next games, but I think winning the first game is very important.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
