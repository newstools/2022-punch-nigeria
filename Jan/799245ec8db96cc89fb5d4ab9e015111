Following internal controversies between the governors of the All Progressives Congress and the Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee over the party’s national convention, the Director General of the Progressive Governors’ Forum has resigned. The PUNCH learnt that although the APC Governors met on Sunday to discuss the National Convention, they also deliberated whether or not the DG should be forced to resign. According to a party source, while some of the governors opposed Lukman’s resignation, others insisted that he should be shown the door. When our correspondent tried to reach out to Lukman, calls and a text message went unanswered. Sunday’s meeting was attended by the Governors of Yobe, Mai Mala Buni; Borno, Babagana Zulum; Jigawa, Muhammad Abubakar; Ondo, Rotimi Akeredolu; Niger, Abubakar Bello; Kaduna, Nasir El-Rufai; Ekiti, Kayode Fayemi; Kogi, Yahaya Bello; Ogun, Dapo Abiodun; Zamfara, Bello Matawalle; Ebonyi, Dave Umahi; Osun, Gboyega Oyetola; Lagos, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; Plateau, Simon Lalong; Imo, Hope Uzondinma; Nasarrawa, Abdullahi Sule, Cross River, Ben Ayade; Kwara, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, Kano, Abdullahi Ganduje; and Deputy Governor of Anambra State, Nkem Okeke.
