On whether oil workers would support the probe by the National Assembly as touching petrol consumption in Nigeria, the General Secretary, PENGASSAN, Lumumba Okugbawa, told our correspondent that the association would back whatever would bring transparency in the petrol supply business. He said, “Any action that will help bring transparency in the oil and gas (sector) will be a welcome development. “We believe that if smuggling, for example, is reduced to the barest minimum, the figures touted today as daily consumption will be significantly low.” Copyright PUNCH.
