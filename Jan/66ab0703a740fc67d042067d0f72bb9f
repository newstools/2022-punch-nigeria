Aston Villa winger Bertrand Traore has tested positive for Covid-19 while on international duty with Burkina Faso. Traore is currently in Cameroon representing his nation at the Africa Cup of Nations, but his tournament could now be over. Burkina Faso head coach Kamou Malo, who himself has only just recovered from the illness, confirmed the result of Traore’s test this afternoon. The West Africans’ second group game is due to take place on Thursday against Cape Verde after they lost the opening game of the tournament to hosts Cameroon. Burkina Faso took the lead through Gustavo Sangare, but lost 2-1 after Vincent Aboubakar scored two penalties before half-time
