Over 50 children were said to have been trapped as one storey belonging to Salvation Ministries collapsed during evening service on Tuesday at Okpanam, Oshinili North local government area of Delta state. PUNCH Metro gathered that the incident which occured around 5pm especially at the children section of the church trapped over 50 kids during bible studies. It was learnt that the church building, which has stayed for over 10 years was initially designed as a plaza before the church occupied the upper chamber of the one storey building. One of the church members simply identified as Grace Ibe, stated that the service was ongoing when the building collapsed with a thunderous noise. “We were clapping and praying when suddenly we heard the cracking and the building swallowed the children section with the children,” she said. She said the church is currently observing its new year 21 day fasting but members of the ill-fated church came to break the fasting with a communion service. Men of the Delta State Emergency Management Agency, fire service and the state police command formed the rescue team as trapped chilrdren were crying under the debris of the collasped building.
