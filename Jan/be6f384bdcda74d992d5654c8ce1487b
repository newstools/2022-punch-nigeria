Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Kalu, has said he’s being pressured to declare his intention to run for the Presidency and pay a visit to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), as recently done by two of his colleagues in the ruling All Progressives Congress. The PUNCH reported that a chieftain of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, visited Buhari at the State House in Abuja, on Monday. Fielding questions from State House correspondents, Tinubu stated that he informed Buhari of his intention to run in the 2023 presidential election. The Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, on Tuesday, also paid a visit to the President. Shortly after their meeting, the Governor said he briefed Buhari of his intentions to contest for the 2023 APC presidential ticket. Kalu, a former governor of Abia State, who is believed to be nursing ambition to succeed Buhari, in a statement he signed on Wednesday, said he’s waiting to see if the APC will zone the Presidency to the South. He said this will determine if he will also pay a visit to the President. According to him, “Fellow Nigerians. I have been inundated with pressured requests to also declare my intention to run for the Presidency of our dear country and visit Mr President following visits by my other brothers to Mr President yesterday.” He added, “As soon as the party zones the Presidency and southern Nigeria is zoned to produce the presidential candidate of our party, my train which is already steaming shall take off with a visit to Aso Rock Villa and brief Mr President of our collective decision. May God bless you all.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
