The Chairman of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, SAN, has urged the 246 recruits of the agency to help rid the nation of all acts of corruption, and shun corrupt practices, on Tuesday. He made this statement at the passing out parade of the new officers who had spent six weeks for a course at the Nigerian Security and Civil Defense training academy in Suaka, Abuja. Oransanye said, “You have the herculean task of ridding Nigeria of the menace of corruption. This board and management have zero tolerance for corruption, indiscipline, and other forms of official malfeasance. “You must strive to always live above board. Any act of disloyalty to the Commission will not be tolerated and the person will be shown the way out.” The ICPC boss stressed that the recruitment of 246 staff members of the agency, comprising of senior and junior cadres were selected out of 400,000 applicants. He added that the new officers would bolster the agency efforts in carrying out its duties in tackling corruption in Nigeria headlong. “Consider yourself lucky to have been selected by the Commission out of the over 400,000 that applied for the job. “Your conduct must be above board because the ICPC mandate demands it. Integrity and discipline are essential character traits you must have to excel in your career. You must make integrity and honesty your watchword.” Meanwhile, the Commandant-General of NSCDC, Dr Ahmed Audi, who was represented by the Deputy Commandant, Nnamdi Nwenyi, noted that the new staff had been rigorously trained and equipped to function as anti-corruption officers.
