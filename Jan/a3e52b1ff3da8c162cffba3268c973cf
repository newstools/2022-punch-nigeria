ABOUT 600 women groups on Tuesday gathered in Abuja in support of the presidential ambition of Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State in the 2023 elections. The groups came from the six geo-political zones, non-governmental organisations, civil society organisations, religious and professional bodies. The women, under the aegis of Women United for Yahaya Bello, after their solidarity walk, tagged, ‘One million Women March for Yahaya Bello’, maintained that they were ready to put their weight behind Bello and prove that the era of what they described as “bread and butter politics’’ was over in Nigeria. The President of the National Association of Women Entrepreneurs, Vera Ndanusa, said the mammoth crowd that participated in the march was evidence that “whenever you empower a woman, you reap the benefits many times over”. According to her, women empowerment should be top priority for the Nigerian government as a whole. Ace Nollywood actress, Binta Ayo-Mogaji, who led many other stars, including Ayo Adesanya, Dupe Jaiyesinmi, Rose Odika, Lanre Hassan (Mama Awero) and Madam Kofo, among many others to the event, referred to the commendation by the Vice President of Liberia, Jewel Taylor. The Global President, WUYABEL, Dr Hannatu Adeeko, said she was fascinated by the giant strides of the Kogi governor in his state, saying he had surpassed the prescribed quota for women globally. Adeeko, a consultant physician, who flew into Nigeria from the United States for the march, said the state was working based on the fact that women held strategic positions in Bello’s cabinet.
