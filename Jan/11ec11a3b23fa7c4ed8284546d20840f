The Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees, Edo State chapter, has accused Governor Godwin Obaseki of constitutional crime against the councils in the state. The state Chairman of the union, Mr Lazarus Adorolo, who stated this on Friday, alleged that the governor had hijacked the functions of the local governments and also ripping off the councils. The NULGE President stated that this abnormal situation had placed the council in a difficult position to effectively discharge its duty to the people at the grassroots. He said, “We cannot impact of the lives of the citizens at the grassroots because the state has hijacked our sources of revenue and yet it is the same state government that comes out to the public that local governments are not living up to their responsibilities. “Local governments can only work to the benefit of the people if the issue of 1999 Constitution is looked into, which states that councils must be autonomous. “It is sad that the Chief Accounting Officers of councils are not taken into account whenever monies that come to local governments are being shared. “The councils do not get the 10 per cent of the Internally Generated Revenue that the state is supposed to add to what comes from the federation account. “As we speak, the councils are being owed between five to 16 and half months salaries arrears, including deductions not remitted amounting to over N5bn.”  Copyright PUNCH.
