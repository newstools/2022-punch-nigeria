The Federal Government has approved the appointment of Dr Ogechi Paschal-Ejiogu to the board of directors of the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority. A statement on Thursday said she replaced Mr Ike Chioke, the former appointee for the South-East region, who, following his appointment in 2021, had requested to be relieved of board duty at the NSIA as his firm was appointed to support government in another role. According to the statement, Paschal-Ejiogu brings nearly two decades of cognate experience spanning the social services and healthcare industry to the board of NSIA. It said, “A doctoral-level academic, she possesses in-depth knowledge of complex economic concepts, and is adept at applying theories and ideas to real-world situations. “She also possesses a strong understanding of business finance, econometric modeling, data analysis, planning, and interpretation and has, over the last two decades, contributed significantly to the social services and healthcare industry both in Nigeria and in the United States of America.” Copyright PUNCH.
