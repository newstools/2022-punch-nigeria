Members of the Olubadan-in-Council have agreed to withdrawal the case they instituted over their rights to wear beaded crowns. The administration of late Senator Abiola Ajimobi had elevated the High Chiefs to Obas but the Osi Olubadan, Senator Rashidi Ladoja, refused to be elevated to an Oba. Ladoja went to court and the case was ruled in his favour. The case went to Court of Appeal and a consent judgment was given when Governor Seyi Makinde assumed office. The High Chiefs instituted a case in court to challenge the consent judgment nullifying the elevation granted them. A former Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in the state, Michael Lana, in a petition to Governor Seyi Makinde, said the Otun Olubadan, Senator Lekan Balogun, who is the next in line to the throne, should not be ratified  unless the pending case is withdrawn or determined. He argued that Balogun, already promoted to the position of an oba, could not be elevated to the Olubadan’s throne. Makinde had last Saturday held a meeting with the chiefs including Ladoja and they unanimously agreed to resolve the controversies surrounding the chieftaincy. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
