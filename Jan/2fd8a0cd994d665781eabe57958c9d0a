Grammy award-winning singer, Damini Ogulu, professionally known as Burna Boy, has called for the urgent end to soot emission in Rivers State. The singer, who is an indigene of the state, shared pictures that showed blackened clouds and people affected by soot. In a series of Instagram story posts, the singer wrote, “Dark clouds over my city. What is the way forward? #Stopthesootinportharcourt This is what bright sunny days look for my people right now.” This comes few days after the state Governor, Nyesom Wike, charged the state Commissioner of Police to collaborate with other security agencies, council chairmen and traditional rulers to fish out all those involved in illegal bunkering and artisanal refining for prosecution. The governor accused those engaged in the illicit acts of being responsible for the environmental pollution endangering the health of residents of the state. Wike declared that the state government had resolved to tackle those involved in crude oil theft and refining once and for all. He stated that the government was willing to provide the police and other security agencies all that was required to dislodge and end the activities of artisanal refiners in Rivers State.
