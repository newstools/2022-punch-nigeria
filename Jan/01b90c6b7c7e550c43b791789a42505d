Music producer, Samuel Oguachuba, popularly known as Samklef, has made an open call for new artistes whom he’d like to mentor in 2022. The sound maker took to his Instagram handle on Saturday to make the call, as he promised up-and-coming artistes that he’d promote them on his social media page. Samklef asked his over 720,000 followers on Instagram to tag up-and-coming artistes on his post so that he could support them in his “own little way.” He wrote, “Tag any dope upcoming (sic) artiste you know today. I want to mentor someone this year, and support in my own little way. If I feel your vibe, I will post you on my story.” This is not the first time that Nigerian entertainers would openly call for new artistes. Nigerian songstress, Simisola Kosoko, also known as Simi, also made the same call on Thursday. However, the singer complained about the social media pages of new artistes and asked them to market themselves properly. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
