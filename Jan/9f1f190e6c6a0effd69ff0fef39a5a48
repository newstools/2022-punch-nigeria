An early morning fire has razed shops and stalls in Nguru Central Market in the Nguru Local Government Area of Yobe State, destroying goods and property worth millions of naira. The fire broke out on Saturday, shortly after the traders restocked their shops with goods delivered by train from Kano. The Information Officer of Nguru LGA, Audu Yaro, said over 300 shops were razed by the fire. He said, “There was a fire incident in the Nguru Central Market around 1.30am on Saturday. It burnt down over 300 shops belonging to marketers who specialise in wholesales. “These dealers worked late into the night on Friday as they restocked their shops with goods delivered to them by train from Kano. You know there is a rail track that terminates at Nguru town from Kano, so these dealers often transport their goods by train from Kano. “Their goods arrived on Friday evening, about the time they were to close business for the day, but they had to stay back to offload the goods into their various stalls after which they left very late in the night, say about 12 midnight.” Yaro stated that the cause of the fire had yet to be ascertained. “We don’t know how the fire came about; it burnt down more than half of the stores in the modern market. “As of 5pm (Saturday), fire service is still struggling to put out the fire to show you the enormous damage to the market,” he added.
