The Global Initiatives for Anambra Needs has urged the incoming governor of Anambra State, Prof Charles Soludo, to address the multiple abandoned federal projects in the state. Speaking in Awka on Sunday, the Director-General, GIAN, Mr Amah Amaonye, said the people of the state were in high expectations that Soludo would tackle the issue of abandoned projects immediately he assumes office. He expressed confidence that Soludo’s influence, scorecards and performance in various positions he served, would make him deliver on his campaign promises. He said, “No problem should be seen to be unaddressed or unattended. We are aware that a major problem of
the state is the neglect of federal projects. Therefore, a fast, potent solution must be advanced to this problem.which has left the state with many dilapidated roads and poor accessibility. “This is causing difficulty and logjam never seen before on daily basis for our people travelling in the state both on the Niger Bridge at Asaba end and the Enugu end, where the roads are in a state of total neglect. “There should be a collaborative efforts among the states, involving federal and international intervention, to proffer solution to this problem.” He urged the incoming administration not to be distracted but remain focused and formulate policies that would directly impact on the people at the grassroots. “At GIAN, our belief is that the primary responsibility of every government is to commit its energy and resources to continuously look for the problems of its citizens and to also frantically solve them,” he added.
