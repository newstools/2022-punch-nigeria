Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, on Sunday reiterated his administration’s efforts to fight criminals and kidnappers in the state. The governor, who spoke at the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Hope of Glory Parish, Nyiman in Makurdi, the state capital, vowed that tough times awaits any criminal operating in the state. “Hardened criminals, who terrorised the state in the past have not found it funny but this administration, with the combined efforts of security agencies, will not surrender the state to criminals,” the governor said. The governor, who reiterated the determination of his administration to do all that is necessary to ensure peace in the state, charged Christians to listen to God and walk with Him to order their steps. He reiterated his resolve to allow God direct and work through him while urging believers to apply faith with works in all they do. In his sermon, Pastor Moses Adagba who spoke on the topic,  “Wonders of His Presence,” described God as God of Wonders Who does things without anyone’s permission. He explained that, “God’s presence means knowing God and God knowing you. If one dwells in the presence of God, whatever he says will surely come to pass.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
