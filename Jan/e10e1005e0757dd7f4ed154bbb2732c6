The Chairman, Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission, Prof Bolaji Owasanoye, SAN, has warned the Gefen Group, the developer handling the ICPC Multi-purpose Cooperative Housing Estate against substandard and poor execution of the project valued at N1.176 billion. He gave the warning in Abuja during the official groundbreaking ceremony of the estate, which was named Professor Bolaji Owasanoye Housing Estate, and located in Kagini village, Federal Capital Territory. Owasanoye, who spoke against cutting corners, advised the developer to ensure that only the best standard was delivered to the commission staff. According to a statement on Sunday by the ICPC spokesperson, Azuka Ogugua, the anti-graft agency’s boss encouraged the cooperative to be vigilant by getting experts to supervise the work as the construction progresses. The statement titled, ‘ICPC cooperative launches housing estate,’ read, “The ICPC boss also admonished Infinity Trust Mortgage Bank, the primary mortgage for the housing estate to always play by the rules, saying that ICPC was not an agency to play with.” The project, which covers a total of 1.36 hectares of land, was designed to accommodate 32 units of 2-bedroom flats, 32 units of 3-bedroom flats and 16 units of 4-bedroom flats making a total of 80 units of flats. The Cooperative President, Joshua Wakili, stated that the Kagini Housing Estate project was conceived towards “covering the housing deficit faced by public servants and the residents of Abuja which is one of the cardinal aspirations of the current President of our nation.” Copyright PUNCH.
