Super Eagles defender, Olisa Ndah, says he is ready to represent the country to the best of his abilities any time he is called upon by interim head coach, Austin Eguavoen. The Orlando Pirates defender was a surprise inclusion in Eguavoen’s final 28-man list for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon ahead of Hoffenheim defender, Kevin Akpoguma. Although he is new to the mainstream Eagles, the defender was a mainstay in the home-based team during his spell with Nigeria Professional Football League side, Akwa United. Ndah was listed in the squad against Egypt on Tuesday but was an unused substitute. The defender has stated that he is ready for action and to defend the country’s colours when called upon. “I’m ready and prepared to play any time I’m called upon,” Ndah said after the team training on Wednesday. “It is something I’ve been working on and it’s what I’ve dreamed of. I believe in myself, I believe in my abilities, I have great people around me and it’s not going to be difficult for me.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
