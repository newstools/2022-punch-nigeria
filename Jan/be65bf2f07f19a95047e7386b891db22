The leader of the Niger Delta Peoples Salvation Force, Asari Dokubo, has faulted the Indigenous People of Biafra and its leader Nnamdi Kanu for saying that he was behind the reported extradition of its leader from Kenya. He further tackled the group for the constant closure of businesses in the South-East region as a result of the sit-at-home order. During a Facebook live on Sunday, Dokubo said, “IPOB said I was the one that sold them out, that I betrayed them, am not the one who said it. They are also the ones that said I betrayed their leader in Kenya. “I don’t know where Nnamdi Kanu was living, I don’t know where he took off for. They said I was the person who gave him up. I now said I was the person, the next thing they said was Asari Dokubo was the person. Look at these idiots, what are you going to do to me? “IPOB was presented as a platform for reconciliation, but today it is not fighting for Biafra. Today, schools, businesses have been closed down. “If people sit at home, it is their choice that they are afraid of you people, it is not because you people are powerful. They don’t know you people are nothing. “People are afraid of being killed that’s why they’ve continued to sit at home, not because they love Nnamdi Kanu. If there is adequate security by the government, why is there no sit-at-home in Port Harcourt? Calabar? Uyo? It is because the government of these places are saying don’t ever come here. “Very soon Igbos will come out and say it is okay. Our old women are starving they can’t go to the farm, markets. At Onitsha market, people are afraid of doing businesses because they are scared of being killed.”
