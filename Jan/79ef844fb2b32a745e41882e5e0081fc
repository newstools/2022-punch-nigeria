No fewer than 284 Nigerians were either killed or abducted in various attacks across the country in the first week of the year. A breakdown of the figure shows that 220 persons were killed and 64 kidnapped between January 1 and 7, according to media reports. Most of the killings and abductions happened in the northern part of the country. On January 1, bandits killed one and abducted 12 persons in Kaduna, while the wife and daughters of a lecturer in Zamfara State were also abducted on New Year Day. On January 4, gunmen killed three in Plateau State and a bride-to-be was also abducted in the state on the same day. Bandits killed nine villagers in Kaduna and one in Zaria at an IRT operative’s residence on January 5. On January 6, two persons were killed, while three Chinese expatriates were abducted in Niger State. Gunmen also killed one person in Anambra State on the same day. On January 7, bandits killed two passengers and abducted 40 others in Taraba State, while five persons were abducted in the Federal Capital Territory. On the same day, 200 people were killed and many were declared missing when bandits invaded some Zamfara communities. A security expert, Nnamdi Chife, who described the situation as unfortunate, called for improved intelligence to combat banditry and other forms of insecurity in the country. He said, “This is very unfortunate. There is a need for the security services to be reinvigorated with new intelligence assets to combat these types of asymmetric crimes. It’s not enough to have manpower; if we do not have a comprehensive intelligence and security approach to tackling kidnapping and banditry, then we may never end the menace.” Copyright PUNCH.
