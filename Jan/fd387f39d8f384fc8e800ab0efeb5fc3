The Akwa Ibom State Police Command said it has authorised the conduct of an autopsy to determine the cause of the death of one Ernest Akpan in a hotel at Ikot Udoma in the Eket Local Government Area of the state. Akpan was said to have been murdered in mysterious circumstances at the hotel at an end of the year party alongside his friends. The command spokesman, Odiko Macdon, while fielding questions from journalists on Tuesday, explained that the autopsy would determine the cause of death and that the police would also study the closed circuit television gadget that was tampered with by yet to-be-identified persons. Macdon said investigation had commenced to determine the cause of the mysterious death, adding that the Commissioner of Police, Andrew Amiengheme, had ordered that the matter be transferred to the state police command headquarters at Ikot Akpanabia, Uyo. “Yes we are aware of the incident. Investigation is ongoing and I think in no distant time, the killers will be unveiled,” Macdon assured. Our correspondent reports that the commencement of the autopsy followed pressure mounted by the deceased’s family, who obtained the CCTV footage of activities at the hotel on the day of the incident. There had been reports that Akpan drowned in the hotel’s swimming pool following the discovery of his floating corpse, but the confusion trailing the death deepened with the tampering with the CCTV footage from around 4.15am till 5.58am.
