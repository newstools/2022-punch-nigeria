Four persons, including a mechanic, his pregnant wife and a twin apprentice were on Thursday abducted by suspected gunmen along Obo Ayegunle/Osi road in Ekiti Local Government area of Kwara State. Relatives gave the names of the victims as Sunday Balogun, a mechanic, his pregnant wife, Mary, his apprentice Taiye and his twin brother, Kehinde. The victims were said to be travelling from Obbo Ayegunle to Osi when their vehicle was waylaid by the kidnappers in the middle of the 12 kilometre road. According to Mrs Laoye Seyifunmi, a close relative of the mechanic, the kidnappers abandoned Sunday’s vehicle at the roadside after ordering the victims to the bush. Another close family source said that the kidnappers have contacted the family demanding N10m ransom. “They have contacted the family demanding N10m ransom. We have been able to negotiate it to N4m. “Although the family and community have been able to gather N2m, they rejected it and directed that a Toyota Sienna bus in his workshop should be sold to pay the ransom.” Efforts to get police confirmation of the incident on Thursday night proved abortive.
