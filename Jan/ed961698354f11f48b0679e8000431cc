A Peoples Democratic Party chieftain in Ekiti State, Pastor Yemi Olayinka, on Sunday, urged the Iyorchia Ayu-led PDP National Working Committee to rescue the party in the state from jeopardy by conducting the January 26 governorship primary with only the super delegates. Olayinka said using the controversial executives and the ad hoc delegates in the state for the primary given the ongoing court case could spell doom for the party and even throw up fresh litigations. He argued that the use of only super delegates would save the party from a post-primary crisis. The PDP chief, who spoke with journalists on the way out for PDP in Ekiti State, said, “This is a litmus test for the Senator Ayu-led NWC. The national chairman must stand up and be firm on this. He must not put the party in Ekiti in jeopardy. Don’t forget that what happens in Ekiti can spill over to Osun State. The use of super delegates is the way to go. “There is no denying the fact that we have a problem in Ekiti PDP and if there is a problem, you look for a solution. There is controversy trailing the election of party executives in Ekiti State. The Senator Biodun Olujimi faction is in court over the composition of the executives and the outcome could go either way. “I think the national leadership should look at it that if they elect the party’s flag-bearer, there could be a problem. If they (executives) participate in the governorship primary and the court rules in favour of Olujimi group, if the candidate becomes the governor of the state, such an election could be easily annulled.” Copyright PUNCH.
