The Group Chief Executive of Oando Plc, Mr Wale Ojo, has said the firm reached provided scholarships and other educational aids for two million Nigerian pupils in public schools in the last 11 years. Tinubu, who made this known via his Twitter handle to commemorate the International Day of Education, said the company, through Oando Foundation, also carried out career talks, schools rehabilitation and capacity training for teachers across the country. He added that many of the beneficiaries had recorded remarkable strides, through their academic performance while others had represented their states and local governments areas in different academic competitions. He noted that the role of education for peace and development could not be overemphasised as without inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong opportunities for all, countries could not break the cycles of poverty and inequality. “I am constantly inspired by Oando Foundation’s 11-year journey. We set out to bridge the education gap in Nigeria with infrastructure development, scholarships, and teacher capacity building. So far, we’ve impacted the lives of two million Nigerians,” Tinubu said. He added, “As we commemorate #EducationDay, I look forward to both public and private sector players collectively reimagining the future and committing to the transformation of education to build more sustainable, inclusive, and peaceful futures. #InternationalDayofEducation.” “Today, the little seed that was inspired by those two great men has not only germinated, but it has also grown beyond the foundation’s expectation and bridged the gap by transforming the lives of more than one million lives of Nigerian children through education.”  Copyright PUNCH.
