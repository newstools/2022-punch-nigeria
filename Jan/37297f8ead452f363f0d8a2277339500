At the beginning of the year, a Rolling Stone column written by a former Occupy Wall Street organiser, Jesse A. Myerson, listed and explained five economic reforms our generation should fight for today. His ideas included a desire to seize private property for public ownership. Perhaps, the most alarming was his idea for a society that just gives money to all its citizens. Most of his suggestions were reflective of characteristic laziness, short-term thinking and a failure to understand how a nation’s size affects policy. (Take an economics course!) More recently, David R. Wheeler proposed a similar idea on the Cable News Network — stirring up quite the controversy. For all of the ridiculousness, the two are right to note America’s imperfection and the potential power our generation in Nigeria has to improve the nation. For me, however, here are five ways we actually can improve our society without creating economic chaos: Note: None of these ideas really involves the government. Though many of the ideas overlap, they all require individual responsibility and effort. Instead of just relying on a government or other body to improve our society, let’s improve it ourselves. And while these ideas do not solve all of society’s problems, they could only help us. Millennials, let’s lead by example.
