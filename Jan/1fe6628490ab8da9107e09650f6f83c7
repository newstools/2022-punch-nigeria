Super Eagles striker, Odion Ighalo, has joined Saudi Arabian side, Al-Hilal on a one-and-a-half-year deal from rivals Al Shabab on Saturday. Al-Hilal who are currently fourth in the Saudi League announced the signing of the Nigeria international on their social media handles on Saturday until June 2023. The striker is a direct replacement for Bafétimbi Gomis. The Frenchman’s contract was terminated on January 24. The former Manchester United striker is currently the top scorer in the Saudi Arabian league with 13 league goals from 19 appearances but his transfer will come as a shock to Al Shabab fans. Al Hilal are fourth on the table, 10 points behind log leaders Al-Ittihad. Ighalo’s transfer may be connected to the debacle he had with the Al Shabab after their refusal to release him for the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, a situation which left the West African nation without experience in attack in the competition.
