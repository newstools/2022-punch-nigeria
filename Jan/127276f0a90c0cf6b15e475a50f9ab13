According to the statement, the business school, which enjoys the support of Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, Germany, has reputable consultants and organisations such as Ernst & Young, MTN, Microsoft, Google, Agusto and others. Commenting on the KPMG ranking, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Wema Bank, Ademola Adebise, said it was an affirmation of the bank’s commitment to the growth and wellbeing of SMEs as critical contributors to the economy. “At Wema Bank, we recognise SMEs as an important part of the economy, and we are always on the lookout for their well-being.
