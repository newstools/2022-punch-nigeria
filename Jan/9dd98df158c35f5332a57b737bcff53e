An Ekiti State Chief Magistrate’s Court, Ado Ekiti District, has ordered the remand in custodial centre of a 38 years old man, Yakubu Wakili, for alleged kidnapping. When the matter came up on Wednesday, police prosecutor, Inspector Olumide Bamigbade, said, the defendant “is reasonably suspected to have committed the offence of kidnapping of Ojo Ayobami, Abanikanda Kehinde, Abanikanda Serifat and also maliciously damaged cassava and yam farms belonging to Daramola Omoniyi Michael and Olorunsola Akintoye.” According to the husband of one of the victims, who reported the matter at the police station, his 42 years old wife travelled to Ikole Ekiti on December 18, 2021 to process her palm kernel when the incident happened. He said, “When I expected her to come back and she did not return, I called her telephone line, while answering, she was crying. She said that she had been kidnapped alongside others on their way back to Ikole Ekiti. “Thereafter, I put several calls to the line, but she did not take the calls anymore.” The prosecutor said, “The offences run contrary to and punishable under Section 3(a) of the Kidnap and Terrorism (Prohibition) Law of Ekiti State, 2015 and Section 451 of the Criminal Code Cap. C16 Laws of Ekiti State, 2012.” Bamigbade urged the court to adjourn the matter to enable issuance of legal advice from the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Magistrate, Kay Williams, who granted the plea of the prosecutor, ordered that the defendant be at the Nigeria Correctional Centre, Ado Ekiti pending issuance of legal advice from office of DPP. The magistrate adjourned the case till January 17, 2022 for mention.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
