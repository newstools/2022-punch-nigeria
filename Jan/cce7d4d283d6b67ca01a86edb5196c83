The wife of the alleged kidnapper and killer of a five-year-old girl, Jamila Abdulmalik Muhammad Sani, has been arraigned before Kano State Chief Magistrate Court sitting at Gidan Murtala, Kano. She was arraigned on a count charge of alleged concealing of a kidnap victim. Jamila, 30, is a wife to Abdulmalik Tanko, who is standing trial on a four-count charge of concealing a kidnapped victim, conspiracy, kidnapping and culpable homicide. Reading over the First Information Report to Jamila, the prosecution alleged that she concealed a kidnapped victim in her house for five days. ”That you Jamila Muhammad Sani, a wife to Abdulmalik Tanko Muhammad, a proprietor and teacher of Noble Kids Comprehensive Academy located at Kwanar Dakata in Kano State, on the 4th December 2021 around 1830hrs your husband brought to you Hanifa Abubakar a 5-year-old pupil, wearing her school uniform and spent five days in your custody. “You kept her (Hanifa) hostage knowing fully that she was kidnapped by your husband and you refused to disclose it to any person,” the First Information Report stated. According to the Prosecution, the offence contravenes Section 227 of the Penal Code. Jamila, however, denied the content of the First Information Report. Consequently, the prosecuting counsel, Barrister Lamido Soron Dinki, prayed the court to remand the defendant in police custody pending when the case diary is ready. The Presiding Judge, Chief Magistrate Muhammad Jibril ordered the defendant to be remanded in State Criminal Investigation Department and adjourned the sitting to 2nd February, 2022 for further mention.
