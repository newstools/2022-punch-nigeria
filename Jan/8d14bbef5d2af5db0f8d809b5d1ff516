The Ondo State Security Network Agency, also known as Amotekun Corps, has said it arrested no fewer than 600 suspected criminals during the Christmas and New Year celebrations. The state Commander of the corps, Akogun Adeleye, who disclosed this during an interview with our correspondent, said the suspects were arrested for their involvement in criminal activities in the state during the festive period. Adeleye, who also disclosed that over 500 vehicles were impounded, stated that some of the suspects had been charged to court He said, “We assured the people of Ondo State hitch-free Christmas and New Year festivities and to the glory of God throughout the period, there were no criminal activities. In one or two instances where we had security breaches, the criminals were all arrested and brought to book. “In the last one month, for only two weeks, the ban on unregistered vehicles and vehicles without permits and the restriction on the use of Okada in the night, brought to a standstill 80 per cent criminal activities in Ondo State. “Initially, people were not happy until they realised that it was for their good. Again, within the first 15 days of manning all major junctions and entry points of the state capital and all local government headquarters, we were able to impound over 550 vehicles and arrest over 600 suspects. “We found out that criminal activities in the main towns went down completely and people travelling started having problems. That was why we moved to the border patrols and you will recall that within 48 hours of commencement of the patrols, we were confronted by kidnappers and armed robbers. Seventeen victims were rescued in two separate operations.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
