The senator representing Ogun West Senatorial District, Tolu Odebiyi, has called for a probe into the circumstances that led to the death of five persons during the clash between farmers and herders in the Imeko-Afon Local Government Area of the state. Odebiyi demanded that a thorough investigation be carried out by the Police without further delay to unravel the identities of those behind the dastardly act and apprehend them. The senator, in a statement he personally signed on Sunday, lamented the incessant cases of harassment and brutalisation traceable to herders in Yewa land. He called on the government to put adequate measures in place to resolve the conflict between the farmers and herders in the communities. According to him, modern animal husbandry practices remain the panacea to herders/farmers clashes in Nigeria. Odebiyi said, “It is unlawful to allow herders to graze on people’s farms unchecked, to the point that law-abiding citizens are rendered hapless. “The State Commissioner of Police, Ogun State Command and other relevant authorities should urgently look into the matter in order to tackle the unpleasant farmers/herders situation reverberating around Idofa in Imeko-Afon Local Government Area. “Residents of Ogun West have gone through a lot of stress in the hands of herders. It is the responsibility of the Police to protect the lives and property of the citizenry and bring peace to the polity.” Odebiyi sympathised with the families affected and victims of the incident that occurred in Idofa village in Imeko-Afon.
