The Chinedu Okonkwo-led faction of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria has described the inauguration of a parallel National Executive Committee for IPMAN as illegal. It disclosed this in a statement by its Board of Trustees issued in Abuja by its Secretary, Tunji Adeniji, stressing that the January 18, 2022 inauguration by the parallel faction was null and void. The faction that has its President as Debo Ahmed, held its Annual General Meeting and inauguration of its newly elected National Executive Committee in Abuja on Tuesday. Adeniji warned that the inauguration was against a court judgement, adding that the BoT led by Abdulkadri Aminu notified security agencies of the illegal inauguration of NEC by some group of individuals. He said that the current Board of Trustees of IPMAN received information of plans by some faction of IPMAN to install another leadership for IPMAN on January 18. Adeniji argued that the move was a flagrant violation of the judgment delivered by the Supreme Court in Abuja on December 14, 2018. He said the judgment read by Justice Musa Muhammad in suit No. SC15/2015, recognised Chinedu Okoronkwo and Danladi Pasali, as President and Secretary of IPMAN, respectively with other elected executives. He said the tenure of the executive would expire on December 14, 2023, adding that IPMAN had already zoned the next president of the association to the North-West.  All rights reserved.
