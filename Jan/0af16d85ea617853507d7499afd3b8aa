The Christian Association of Nigeria has partnered with the riverine community of Bomadi, headquarters of Bomadi Local Government Area of Delta State, in spiritual warfare to tackle what the Ijaw community tagged the abject poverty in their land. The event, which took place on Sunday under the auspices of the 25th Ijaw Day of Thanksgiving, featured “prayers for the rapid progress and development in Ijaw land and the Niger Delta region in general to overcome abject poverty and marginalization in the oil-rich region”. Addressing the gathering, the Chairman of CAN, Bomadi Local Government Chapter, Dr Liberty Usiayo, explained that the essence of the annual thanksgiving was to show appreciation to God for His love and care for the ethnic nationality in all situations. He said, “The essence of this annual thanksgiving is to appreciate God for His goodness and mercies for the Ijaw nation. We are also here praying for the unity and well being of Ijaw land. “The scripture says in Isaiah 41:21 that we should come to God with a strong reason why He should answer our prayers; our prayer is that God should do greater things for the Ijaw nation. “We are also using this medium to appeal to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa to either give Bomadi a higher educational institution or locate faculties of the existing state institutions in the riverine area.” CAN used the forum in rededicating the Ijaw community to God with a 14-point prayer list for better living standards. The prayers included spiritual binding of project duplication and the spirit of abandoned projects in Ijaw land as well as seeking the face of God for successful completion of ongoing development projects in the area, among others.
