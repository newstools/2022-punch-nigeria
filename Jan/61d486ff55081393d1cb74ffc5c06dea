A food market near the Federal Polytechnic, Oko, Orumba North Local Government Area of Anambra State has been razed by fire. Items worth millions of naira were destroyed in the market as a result of the fire. It was gathered that the fire took place in the early hours of Sunday. There was no loss of life. An eyewitness said the police who arrived the scene shortly after the incident, quickly barricaded the area to prevent people from looting the shops. Police spokesman, Mr Ikenga Tochukwu, who confirmed the market fire, said the Commissioner of Police, Echeng Echeng, had ordered for a comprehensive investigation into the incident. He said, “The Commissioner of Police, Echeng Echeng, is worried by recent fire incident which resulted into loss of valuable properties. “The police quickly responded by cordoning off the area to avert hoodlums from taking advantage of the situation to loot, and contacted the fire service department. “The fire was successfully put off but the cause is yet to be ascertained. “The CP advised members of the public to always take precautionary measures to avert such ugly incidents and avoid storing highly combustible materials in their homes, offices or business premises as these are capable of causing a raging inferno. “The CP enjoined parents and guardians to keep tabs on their children and keep inflammable substances away from the reach of children. “Also in the event of an unavoidable fire outbreak, members of the public are advised to use fire extinguishers, and promptly call fire service station/office, the police and other disaster management outlets nearest to them for necessary assistance.” Copyright PUNCH.
