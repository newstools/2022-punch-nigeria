The Bayelsa State Commissioner for Industry, Trade and Investment, Federal Otokito, who was released by his kidnappers on Monday, said he almost died in their custody. He said this while thanking Governor Douye Diri, his deputy, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, and security agencies for rescuing him alive. Otokito was freed five days after some gunmen believed to be crude oil thieves kidnapped him on January 20 from his country home, Otuokpoti, in the Ogbia Local Government Area of the state. His assailants were angry that he reportedly opposed their plan to set up an illegal oil refinery in the community’s forest. The Commissioner of Police, Ben Okolo, and the State Director of State Security Services, Mohammed Abdullahi, presented him to Diri on Monday evening at the Government House, Yenagoa. Otokito had injuries on his body with swollen black eyes, bandages on his back and right arm. Narrating his ordeal in the hands of his kidnappers, the commissioner said he thought he would not return home to see his children. Otokito said, “Your Excellency, I want to sincerely thank you and the deputy governor and the entire (rescue) team for intervening in my matter. “If not for your prompt intervention, the pressure the government put on them (kidnappers), I could have been a dead man. I am very grateful to you, the Deputy Governor, security agents and whoever joined hands to bring me back to life. “I was almost a dead man. I thought I would never even come back to see my children. So, I am grateful, your excellency. I said let me thank you and the team.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
