A Coalition of Northern Groups on Monday tackled the state chapters of the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party over the political violence witnessed last Saturday in Funakaye Local Government Area of Gombe State. The CNG therefore called on the state government and security agencies to ensure they put an end to political violence in the state. The PUNCH reported that the PDP’s Publicity Secretary, Muritala Usman, had alleged that the APC sent thugs to disrupt activities at the venue of the reception organised for defectors. The spokesman of the APC, Moses Kyari, has since debunked the allegation. The state coordinator of CNG, Mohammad Ibrahim, in a statement on Monday said both parties should adhere to constitutional provisions, stressing that their members should eschew violence. The statement read, “We wish to bring to the notice of government and security agencies the recent incidence that happened in the state which involves political parties. “The coalition wants to note with utmost dismay the seeming consistency in the occurrence of such event in the state. If we may recall last year November 2021, an incident happened in the capital which was politically-inclined that led to loss of lives and property. We want to note that the causalities were 100 youths. “Again, on January 22, 2022, a similar incident happened in Funakaye that led to attack and destruction of property between the two political parties -APC and PDP. “We condemn all these acts perpetrated by those miscreants. We want to call on the government and security agencies to bring an end to this act of seeming consistent political violence that is gradually ravaging the state at the moment.” Copyright PUNCH.
