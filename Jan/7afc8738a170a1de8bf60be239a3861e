Following Sunday’s 1-0 ouster of Nigeria by Tunisia in the ongoing African Cup of Nations in Garoua, Cameroon, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has pleaded with Nigerians not to write off the team and its officials. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, disclosed this in a statement he signed late Monday titled ‘Don’t write off Super Eagles, pleads President Buhari’. According to Buhari, although the team did not live up to Nigerians’ expectations in the tournament, both officials and players deserve commendation for the tough fight they put up. The President argued that the Super Eagles “Gave everyone the confidence that they were up to it, and I am sure it was something they could have achieved. Nonetheless, we should not write them off.” He urged Nigerians to encourage the players to do better next time, especially in view of the World Cup qualification matches that have been lined up for them. Buhari, therefore, directed the football authorities in the country to undertake a critical assessment on the Eagles’ performance at the Cup of Nations tournament and encouraged the general public to send their suggestions to the Nigeria Football Federation so that it will reflect and plan well for a better outing in the forthcoming World Cup competition.
