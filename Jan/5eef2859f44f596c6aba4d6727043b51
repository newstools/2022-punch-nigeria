A group, the Concerned of Rivers State, has appealed to the state governor, Nyesom Wike, to give consideration to the emergence of the next governor from the riverine area of the state. The group, codenamed CC23, said in Port Harcourt on Tuesday that the call for the emergence of the next governor from the riverine side was for equity and justice. The group’s leader, Ken Robinson, spoke in response to a statement by Senator Bennett Birabi who had called for a governor of Ogoni ethnic nationality in 2023. Robinson said such call undermined the political arrangements in the state and may threaten peace in the state, saying that Ogoni is part of the upland that has been in power. He said, “It will be appropriate to urge the governor of Rivers State and leader of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state, , Chief Nyesom Wike, to permit history to further write his name in gold by giving consideration to the emergence of a governorship candidate from the riverine ljaw section of the state, under the PDP, in the 2023 governorship elections. “This will be a valued addition to the robust developmental initiatives of his administration.”  Copyright PUNCH.
