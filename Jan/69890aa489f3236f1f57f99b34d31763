Tyronne Ebuehi has arrived at Super Eagles camp in Garoua, making the total number of available players for Africa Cup of Nations increase to 26. Officials of Super Eagles said two players are still expected. Ebuehi arrived at the camp three days before their opening match against Egypt. The Venezia player has 10 caps for the Super Eagles after making his debut in 2017 against Togo. The two players expected are Jamilu Collins (SC Padeborn 07, Germany); and Odion Ighalo (Al-Shabab Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). Though the Nigeria Football Federation had said Ighalo would not be present at the continental competition, the player refused to train, hoping that the Saudi Arabian club would reconsider their stand.
