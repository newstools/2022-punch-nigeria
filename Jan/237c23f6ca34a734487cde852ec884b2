The Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, who declared his ambition for the 2023 presidential election on Tuesday, has said he’s not in contest with anybody but himself. Umahi said this while addressing State House correspondents after a meeting with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in Abuja, on Tuesday. The Governor had informed Buhari of his intention to contest for the 2023 presidential ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress. Asked to speak on what he and the President discussed, Umahi said, “We discussed politics, the growth of our party APC in Nigeria and the South-East, and the interest of the South-East in the 2023 presidency. He said if the APC throws its ticket to the southern part of Nigeria, his achievement in the past six years would enable him to clinch the ticket. He added, “The President believes that anyone that wants to run for the presidency must have to consult widely and go to all the leaders. We must do everything to remove ethnicity and religion in our polity so that this country can grow.” His visit to Buhari comes a day after APC chieftain, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, visited the President at the State House during which he declared his ambition to run for President in 2023. Umahi, who was made aware that others will be contesting for the APC ticket, stated that “I’m not in contest with anybody; I’m in contest with myself.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
