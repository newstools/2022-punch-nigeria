Governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri, says his administration will work hard to improve the socio-economic condition of residents in the state in the New Year. Diri said this in his state-wide 2022 New Year address to the people of the state on Saturday. He said he was aware that many families and residents struggled to survive in 2021 as a result of economic hardship. Diri said, “I acknowledge that although as a state we have made considerable advancement in set goals, I am not oblivious of the reality that many families and individuals struggled through 2021. “I feel your pain and know your frustrations. It is my sincere prayer that 2022 will bring better tidings than the past year for you and all of us. As a government, we will continue to take the necessary actions to address the challenges of unemployment, poverty, hunger, inequality and poor health.” He said despite the several challenges, particularly funding, in 2021, his administration made some progress in healthcare, education, agriculture, youth and women empowerment, security, sports, infrastructure and reconciliation of aggrieved communities, among others. According to him, a number of projects will be due for opening during the second anniversary of his administration in February. He added, “This is the time for genuine friends of the state to align with the prosperity vision so that together we can transform challenges to opportunity and prosperity.” Copyright PUNCH.
