The National Directorate of Employment has commenced a training programme for 586 unemployed youths and women in Kogi to enable them to acquire marketable skills that will make them self-reliant. The training, which is under the Advanced and Basic National Open Apprenticeship and Quick Fix Demand-Driven Skills schemes of the Vocational Skills Development Department, is also aimed at curbing the rising insecurity across the country. Declaring the training programme open in Lokoja on Tuesday, the Director-General of NDE, Mallam Abubakar Fikpo, said the training would enable the beneficiaries to acquire the requisite skills to be able to provide services that would add value to the society and enable them to earn a good living. Fikpo, who was represented by the Kogi State Coordinator, NDE, Mallam Abubakar Zakari, expressed the determination of the Federal Government to create jobs for the unemployed citizens to alleviate poverty, hunger and insecurity across the country. He admonished youths to shun social vices such as cultism, drug abuse and prostitution. In his keynote address, the representative of the Director of Vocational Skills Development Department, Mallam Yusuf Umar, advised the participants to take the training seriously. Responding on behalf of the trainees, Yusuf Zamil, appreciated the NDE and the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for embarking on social investment programmes that had impacted positively the lives of Nigerians. He said the opportunity offered them would not be in vain but would be greatly justified. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
