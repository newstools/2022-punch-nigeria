The Ogun State Government has announced its plan to vaccinate 400,000 youths against the COVID-19 virus. This is part of its mass vaccination campaign, through the state’s Primary Health Care Development Board, which is focused on youths in and out of tertiary institutions in the state tagged ‘Operation Campus Storm’. This was contained in a statement signed by the Information Officer of the Ogun State Ministry of Information and Strategy, Ademola Orubon, made available to The PUNCH on Wednesday. During the launch of the exercise at the Tai Solarin University of Commissioner for Health, Dr Tomi Coker, represented by the Executive Secretary of the Board, Dr Elijah Ogunsola, stated that figures indicated that there was a huge vaccination gap in people between ages 18 to 25 in the state, hence the need to focus on them. Coker was quoted as saying that the campaign aimed to cover 70 per cent of students, as well as ensure their safety and protection from the virus before, during, and after teaching and learning periods. She said, “When we analysed our data, the statistics showed that the people of ages 18 to 25 have not been reached, so we have decided to focus on them in the next 15 days in our campuses. We have met with student leaders and other relevant stakeholders to ensure the success of the exercise,” The Commissioner also stated that the exercise which started on Monday, January 24, 2022, would last for 15 days, and would be extended to people outside tertiary institutions including “youths in communities, artisans, transporters, among others, urging residents to come out en-mass and be vaccinated”.
