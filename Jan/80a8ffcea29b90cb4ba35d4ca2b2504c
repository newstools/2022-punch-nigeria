A young man, identified only as Mohammed, has been shot dead while driving on a highway in the Federal Capital Territory. Mohammed was said to have been in a car with his friend, a member of the National Youths Service Corps who was in uniform, when a yet-to-be-identified person shot at them. The suspect was said to have overtaken them before pulling the trigger. The bullet reportedly broke the windshield and hit the victim; he died on the spot. The incident happened at the Jabi Airport Road area of the FCT on Monday. A commercial driver, who spoke on condition of anonymity, claimed that Mohammed was also a corps member. He said, “There were two corps members in the car; one of them was in uniform. They overtook a car; the car later overtook them and someone shot at them. We don’t know what happened, but we just heard a gunshot. “The bullet penetrated through their windshield and hit his colleague, who was driving, in the forehead and he died immediately. The corps member in uniform was unhurt.” However, another source quoted an eyewitness as saying that the shooter was in a car with tinted glass. “The driver of the car was rough. He shot at their car and drove off,” he added. The FCT police spokesperson, DSP Josephine Adeh, said she did not have details of the incident, but promised to get back to our correspondent. She had yet to do so as of press time. The Director-General of the NYSC, Major General Shuaibu Ibrahim, however, said no corps member was killed. He said, “The person driving the car was shot. But nothing happened to our corps member who was with him. The police led us to trace him; he is Okay. We suspect that the man that was killed was the driver.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
