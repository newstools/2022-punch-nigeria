A church has been razed and 15 girls abducted by Boko Haram terrorists in a village near Chibok Local Government Area of Borno State, following an attack on Thursday night. A local vigilante was also killed during the attack, according to Channels Television. The name of the village is Pemi, the same area where a Pastor, Bulus Yukura, was kidnapped in December 2020. The assailants targeted the community church EYN NO 1 Pemi. Those abducted were picked from houses around the church; the girls are between the ages of 10 to 13, according to villagers. Chibok local government is located in the southern axis of the state. These attacks have become common in Chibok and environs, with many unreported which security sources attribute to its proximity to the Sambisa forest. Sambisa has been a known base of the outlawed Boko Haram militia, loyal to the late Shekau. Locals say attacks are more frequent during dry seasons as the terrain is more motorable for the insurgents. “The mud during the rainy season impedes their movement which is why we were able to access our farms. But once the rain stops and everywhere becomes dry these attacks are common. We need help.” A local source told Channels Television via telephone. In November the Commanding Officer of the 28 Task Force located in Chibok Brig General Dzarma Zirkushu was killed in an ambush on his way to provide enforcement to troops in distress in the next town. Pockets of attacks have continued ever since, worsening in recent times in villages on the fringes of the dreaded forest.
