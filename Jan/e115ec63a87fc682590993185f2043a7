The Lagos State Government has said it will collaborate with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency to tackle flooding in the state. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Drainage and Water Resources, Mr Joe Igbokwe, said this on Tuesday during a workshop organised to review the 2021 Seasonal Climate Prediction in Lagos. Igbokwe, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary of the office, Mr Lekan Shodeinde, noted the importance of reviewing climate data and providing safety for flood-vulnerable residents. He said, “SCP is an annual product of NiMet in which information on expected rainfall quarterly is released as Lagos is a low-lying state; we always monitor our SCP to better inform our people to be prepared to avoid flood-prone areas in order to protect their lives and property. “We are doing this review of the data obtained to compare what happened in 2021 and measure its impact which is mostly felt at the communal level comprising of already vulnerable and flood-insecure flood individuals, especially those living around the flood plain who have suffered floods due to intense and extreme rainfalls in recent times.” The Director-General of NiMet, Prof Mansur Matazu, who was represented by Mr Mailadi Yusuf, said the agency would continue to provide necessary information on climate change. “For us in NiMet, we will continue to provide all stakeholders of the desired information and proper steps required for people to take adequate measures for their safety,” he said.
