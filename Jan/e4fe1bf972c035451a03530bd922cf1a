Former Big Brother Naija housemate, Tobi Bakre, has revealed that being a father has been the best moment of his life. The reality TV star revealed this during a Question and Answer segment on his Instagram story on Saturday. Bakre and his wife, Anu, welcomed their first child together on December 30, 2021 and named him after his father. When asked how fatherhood was to him, the father-of-one described it as “the simplest and best moments of my life, really.” He added that fatherhood was “a lot of work and more to come” but he had so much “joy, happiness, and willingness to do it.” The actor also revealed that he was in the delivery room when his child was born, describing the moment as “surreal.” Tobi and Anu got married in August 2021 as they also announced that they were expecting their first child. Bakre, who is also a compere and a photographer, came to limelight as a finalist of the Big Brother Naija reality TV show in 2018. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
