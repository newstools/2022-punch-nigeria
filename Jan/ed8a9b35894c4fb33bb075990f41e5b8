The Lagos State Government has called on school administrators in the state to adequately monitor the students in their schools in order to curb negative tendencies. The Commissioner for Education, Mrs Folasade Adefisayo, in a statement on Tuesday, said bullying, cultism and other vices would not be tolerated in Lagos schools. She said, “It is necessary to devise appropriate strategies to advance teachers/students interaction to gain insight and expose negative tendencies before they metamorphose into unfortunate situations. “Adequate monitoring, especially as it affects boarding school students, should be instituted to prevent the incidence of bullying and all other vices on school premises and all potential dangers outside the walls of the schools are minimised through stipulated channels.” “The warning of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu should be reiterated that bullying, cultism and other vices will not be tolerated in Lagos schools, and school administrators are advised to increase counselling of students against such vices,” she said.
