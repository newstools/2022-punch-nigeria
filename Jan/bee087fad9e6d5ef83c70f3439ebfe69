The Lagos State Government has called on members of the Federal Road Safety Corps to establish a good relationship with community leaders and community development associations in the discharge of their duties on roads. The Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs, Dr Wale Ahmed, said this according to a statement made available to journalists, during the courtesy visit by a delegation from the Federal Road Safety Corps, Lagos State Sector Command. He said, “I want to encourage the FRSC to take advantage of the relationship with the leaders at the grassroots and reach out to residents of communities. This gesture will help change the perceptions of the people about their operations, thereby gaining full acceptance and engendering peaceful operation within the various communities.” Ahmed urged the corps members to make use of the various platforms provided by the ministry. “There is the Joint Account Allocation Committee meeting for local government chairmen, community development advisory council meetings and market advisory council meetings for market leaders in the state that can be interacted with because periodic sensitisation of the public during such meetings would help to ensure adequate safety of lives and property,” he said. The FRSC, Lagos State Sector Commander, Olusegun Ogungbemide, stated that synergy with communities is needed to curb road accidents, abuse of number plates and threat to state security.
