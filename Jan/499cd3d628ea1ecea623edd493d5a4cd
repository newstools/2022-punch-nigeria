A team of local vigilantes in Benin City, the Edo State capital, has rescued 28 victims of human trafficking. The Coordinator of the state Community Vigilante Security Network, Oboh Otoide, disclosed this while addressing journalists in Benin City on Saturday. He said the victims, who were between the ages of 13 and 17, were rescued during a stop-and-search operation by his men. Otoide stated, “The victims were rescued by our men around 2am on Tuesday along the Akpakpava Road in Benin City. Three suspects, including two drivers conveying the victims to their destinations, were arrested during the operation and handed over to the Department of State Services for further investigation. “Our preliminary investigations revealed that the victims were being moved from the South-East, en route from Edo State, to the southwestern part of the country.” Otoide said in another operation, officials of the group arrested a man, who was robbing residents of their personal belongings while pretending to be insane, adding, “The man, who identified himself as Olatunji, was arrested around the Baptist Church on Ring Road, Benin City, and has been handed over to the Nigeria Police Force. Among the items recovered from the suspects are ATM cards belonging to victims of his criminal acts.” He said the ESCVSN was working with other security agencies to secure the state. The coordinator urged residents to report criminal activities to the group’s central base control room through 09153333340 and 09153333341.
