A group under the aegis of Northern Organisation Umahi for President has lauded the aspiration of the Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, to lead Nigeria in 2023. The group code named its mission ‘Rescue Nigeria’, revealed that it began its move in 2021, precisely one year ago, adding that the candidate would ensure the transformation of the country to an enviable position. According to a press statement issued to journalists on Thursday, by the Coordinator, Modibbo Yahaya, their candidate has displayed impeccable character, worthy of trust to pilot the affairs of the country. The statement partly read, “We wish to welcome all crew members on board this vessel. The name of the vessel is ‘Rescue Nigeria’. It’s flying Umahi ’23 flag. We started constructing this vessel in January 2021. “We wrote to His Excellency, Dave Umahi, requesting him to vie for president. However, God has answered our prayers. So we decided to flag off the journey on 20th January, 2022. “We started from this harbor. We will be cruising all over, until when we get to our terminal, pray Allah will answer our prayers.” While explaining further the reason the group settled for Umahi, Yahaya stressed that the job of the president is one meant for credible persons, which their candidate exemplified. “We really need your cooperation. Our flag bearer is honest, reliable, trustworthy and a true nationalist. He is not sentimental either tribal, religious or otherwise,” the statement added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
