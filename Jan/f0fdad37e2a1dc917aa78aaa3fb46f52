The pan-Northern socio-political organisation, Arewa Consultative Forum, on Saturday, expressed concern over the killing of a five-year-old pupil, Hanifa Abubakar, by her teacher in a private school in Kano State. Besides, the ACF expressed disgust over the death of Sylvester Oromoni, a 12- year-old pupil of Dowen College, allegedly bullied, tortured to death by fellow students in December 2021. The ACF condemned the developments and urged state and federal governments to act quickly and nip the trends in the bud. This was contained in a statement signed by the National Publicity Secretary of the Forum, Emmanuel Yawe, released in Kaduna. The statement is titled, ‘ACF shocked at school bullyings, killings.’ It read, “The Arewa Consultative wishes to express its shock and revulsion over the anti-social and criminal acts going on in Nigerian schools. These border on bullying, murder, kidnappings, homosexuality, cultism etc.” “The Arewa Consultative Forum would like to call the attention of the authorities to this new epidemic of drugs, brutality, cults and death which is taking over all schools across the country and endangering the lives of our daughters on sons and the future of our country. “We call on our governments to step in forcefully and nip this trend in the bud,” it said.
