The Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Kaduna State, Rev. John Hayab, has hailed the state police command for raiding one of the hideouts of bandits and arresting two bandits. Hayab said, “CAN kaduna State wishes to commend the Kaduna police command for a job well done. “This is what Kaduna residents and citizens have been yearning and praying for. We hope this tempo will be sustained till criminals are defeated in our state. This development is good and cheering most especially since it is coming as we begin a new year. “CAN Kaduna State also wishes to inform the public that two of our Bethel Baptist High school students have been released by the bandits but one is still in captivity? “These children were kidnapped since July 5th last year others have been released with three remaining but One was released on Tuesday 28th December 2021 and another one yesterday 1st January 2022. “We hope that the sustainable effort like this from the police may help to bring back the one and last of student and others who are still in captivity back home very soon.” Hayab, who’s also the Vice Chairman of the association in the North, added, “These bandits have toyed with the joy and peace of kaduna people enough and should not be given any space again to torment innocent citizens this new year. “CAN will continue to pray and support our security men and women just as we will also never stop to tell them the truth when they fail in their duties. “CAN, therefore, is appealing to all citizens not to keep to themselves any information that they have which could be useful to the security agencies in their operations. We need to remind ourselves always that security is everyone business.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
