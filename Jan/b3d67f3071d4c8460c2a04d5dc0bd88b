Super Eagles forward, Moses Simon, says the team will not be complacent when they face Sudan in their second Group D game on Saturday at the Roumdé Adjia Stadium in Garoua. Simon was one of Nigeria’s most outstanding players in the win against Egypt and was a thorn in the flesh of the Egyptian full-backs with his performance earning him plaudits from fans and the head coach, Austin Eguavoen. The Eagles returned to training on Wednesday ahead of their all-important game against Sudan with victory in the game set to hand the three-time champions one of the automatic tickets to the round of 16. Speaking ahead of the encounter, Simon says the Eagles will approach the game with the same intensity as that of Egypt, adding that there are no more minnows in African football. “The game against Sudan is something we have to be careful with, “Simon said after the team’s practice on Wednesday. “Today in Africa, there are no more small teams, we just need to go all in the way we did against Egypt. We will go into the game against Sudan with the same mentality and we have to do our best and give 100 per cent to get the three points.” The Egypt game was Simon’s 46th appearance for the Eagles. He’s found the back of the net five times. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
