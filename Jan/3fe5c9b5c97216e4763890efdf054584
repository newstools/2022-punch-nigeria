The President, Christian Association of Nigeria, Rev Olasupo Ayokunle, has called on Nigerians to embrace religious harmony and live in peace. Ayokunle said this at the inauguration of a secretariat built for CAN in the Irewole Local Government Area of Osun State by the Balogun Musulumi of Ikire, Mr Bola Oyebamiji. The CAN president, who expressed delight that Oyebamiji, a Muslim, who currently serves as the Osun State Commissioner for Finance, had taught every member of society a lesson on religious tolerance, also stressed that Nigerians should show love to people of other faiths. He said, “Bola Oyebamiji is someone my family has been very close to for the past 20 years and he has always been like this. He is a very good and tolerant man to everybody, no matter your religion. “I have always known him to be a partaker in the work of God, be it in the church or mosque. I must say this is laudable; this is what we have been preaching – harmonious relationship between all religions. It is exactly what God wants. “This is the only way we can achieve true peace in our nation. It is nice to know that the sponsor of this project for CAN Irewole is a devout Muslim. This gladdens my heart so much.” Oyebamiji, while speaking in a statement signed by his aide, Kingsley Omoyeni, in Osogbo on Friday, said he embarked on the project because he believed in service to humanity.
