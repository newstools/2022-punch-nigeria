Popular American actor, Nick Cannon, is reportedly expecting an eighth child with a renowned model, Breana Tiesi, a few weeks after he lost his five-month-old son, Zen. According to TMZ, Cannon and Tiesi organised a gender reveal party in Malibu on Sunday and as guests unloaded party poopers with blue confetti, it appeared that their baby was a boy. This comes two after the model finalised her divorce with American football quarterback, Johnny Manziel. Tiesi, who had an obvious baby bump posed with Nick, who cradled her belly amid celebration from guests. Cannon had in December revealed that he lost his seventh child, five-month-old Zen, to cancer. Cannon welcomed Zen with model Alyssa Scott in June 2021. Zen was the 4th of Nick’s kids born under eighteen months. He welcomed twins, Zillion and Zion, in June 2020 and his daughter, Powerful, in December 2019. Speaking in an interview about “the idea that a man should have one woman”, Cannon had said, “We should have anything … I have no ownership over this person. It’s about what exchange we can create together. “So I’ve never really subscribed to that mentality. I don’t want ownership over anybody. I don’t have ownership over any of the mothers.” He added that every woman “that I deal with or dealt with, they know how I feel.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
