The ruling All Progressives Congress has described as fake news a report (Not by The PUNCH) that its planned National Convention has been suspended till June. The party, on Wednesday, urged the general public to disregard the report, just as it pointed out that dates for party activities such as meetings, primaries, congresses, national conventions are communicated through well-known official channels and not through ‘sources’. National Secretary, APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, disclosed this in a statement titled ‘Update On APC National Convention.’ According to the statement, “The faceless authors and sponsors of fake news on APC activities, in this case, the planned National Convention are simply bent on causing confusion and fomenting crisis through misinformation. We should not enable them. “As a focus-driven, process-oriented political party, the APC Caretaker Committee under the leadership of Governor Mai Mala Buni will not be distracted by self-serving antics of these sponsors of fake news. The APC Caretaker Committee is already embarking on nationwide consultations with party stakeholders to prepare the ground for a rancour-free National Convention. To this end, the sub-committee on budgeting and other substructures will be set up in due course. “Finally, the party notes and appreciates the continued support of well-meaning members and leaders as the APC Caretaker Committee undertakes the immediate task of addressing contestations within the party, litigations, fallouts of recently-conducted congresses and generally reposition the party ahead of the National Convention.” Copyright PUNCH.
