A Niger Delta group, The South South Youths Initiative, on Saturday, promised a ‘mother of all protests’ in January following the failure of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari(retd.) to inaugurate the board of the Niger Delta Development Commission. The group made this known in a statement signed by its National President, Imeabe Oscar, and made available to journalists in Abuja. The statement reads in part, “In 2021, we commenced a protest to ensure that the right thing is done in NDDC, that is, the constitution of the Substantive Board of NDDC, which has long overdue. For a long time, the Commission has been manned by a structure that is not known to law and this has adversely affected the vision of the founding fathers of NDDC. “In January, we are going to hold a mother of all protests in Abuja. We are going to ensure that the Minister of Niger Delta, Sen Godswill Akpabio, is served with the meal he deserves. “We know that the delay in constituting the NDDC board is to make the process drag into 2022, when every attention would be on 2023 politics. By that time, attention would not be on this board again. That could then tarry till the end of 2022 because the President may not have the time. “However, we urge the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), to immediately constitute a substantive board of the NDDC as a New Year gift to the people. “Having this, in mind we are insisting that the right thing should be done by January, or else we would storm Abuja for the mother of all protests. We are going to storm Abuja with 10 caskets. We are going to ground activities at the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
