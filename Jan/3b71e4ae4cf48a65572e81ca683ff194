The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has said his administration will intensify work on intervention programmes to check the menace of gully erosion as part of efforts to alleviate the sufferings of residents in erosion-prone communities in the state. The governor told journalists after inspecting gully erosion sites in Ogiso Quarters and Urora in Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area of the state that his administration started addressing the flood challenges in the areas because before now, the places were devastated after a rainstorm. He said, “For us, it is about rebuilding our communities and improving the lives of our citizens. You can imagine the span of this drainage system with over 50 hectares of land and properties, which has now enhanced their values. “I believe this is what development is all about. This is how communities and citizens are being supported. But let’s not forget that all these won’t have happened without the assistance of the World Bank under the Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project.” “The purpose of this visit is to confirm that the underground drainage work has been properly completed and the next logical step is to make sure that the road network is covered and the communities have the full benefits that come with this project.” He added, “This project is not a fancy one. We need to invest in the environment so that we can protect people’s property and livelihoods.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
