The former Governor of Zamfara State, Abdul Aziz Yari, has begun the campaign for the national championship position of the All Progressives Congress. The campaign which was launched on Sunday in Gusau, the Zamfara State capital was organised by the Kabiru Marafa-led faction of the APC under the association called “Marafiya Amana”. Speaking at the event, the state’s chairman of Senator Kabiru Marafa-led faction of the party, Sirajo Maikatako, said they were solidly behind Yari’s political ambition of becoming the national party chairman of the APC. Maikatako said Yari and Marafa factions of the APC in the state were working in unison to ensure the success of the former governor in winning the election. “I want to bring to the notice of every APC member in the country that Yari has all it takes to be our next national chairman considering his track records both as the Governor of Zamfara State and the chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum,” Maikatako said. Also speaking, the APC chairman of the Yari-led faction of the party, Lawal Liman, said, “Yari has performed wonderfully well during his tenure both as a Governor and the chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum. “So if anybody is against his ambition to contest the chairmanship position of the party, it means that the person is not a true lover of the country.” Copyright PUNCH.
