Kano State Agro-Pastoral Development Project has budgeted N10,934,005,270 for the 2022 fiscal year, the State Project Coordinator, Malam Ibrahim Muhammad, has said. The financial plan was approved on Monday during a meeting of the project’s steering committee, chaired by the state Deputy Governor and Commissioner for Agriculture, Dr Nasiru Gawuna. According to Muhammad, about nine per cent of the total money was budgeted for crops and legumes value chain interventions for small holder farmers across the state, to be conducted with technical cooperation of Sasakawa Africa and KNARDA. Although he did not give specific details of the budget, he said, “A substantial amount was set aside for development of 1,000 hectares of land at Watari Irrigation project, expected to impact at least 4, 000 farmers.” He said the budget entailed a cattle and small ruminants fattening scheme, with 50 per cent matching grants, in addition to a small ruminants breeding scheme. “We are embarking upon these schemes to strengthen the role of livestock in rural livelihood improvement, economic development and especially because they are the main source of meat,” he said. On Dansoshiya Grazing Reserve, he said several physical works were scheduled for execution in the settlement this year, highlighting that the projects included infrastructure and grazing land development. According to Muhammad, the construction of feeder roads in some parts of the state, Dawanau market infrastructure and establishment of 40 milk collection centres are among the project’s priorities for the year.
