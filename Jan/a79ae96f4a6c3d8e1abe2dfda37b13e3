Sevilla have reached an agreement to sign Anthony Martial on loan from Manchester United. The 26-year-old will join the La Liga side – who will pay his wages in full – until the end of the season. Martial will fly from Paris, where he is currently located, to Seville on Tuesday to undergo a medical. The forward always wanted to join Sevilla this month, despite interest from Juventus and Barcelona, because he believes that is where he will play the most. There had been reports in December that Martial wanted to leave United in search of more game time. Martial became the world’s most expensive teenager when he joined United from Monaco in 2015 and went on to score 79 times in 269 appearances for the club. But he fell out of favour in the forward positions following the signings of Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho in the summer, as well as the emergence of Mason Greenwood. Martial has started just four games for United this season, and was accused by Ralf Rangnick, the club’s interim manager, of asking not to play in the 2-2 draw at Aston Villa on January 15. The France international refuted his manager’s claim, and Rangnick later insisted the situation was “resolved”. Following Saturday’s 2-2 draw at home to Celta Vigo, Sevilla are currently second in La Liga and just four points behind Real Madrid as they search for their first title since 1946.
