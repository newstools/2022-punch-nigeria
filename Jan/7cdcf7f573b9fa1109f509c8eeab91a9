The Art and Design teacher at Greensprings School, Anthony Campus, Lagos, Mrs Anuoluwapo Adeyemi, has advised schools in the country to promote art and fashion among their students. Adeyemi said this in a statement on Wednesday. She was quoted to have said this while speaking at a recent fashion show organised by the students of the school. According to her, organising art exhibitions and fashion shows, or generally providing the necessary support needed to teach the subject would help raise a generation that would take the Nigerian art and fashion industry to the next level. She said, “We recently did our 2021 fashion show, themed ‘The New Normal: #MixedMediaExpression,’ and based on this theme, our students showcased six clothing lines that brilliantly incorporated facemasks into their designs. Through the guidance of the teachers, our promising clothing liners did the sketching of their designs, sourced the fabrics, made the dresses, and managed fellow students who modelled the designs. “The show was a success, as it lets our students see that they can also express their creativity via organizing impressive fashion shows like the one they see on TV. From our students’ performance during the show, it is obvious that Nigeria is blessed with a lot of young talents and I believe that our art and fashion industry would receive more global recognition in years to come, especially if more schools give extra attention to creatively teaching the subject, as well as organising art exhibitions and fashion shows.”  Copyright PUNCH.
