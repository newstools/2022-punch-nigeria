The Edo State Government’s public-private sector partnership initiative, Ossiomo Power, has concluded an agreement with the Benin Owena River Basin Authority for the supply of electricity to the authority’s facilities. The Managing Director, Ossiomo Power, Dr. Uwa Igiehon, who disclosed this on Sunday, said the development was another milestone for the government-backed power initiative.He said, “The Benin Owena River Basin Authority, which is a Federal Government agency, had been cut off from the national grid for nearly four years. The community where it is located had been without electricity for that long. “However, when we completed our new 40MW plant, we provided electricity to Obayantor and Ologbo communities as well as the Benin Industrial and Enterprise Park. The Benin Owena River Basin Authority is located in the same area so we reached an agreement to connect them to our plant.” He noted that the power supply agreement would provide power to the facilities at the Federal Government-owned institution to enable it live up to its mandate. According to Igiehon, the company has an embedded power licence as well as a willing-buyer, willing-seller licence, which empowers it to sell electricity generated at its plant to companies and individuals willing to pay for power in its area of coverage. He expressed appreciation to the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, who instituted proactive policies in the electricity sector in the state to facilitate the company’s investment in power generation.
