Osun State Command of the Nigeria Correctional Service on Wednesday said it has commenced probe into the attempted jail break by inmates at Kosere Custodial Centre, Ile Ife. The command also said the inmates, while attempting to run away, manhandled some of its men, adding that armed officials later shot four of the inmates to stop them from fleeing. A statement by the command’s Public Relations Officer, Olusola Adeotan, obtained in Osogbo, said at about 11.48am on Tuesday, inmates of a certain cell had attacked some officials of the facility and freed inmates of other cells. Adeotan further explained that, having overpowered the officers due to their large number, the inmates surged to the main gate in a bid to escape. The statement read, “Recall that at about 11.48 hours, during a routine open-out of inmates for daily exercises, inmates in a particular cell attacked officers on duty and succeeded in breaking out more inmates from other cells. “Having overpowered the officers due to their large number, they surged to the main gate in a bid to break out from jail. While the officers trapped within the yard were being manhandled, the ensuing confrontation between the escaping inmates and armed personnel on guard duty resulted in four of the inmates being immobilised. “They were taken to the hospital for medical attention. Two of the injured inmates later lost their lives while the remaining two are still in the hospital, responding to treatment. The Controller of Corrections, Olanrewaju Amoran, was on ground to assess the situation. “He assures members of the public that the inmates are in safe custody and normalcy has returned to the yard while investigation is ongoing.”  Copyright PUNCH.
