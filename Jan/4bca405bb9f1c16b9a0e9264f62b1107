Guinea-Bissau coach Baciro Cande is expected to return to the bench when his side take on the Super Eagles in their final Group D game on Wednesday at the Stade Roumdé Adjia, Garoua, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Cande missed his side’s 1-0 loss to Egypt on Saturday after he tested positive for COVID-19, but his assistant Emiliano Te, who took charge of the team in the 1-0 defeat to Egypt on Saturday, said he was expected back in the team for their final group game. The Djurtus are third in Group D with one point and still have a mathematical chance of qualifying for the round of 16 as the best losers, should they fashion out an unlikely win over the Eagles. Te, however, remains optimistic about his side’s chances against the group leaders. “We won’t take the game with levity. We still have a chance of qualifying for the next round if we beat you (Nigeria),” Te said. “Our head coach is expected to return and hope things turn around. We were just unlucky against Egypt. “We are constantly working to improve and we will prepare well for Nigeria,” he added. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
