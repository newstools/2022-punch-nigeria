The Managing Director of Ogun State Property and Investment Corporation, Abiodun Fari-Arole, says the newly inaugurated Kings Court estate will be duplicated in other parts of the state to accommodate more subscribers. A statement by the corporation quoted Fari-Arole as saying this in Abeokuta while speaking with the OPIC Press Officer, Mrs. Olabisi Adegbite, shortly after the inauguration of the estate by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari. The OPIC boss said the proposed housing projects would be constructed in semi-detached apartments to make it affordable to the people, adding that the houses would be similar to those constructed in Agbara and New Makun City. Fari-Arole noted that the newly built estate was one of the landmark projects of the Prince Dapo Abiodun-led administration meant to serve as a springboard towards more economic growth and development. He urged the people to cooperate and support the governor in his ‘Building Our Future Together’ agenda. Presenting the keys to some beneficiaries, the Director of Marketing and Business Development, OPIC, Mr. Dehinde Boye, enjoined them to live in peace and harmony with one another and ensure proper upkeep of the estate to maintain its standard. Speaking on behalf of other beneficiaries, Dr. Femi Shodipo, said the process of eligibility was highly transparent, commendable and devoid of nepotism, appealing to the State government to do more of such projects.
