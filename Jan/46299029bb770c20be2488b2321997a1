The wife of Ekiti State Governor, Bisi Fayemi, says she is not contesting the Ekiti North Senatorial District ticket of the All Progressives Congress. She described viral posters claiming she nurses an ambition to become a federal lawmaker as the handiwork of mischief-makers. Bisi, in a statement on Friday, said those behind the mischief launched the campaign of lies against her person after Biodun Oyebanji emerged as the governorship candidate of the APC for the June election in Ekiti The governor’s wife also said those floating the narrative that the senatorial seat is going to be her reward for supporting Oyebanji’s aspiration lied. The statement titled, ‘Statement By Ekiti State First Lady’, partly read, “I have no interest whatsoever in contesting for a Senatorial seat. I have never discussed this with anyone and how this story keeps circulating is a mystery. Let me repeat, I am not interested. “My sole political agenda in Ekiti State is to support my husband, HE Dr Kayode Fayemi, and to ensure that he finishes well. My husband’s success is the only reward I need. “The Ekiti APC Primaries were held on January 27th, and a winner was declared by the relevant authorities. Many people of all ages spent a lot of time promoting their candidates online, a very important part of the political process. “However, this can be done without resorting to slander, libel, and other untoward acts. While the principals concerned will find ways to resolve their differences, those who bear arms in their name on all sides need to be careful. I would therefore like to appeal for a cessation of hostilities and for all hands to be on deck.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
