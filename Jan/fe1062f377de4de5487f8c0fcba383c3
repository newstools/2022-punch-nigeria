Real-time transportation data globally suggests there has not been any significant impact on oil demand so far from Omicron, Rystad Energy’s Head of Oil Markets, Bjornar Tonhaugen, has said. Tonhaugen said this in an oil market report, adding that the Omicron variant remained a risk, according to Rigzone. “Instead of an outright deeper lockdown impact, market balances will remain somewhat tight for January and February and keep oil prices supported, especially with supply side concerns and a disciplined OPEC+,” he said In the report, Tonhaugen noted that ongoing outages in Libya, struggling production recovery in Nigeria, and reduced expectations for Russian production capacity add “bullish weight” to the scale from the supply side. On November 26, 2021, the World Health Organization announced that it had designated the B.1.1.529 strand as a variant of concern named Omicron. The organisation noted that the B.1.1.529 variant was first reported to WHO from South Africa on November 24, 2021. Global confirmed cases of COVID-19 have increased consecutively every week since WHO’s Omicron announcement. The week commencing December 27, 2021, saw the highest-ever number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at 9.52 million, WHO figures highlight. The previous weekly case record was reported in the week commencing April 26, 2021, at 5.69 million, WHO data shows. Global COVID-19 deaths have decreased for the past four consecutive weeks, according to WHO. As of January 4, 6.18pm CET, there have been 290.9 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 5.4 million deaths, WHO figures outline. A total of 8.6 billion vaccine doses are said to have been administered as of January 3.
