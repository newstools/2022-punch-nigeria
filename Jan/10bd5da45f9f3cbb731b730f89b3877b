The Lagos State Government has offered grants to 25 women-focused non-government organisations in the state for their roles in promoting women’s participation in socio-economic growth. The Commissioner for Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Mrs Bolaji Dada, said this in a statement on Sunday. Dada, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Mrs Oluyemi Kalesanwo, was quoted to have said this at an event in Alausa, Ikeja. She said, “These 25 NGOs across Lagos State have been at the forefront of promoting women’s participation for socio-economic growth. Their efforts have stimulated economic self-reliance and equal access within the labour market. “It is interesting to know that NGOs are not only directing their commitments towards government and inter-governmental processes, but also on regulations of women for a global ban on gender-based violence and the elimination of girl child slavery. “To support the complementary roles the NGOs play in championing the cause of government and service towards humanity, the grants provided are in fulfillment of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s well-articulated THEMES agenda which has served as a motivating force for his administration.” A representative of the International Federation of Women Lawyers, Lagos State branch, Chinwe Efobi, commended the state government for its continuous contributions towards empowering women. She promised that the NGOs would channel the grants into initiating, embarking and sustaining programmes and activities to support indigents and vulnerable women in the state.  Copyright PUNCH.
