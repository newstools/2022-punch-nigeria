A police inspector attached to the Ogun State Police Command, Omolayo Olajide, has lost his life during a gun duel between bandits and policemen in the state. The gun duel occurred on Tuesday at Isaala Orile Forest, Yewa North Local Government Area, Ogun State, where the bandits were attacking some Fulani herders. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday. Oyeyemi said operatives of the command gunned down two bandits in the fierce gun battle. According to Oyeyemi, the bandits were killed following a distress call received by policemen attached to the Ayetoro division. He explained that the police were told that a group of bandits were attacking some Fulani herdsmen at the Isaala Orile Forest. He said, “Upon the distress call, the DPO Ayetoro, CSP Bernard Ediogboyan, quickly led his men and operatives of the Joint Security Intervention Squad to the scene. “On sighting the policemen, the bandits opened fire on them and the policemen replied fire for fire. “At the end of the encounter which lasted for about 20 minutes, two among the bandits were shot dead, while others escaped with varying degrees of gunshot injury. “Regrettably, an inspector of police, Omolayo Olajide, lost his life during the gun duel. “Recovered from the bandits were three locally-made guns, 16 live cartridges, assorted criminal charms, one cutlass, one small phone, and one unregistered Bajaj motorcycle.” The PPRO said the state Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, expressed sadness over the death of the policeman. Oyeyemi said the CP had directed that the fleeing members of the gang be hunted and brought to justice.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
