Analysts have predicted that Ultimate Fighting Championship welterweight champion, Kamaru Usman, will lose his crown in 2022. Usman has dominated the welterweight division since joining the UFC franchise in 2015. He has since gone 15 fights unbeaten in the franchise leading to the welterweight crown which he has gone on to defend five times coming out victorious in all. After wins over Colby Covington,  Jorge Masvidal and Gilbert Burns to retain his titles, the ‘Nigerian Nightmare’ Is running out of options for available opponents but Englishman, Leon Edwards, who lost to Usman in 2015 has risen to the position of fourth contender. Edwards will be hoping to get a title shot sometime in 2022 unless he is usurped by one of his competitors. However, according to Dailymail, the only man with a chance of upsetting the champion is Cechen-born Swede Khamzat Chimaev. “The UFC are struggling to find opponents for him at the moment but if everyone keeps ducking, don’t be surprised if Dana White and Co give him a title shot anyway. “It is such a tough call given Usman’s utter dominance… but Chimaev will end the year as champion and the UFC’s next megastar.” Copyright PUNCH.
