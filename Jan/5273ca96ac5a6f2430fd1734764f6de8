Wema Bank Plc has reassured its stakeholders that it will continue to operate with best-in-class governance processes. The bank also faulted the premise on which a non-governmental organisation asked the Central Bank of Nigeria to remove its managing director/chief executive officer, describing the call as baseless. A statement from the Head, Marketing Communications and Investors Relations, Funmilayo Falola, said the bank reassured its customers and stakeholders that it had and would continue to operate with the highest level of corporate governance, following all rules, policies, and procedures. “We have no links to any political party and neither are we agents, allies or proxies of any politicians in the country. We are a financial institution solely committed to financial intermediation to enable and fast-track the socio-economic development of the country,” she said. According to the statement, Wema Bank’s observance and strict adherence to due diligence and extant rules and regulations is why it is the oldest surviving indigenous bank in Nigeria.
