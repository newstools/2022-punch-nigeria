The Northern Elders Forum has expressed sadness over the death of the presidential candidate of the National Republican Convention in the June 12, 1993 election, Bashir Tofa, describing him as “an indefatigable defender of its dignity and values.” The NEF expressed its grief in a statement issued on Monday by its Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed. He said, “The North has lost an indefatigable defender of its dignity and values. Nigeria has lost an illustrious son, a consummate politician who was denied the opportunity to provide leadership with the annulment of the Presidential elections In 1993. “The Forum lost a loyal founding member, a firm believer in responsible and visionary leadership. “Alhaji Bashir was the embodiment of the best combination of private enterprise and unparalleled philanthropy. His landmarks in Kano and the national economy will match the best. “History will record that Alhaji Bashir’s life was well spent in the service of God and fellow humans, and he will continue to be an inspiration to many generations of Nigerians. “The Forum also condoles the Supreme Council for Sharia in Nigeria, the people of Kano and Nigerian Muslims over the demise of Dr Datti Ahmad. We pray that Allah (SWA) will reward him for his pioneering service to his community with Aljannah Firdausi.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
