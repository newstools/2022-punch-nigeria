Bandits have attacked Damaturu Village, Damari, in the Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State on Sunday. The bandits, on motorbikes, were said to be on a revenge mission. “They came on many motorbikes, one bike was carrying the rider and two others. They showed no mercy. They were on rampage…it was rumoured they came on a revenge mission,” a source was quoted by Vanguard. “They were looking for members of the group of Malam Abba, a very wicked and dangerous bandit leader. The Kaduna State Police Command in 2020 said they are a terrorist group, members of Boko Haram. “The killers attacked the village on Sunday. They were shooting. The villagers ran away to different directions. “Last Friday, many bandits died when the boys of Malam Abba fought members of another gang. Those who came to Damari this morning were on a reprisal mission. They were told that Damari and environs were under the authority of Malam Abba.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
