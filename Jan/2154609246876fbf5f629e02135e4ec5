The Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate has urged retirees, especially those from the police, to be patient with the National Pension Commission regarding the Contributory Pension Scheme. The Executive Secretary, PTAD, Dr Chioma Ejikeme, said the perceived challenges might be a result of innovations. Ejikeme made the appeal in Gombe during an interview with journalists at the launch of ‘I Am Alive’ pilot test, shortly after a stakeholders’ forum with the theme ‘Pensioners welfare is our priority’. Responding to a question on recent protests by police retirees, he said there was a need to understand the processes within the CPS. Speaking further on the importance of the ‘I Am Alive’ web solution verification process, she said PTAD was empowered to cater to those who were not co-opted into the scheme. “PTAD came about as a result of the pension reform of 2004 repealed and re-enacted as Pension Reform Act of 2014. It is supposed to take care of pensioners who did not transit to the contributory pension scheme, and those are the pensioners who were already with the treasury funded before the introduction of the contributory pension scheme,” he said.
