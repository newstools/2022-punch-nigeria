Award-winning Nigerian singer, Divine Ikubor, popularly known as Rema, has promised to release an album before he’d start classes at the University of Lagos. This comes shortly after he announced his admission into UNILAG to study Creative Arts. Revealing that his mother fuelled his decision to continue schooling, that announcement post read, “What if I told y’all I got an admission into Unilag? Lol, Mum said I still need to get a degree. oh well, see you guys in class!” In a recent tweet on Friday, the singer, who is signed to Don Jazzy’s Mavin Records/ Jonzing World noted that he’d try to drop his forthcoming album before he enters school. According to him, he doesn’t want his UNILAG fans to beat him up if he failed to do so. “I will try to drop the album before I enter school. So they’ll not beat me in UNILAG. Plus, I’m in the Creative Art Department,” Rema tweeted. In an interview last year, the Champion crooner had hinted that his new album would be titled Raves and Roses. The singer, who described his music genre as Afrorave, had unveiled that his album will feature artistes like 6lack, Mahalia, AJ Tracey, and a host of others.
