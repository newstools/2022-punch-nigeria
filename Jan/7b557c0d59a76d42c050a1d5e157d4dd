A former Kano State Commissioner for Works, Mu’az Magaji, has been summoned by the police. Before he was summoned, Magaji had raised the alarm over an alleged plot by the Kano State Government to infringe on his rights, using the police. He later confirmed to our correspondent that he was invited to answer questions. “After failing to shut down my Facebook page, Kano state government has resorted to intimidating me, using the state police apparatus,” he had earlier posted on his Facebook page. But when contacted later, he said, “Moments ago, I was officially invited to Police SIB political unit, Kano on charges that I am still awaiting.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abdullahi Kiyawa, confirmed the former commissioner’s invitation. Kiyawa however failed to disclose the identity of who lodged the complaint which led to the invitation of Magaji who is an unrepentant critic of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje. Copyright PUNCH.
