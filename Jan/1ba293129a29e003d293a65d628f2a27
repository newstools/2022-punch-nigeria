Three passengers were injured on Sunday when a train crushed a Dangote Cement truck and a commercial tricycle in Kano State. The incident happened around 11.30am on Obasanjo Road. An eyewitness, who runs a business beside the rail tracks, said he noticed the truck speeding towards the rail line. The witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said efforts to flag down the truck and the tricycle because of the oncoming train, were abortive. “As the driver of the trailer attempted to cross the rail line, the train hit the vehicle and the tricycle simultaneously,” he added. The witness disclosed that passengers in the tricycle were rushed to a hospital unconscious, while the driver of the trailer escaped unhurt. As of the time of filing this report, the trailer was still overturned while some residents removed the bags of cement, as security agents prevented hoodlums from looting the goods. The Kano State Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps, Zubairu Mato, confirmed the incident, adding that three persons sustained injuries. He explained that the three victims, who were inside the commercial tricycle, were rushed to a hospital, while the truck driver escaped unhurt. “There was no death, but three persons sustained injuries and were taken to a hospital by our personnel,” Mato said.
