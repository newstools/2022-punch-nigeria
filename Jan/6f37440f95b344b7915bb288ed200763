A 43-year-old technocrat, Mr Chukwuka Monte, has decried the level at which the country has failed, saying the time to take over the governance of Nigeria from the older generation is now. The Delta State-born social innovator stated this on Saturday in Asaba while declaring his intention to contest for the position of the President in 2023. Monye, whose slogan is “our future is now”, wondered how Nigeria’s founding fathers would be content with the state of the nation. He said, “On this special day, which is also the Armed Forces Remembrance Day, I want to start by recognising and honouring our gallant and brave heroes, who fought and sacrificed for the existence of our great nation. “Although, I wonder if our founding fathers would be content with the state of our nation today. Some of the questions that come to my mind are; how are the Nigerians people faring? How are owners of small businesses able to sustain their livelihood? “How do we measure the value of a life when the pillars of the health sector are crumbling? How can we go about our daily lives freely when violence, crime and banditry are on the rise?” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
