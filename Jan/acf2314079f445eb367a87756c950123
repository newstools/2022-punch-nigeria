United Bank for Africa Plc has said it is expanding its services on its artificial intelligence chatbot, called Leo, and has concluded plans to commence Leo services on Instagram and Google Business. The bank said this in a statement that since the launch of Leo, it had recorded three million users. According to the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, UBA, Mr Kennedy Uzoka, Leo is one of the bank’s biggest investments in cutting-edge technology and has been steadily changing the face of banking in the continent. He said, “With over almost four million customers and counting, UBA’s Leo has, without a doubt, remained the smartest banking chatbot in Nigeria because of its speed and quick learning intelligence and has continued to evolve with plenty to offer its teeming customers. “While other financial institutions are still trying to find their feet as regards artificial intelligence, we can proudly say that our Leo has become a massive success as it continues to consolidate on its successes and accolades winning several awards in a short while of its existence.” He added, “In just four years, Leo’s landmark achievements have been indeed overwhelming, covering 20 African countries as well as garnering over 10 prestigious awards globally, a feat that is exceptional by every standard. I must say we are proud of Leo’s intimidating achievements which are largely unbeatable. “With this in mind, we have ensured that Leo continues to enjoy periodic and systematic upgrade with special emphasis on enhanced advancements and specialised unique features where necessary.” Copyright PUNCH.
