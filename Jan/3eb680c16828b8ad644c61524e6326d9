Former Bafana Bafana midfielder, Teko Modise, has warned Nigeria against Sudan, who he believes will be physical when they file out against the three-time Africa Cup of Nations champions in their second Group D encounter on Saturday. The Super Eagles will be hoping to grab their second three points of the group when they face off against the Falcons of Jediane at the Roumdé Adjia Stadium in Garoua after their 1-0 win over seven-time champions Egypt in their opening game on Tuesday. Sudan showed their physicality in their opening group game against Guinea-Bissau, which ended goalless, conceding a total of 18 fouls and receiving two yellow cards. Modise, who played 66 times for the South African national team, says being physical and aggressive may be the approach of the North African side. “No one wants to get injured in this kind of tournament and when you play against a physical team, you as players tend to be more careful,” Modise, a pundit on SuperSport for the AFCON, said. “Sometimes, these teams use what they have against bigger teams. The Sudanese team were very physical against Guinea Bissau and if they can do that against them, imagine how they will play against Nigeria,” he added.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
