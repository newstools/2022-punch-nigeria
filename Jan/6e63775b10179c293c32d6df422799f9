Grammy award-winning singer, Ayo Balogun, popularly known as Wizkid has postponed the Canadian leg of his Made in Lagos album world tour. The Essence crooner made the announcement via his Twitter page on Wednesday naming public health restrictions by the Canadian Government as a reason for the postponement. “Due to existing and public health measures being introduced by the Canadian Government, I will no longer be able to perform my Canadian shows in January. I’m looking forward to returning as soon as possible,” he wrote. Last year, after a whirlwind of shows in the United States, the singer proceeded to the UK where he sold out the popular O2 Arena in minutes. According to schedule, the rest of the tour was meant to take place in Canadian cities including Toronto, Ottawa, British Colombia, and others. The new Omicron variant of the COVID-19 Virus continues to generate public health concerns for countries due to its high transmissibility. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
