Super Eagles interim coach Austin Eguavoen says he is not desperate to equal late Stephen Keshi’s Africa Cup of Nations record. Keshi won the AFCON title as a player in 1994 and as a coach in 2013. His equaled Egyptian Mahmoud El Gohary’s record, who won the second edition of the tournament in 1959 as a player, before guiding the Pharaohs to their fourth title in 1998. “It’s not about the individual, it’s about the team, it’s about the country,” Eguavoen said in a pre-match conference on Monday. “I’m not looking at personal glory to say, ‘hey, listen, I want to be the coach alive to have won the Nations Cup as a player and as a coach.’ “I’m looking at what I can do for my country and leave a legacy. It’s not about the individual. It’s a collective thing.” On the players who opted out on the tournament, Eguaveon added,” We have to respect people’s opinions, but there are regulations to release players. “It boils down to the individual players. You have to fight for it. We also battle such when we were playing and we fought it because it’s a privilege and honour to play for your country.” Eguavoen will lead the Eagles out for the ninth time against Egypt at the Roumde Adjia Stadium on Tuesday (today) by 5pm.
