Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello, has endorsed the presidential aspiration of former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu. Bello, who received Tinubu in Minna on Thursday, applauded the will of the All Progressives Congress’ chieftain’s in changing Lagos to what it is today, adding that Nigeria needs a President with such vision. Bello said he wants the presidential aspirant to replicate the developmental strides at the national level. He said, “I am looking forward to seeing you lay the kind of foundation you laid for the massive transformation in Lagos for Nigeria. “Lagos is a country within a country and we saw the foundation you laid there, we are looking forward to seeing you replicate it for Nigeria.” Bello appreciated Tinubu, who donated N50m to the state for Internally Displaced Persons, for sympathising with the government and people over the incessant attacks in the state. Tinubu appealed to Nigerians not to see the current security challenges in the country as a hopeless situation. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
