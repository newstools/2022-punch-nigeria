The Defence Headquarters has warned politicians against wearing military uniforms and accoutrements for their campaign posters. It accused some state governors of being guilty of this, noting that they were wearing military uniforms in their campaign posters and displaying them at strategic places. In a statement on Wednesday by the acting Director, Defence Information, Air Commodore Wap Maigida, the military described such an act as illegal and an abuse of privilege. The statement was titled, ‘Wearing of military uniform by unauthorised persons and politicians for electioneering campaign posters is illegal’. It read, “The Defence Headquarters has noticed with dismay that some politicians have formed the habit of wearing military uniforms and accoutrements for campaign posters. “The campaign posters of some governors, dressed in military camouflage uniforms, are displayed in noticeable areas in their respective states. “This is manifestly illegal and an abuse of the privilege of allowing civilians to wear military uniforms during military training exercises. “It is necessary to restate that the Armed Forces of Nigeria, as a professional institution, remains apolitical and, as such, will not want to be dragged into any form of political bias.” He urged politicians and others to desist from the use of military uniforms and accoutrements for political events and other engagements henceforth. Maigida stressed that anyone found culpable would be liable to prosecution. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
