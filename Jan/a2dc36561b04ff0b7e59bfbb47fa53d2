A yet-to-be-identified lady said to be in her early 20s has been killed and her eyes removed by suspected cultists in Ogwashi-Uku, in the Aniocha North Local Government Area of Delta State. Community sources told our correspondent on Wednesday that the corpse was found by the roadside along Ubulu-Unor Road. “Some people who passed the road early Tuesday morning saw the corpse and raised the alarm and many people rushed down to see for themselves. “When we got there, we saw the girl wearing a pair of jean trousers and a white top. Her face was covered with blood and her two eyes were no more. You can see her eye sockets empty,” a source said. The source noted that community vigilantes called the police, who took the corpse to a morgue. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe, confirmed the incident.
