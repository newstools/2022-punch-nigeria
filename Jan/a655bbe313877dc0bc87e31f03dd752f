Two minors arrested for allegedly stabbing a Redeemed Christian Church of God’s pastor, Babatunde Dada, to death, will be arraigned on Wednesday, the Lagos State Police Command has said. Spokesperson for the Command, Adekunle Ajisebutu, on Tuesday, said the two suspects who claimed to be up-and-coming artistes would be arraigned at the Yaba Magistrate Court. “Be informed that the suspects arrested in connection with the murder of Babatunde Dada, pastor of the Redeemed Christians Church of God, Festac will be arraigned at the Yaba Magistrate Court tomorrow 12th January, 2022,” the PPRO said in a notice to reporters. The suspects, Farouk, 15, and Jamiu, 17, were recently paraded by the state Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu.
The minors were said to have attempted to dispossess the pastor of his valuables when they attacked him on the church premises in the Festac area of the state. Odumosu had said the suspects, after allegedly perpetrating the crime, fled to an unknown destination, adding that they were arrested in their hideouts in Ilorin, Kwara State, and Festac area. He had said, “The duo of Farouk, 15 and Jamiu, stabbed and killed one Babatunde Dada, 46, inside a church where he worshipped. The deceased/victim, until his death, was a pastor in the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Festac. “The suspects, after committing the murderous act, absconded to unknown places. However, following intensive and discreet investigation, the two culprits were arrested in their hideouts. The suspects during interrogation confessed to have killed the victim with a bottle and a stick. The exhibits used in perpetuating the dastardly act were recovered.” Copyright PUNCH.
