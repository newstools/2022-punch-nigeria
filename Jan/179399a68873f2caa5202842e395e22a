About two million households receive N5,000 monthly under the Conditional Cash Transfer programme anchored by the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, the Federal Government said on Thursday. It further stated that over 10 million Nigerian pupils were currently benefitting from the school feeding programme of the government being managed by the humanitarian ministry. The National Coordinator, National Social Investment Programme, Umar Bindr, stated this at the NSIP annual strategic review meeting in Abuja. He stated that while over 10 million households had applied for the N5,000 monthly support, the government had been able to capture about two million. He said, “We have more than 10 million applicants nationwide, but we have successfully managed to onboard two million, and we are consistently paying these households N5,000 per month. “The households have an average number of five to seven people.” On the school feeding, Bindr said, “We are feeding an average of 10 million children nationwide. By the end of 2021, there were only two states that were not onboarded, Kwara and Bayelsa. “But I’m happy to report that they are now aligned, so we are nationwide.” The NSIP coordinator, however, noted that some persons were trying to scuttle the programmes, as some individuals inflate figures mischievously. “There are reports whereby we see schools that don’t exist actually reported, we find this and we drop them,” he stated. Bindr added, “There are situations where schools, number of pupils in schools have been inflated, we caught those. Also, there are areas where the cooking is not taking place and then we are paying cooks. We also checkmate those. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
