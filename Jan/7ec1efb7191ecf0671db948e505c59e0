Nollywood star, Mercy Aigbe, has cleared the air concerning her new marriage as she claimed that her new lover, Adeoti Kazim, also known as Adekaz, and her ex-husband, Lanre gentry was never friends. She made this known on Wednesday in a message which she sent to the hosts of TVC talk show, Your View, where they discussed her new relationship. The topic for the show was ‘Nollywood actress Mercy Aigbe marries ex-husband’s friend’ and towards the end of the show, the actress called the main show host, Morayo Afolabi-Brown on the phone. Afolabi-Brown then announced that Aigbe was trying to call them on the show but as she couldn’t reach them, the actress has sent a text. “I just want to clear the impression, Adekaz isn’t Lanre Gentry’s friend,” Afolabi-Brown read out Aigbe’s text to the viewers of the show. Aigbe had set the internet agog on Sunday when she unveiled popular movie marketer, Adeoti, as her new lover. She also took to her Instagram page on Monday to shower praises on her new lover on his birthday. Aigbe’s estranged husband, Gentry, had shared a picture of himself, Aigbe, Adeoti, and Adeoti’s wife on his page as he revealed that the “truth” was finally out. The ace actress separated from her estranged husband in 2017 after she alleged that she suffered domestic violence in her marriage. Since their separation, the duo had frequently engaged in social media clashes since then. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
