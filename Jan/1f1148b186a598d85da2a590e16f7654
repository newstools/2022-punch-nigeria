The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission secured a total of 2,220 convictions across all its Commands in 2021. This is the highest conviction secured by the anti-graft agency since inception, a 127.5 per cent improvement from the 1,280 convictions recorded by the Agency in 2019. The figure, which emerged from a review of the Commission’s performance in the outgone year, shows that the Lagos Command of the Agency recorded the most convictions – 481, closely followed by the Ibadan Command with 324 convictions, while the Port Harcourt Zonal Command had 230 convictions. The EFCC, in a statement on Thursday, said “interestingly too, the 2220 record represents a 98.49 per cent success rate in prosecution as the Commission lost only 34 cases during this period. “Commenting on the performance, the Executive Chairman of the EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa, commended the personnel of the Commission for their industry and dedication despite the challenges of criminal prosecution in court. “He assured that the EFCC will continue to motivate all categories of staff for greater efficiency through capacity development and other incentives.” Copyright PUNCH.
