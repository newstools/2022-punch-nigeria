The Nigeria Labour Congress, Gombe State chapter, is mobilising its members and civil society organisations, to take part in the forthcoming protest against the Federal Government’s decision to remove fuel subsidy. The chairman of the chapter, Adamu Musa, told journalists at a briefing on Friday at the Labour House that the removal of fuel subsidy would subject Nigerians to more suffering. He assured that the NLC would do everything necessary to ensure the Federal Government reversed the decision. The NLC had fixed January 27 for its protest across the 36 states and the grand protest in Abuja over the planned fuel subsidy removal. “NLC is expecting compliance from the workers and members of CSOs to cooperate with their leadership and come out to participate peacefully without causing harm to anybody,” Adamu added. When asked about plans to ensure hitch-free protest, Adamu said the union had reached out to security agencies to ensure a peaceful protest.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
