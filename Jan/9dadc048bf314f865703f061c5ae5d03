The lawmaker representing Obokun/Oriade Federal Constituency, in the House of Representatives, Oluwole Oke, has called on the Senator representing East Senatorial District, Francis Fadahunsi, to mediate in the lingering crisis rocking Peoples Democratic Party in the district. Oke, in a release obtained in Osogbo on Monday, appealed to the warring groups in the party to sheathe their swords and allow peace to reign in the party. The lawmaker specifically called on Fadahunsi, who he described as the leader of the party, to mediate and return peace to the party. The statement read in part, “Senator Adenigba Fadahunsi is today by the grace of God the only PDP sitting Senator from Osun State and by this situation, the leader of PDP in Ife/Ijesa land and Osun state. “Senator Fadahunsi should act now by calling his feuding children together and settle the rift between them amicably. “For the first time in history we have both Osun State PDP Chairman, South-West Zonal Chairman, and PRO from Ijesaland, It’s a big plus for us. Let us put our house in order. All cases in court against PDP should be withdrawn.” But reacting, Segun Progress, media aide to Senator Fadahunsi, said his principal has been working to restore peace in PDP and challenged Oke to mention his contribution towards returning peace to PDP. Progress said, “Is Oke just discovering Fadahunsi is the PDP leader? Well, Fadahunsi has been meeting all stakeholders to return peace to PDP in Osun. But we challenge Oke to mention his contribution to the process of returning peace to Osun PDP.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
