An entrepreneur and pageant organiser, Konnie Agu, has said that her entertainment company, FunHub, was established to create fun moments for kids and families. According to her, the idea for the company was in response to the shortage of events in December for kids and other family members. Agu told Sunday Scoop, “We planned and executed the Miss Nigeria pageant, as well as some other awards and shows. I went ahead to conceptualise, plan and execute the Face of Okija event which was a corporate social responsibility event for Nestoil Group. After this project, the zeal to plan and execute my own events kept getting stronger.” Speaking about the programmes she held during the Yuletide, she said, “In December, we had our first event tagged ‘Christmas Funday’ at the Landmark Beach, Victoria Island, Lagos. For me, it was a dream come true. Starting out last year, I did not know the event would eventually hold as I kept pushing it forward. But with the smiles on the faces of attendees, I am glad it happened. “On several occasions, I felt like giving up on the idea. I gave myself many reasons to make me believe the time wasn’t right. With the tough economic situation in the country and hike in prices of almost everything, I cannot beat my chest to say it was financially worth it. But, because of the passion I have for kids and their families, it was more of a moral profit for me.” Recalling her experience as a pageant organiser, Agu said, “After many years of working with Folio Media Group to organise the Miss Nigeria pageant, and the Face of Okija Cultural Pageant and Talent Hunt, I find it fulfilling to be in a position to give young people opportunities for a new start.” Copyright PUNCH.
