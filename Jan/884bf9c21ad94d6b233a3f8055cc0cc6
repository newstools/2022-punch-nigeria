Ossai Success, an aide to the Governor of Delta State, Ifeanyi Okowa, has said celebrities are discouraging singles from getting married. In a post on Facebook, Success said this is due to the everyday break up of marriages involving celebrities, adding that they make the beautiful institution of marriage look like hell fire. He wrote, “Celebrities are discouraging singles from getting married because of their everyday marriage break up. “Honestly, marriage is beautiful and enjoyable but majority of our celebrities are really making it looks like hell fire. “Some of the singles out there are really having negative impression about marriage.” Reacting, one Facebook user, Onyinyechi Ukah said, “Honestly… And it’s too bad how marriage is now paint black. Singles be wise.” Akpomeh Oghenemaro wrote, “Marriage is as good as the people in it. Show me a good marriage and I will show you at least one or two good persons involve, show me a bad marriage and I will show you one or two bad persons involve. Marriage is not bad, it is people who are into the marriage that are bad.” Addy Sylv said, “Well said Ossai Ovie Success, I quite agree with you.
A lot of persons enter into marriage with unrealistic expectations. But the truth is that marriages can work if couples apply principles found in God’s word.” Debbie Peculiar, said, “I won’t lie, my greatest fear now is getting married to the wrong person. I’m not looking at the physical, if God says yes, who am I not to agree with him. There’s something called conviction. I will suggest our singles,male and female work on it and make honest decisions within themselves.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
