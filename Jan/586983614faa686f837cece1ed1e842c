The National Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, a subsidiary of the National Information Technology Development Agency, is partnering with Japan International Cooperation Agency to launch a startup incubation programme, called ‘iHatch’. The aim of the programme is to increase the number of innovation-driven enterprises by Nigerian youths, providing an excellent opportunity for startups with innovative business ideas alongside a prototype of their products or services, according to a statement by NITDA’s Head of Corporate Affairs and External Affairs, Mrs Hadiza Umar, on Friday. It said, “iHatch is a five-month free intensive incubation programme designed to help Nigerian entrepreneurs perfect their business ideas through a series of coaching, lectures, and boot camps, to generate viable and scalable business models. iHatch focuses on youth, innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology. “Participating startups will receive free offline and online interactive training from experienced coaches and mentors from over the world. Other benefits include free co-working space for the duration of the programme and investment opportunities.” The Director-General/Chief Executive Officer, NITDA, Kashifu Abdullahi, said, “iHatch seeks to establish a programme that will accelerate the process of taking ideas to impact, hence providing the much-needed jobs for our teeming youths, and also nurturing that entrepreneurial spirit in them, which will catalyse the Nigerian digital economy to the next level.” Copyright PUNCH.
