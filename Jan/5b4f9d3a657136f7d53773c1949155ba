The General Evangelist (Worldwide) of the Christ Apostolic Church, Prophet Samuel Abiara, on Saturday, told Nigerians, especially the people of Lagos State to shun those he described as ‘prophets of doom’. He gave the charge during the New Year service held simultaneously by Christian and Muslim faithful in Lagos House, Marina, at both the Chapel of Christ the King for Christian faithful and the State House Mosque. Abiara prayed for the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, his family, members of the State Executive Council and the state. He urged people not to listen to prophets of doom against Nigeria and her leaders at the national and state levels. “Don’t listen to prophets of doom against Nigeria, our nation and the leaders. Don’t listen to prophets of doom against Lagos State. The future of Nigeria and Lagos State is bright,” Prophet Abiara declared.
