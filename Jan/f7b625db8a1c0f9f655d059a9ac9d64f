The National Union of Road Transport Workers has disassociated its members from the mayhem that happened at Diamond Hotel, Ibadan, Oyo State during which some policemen were injured. Reacting to a report which linked the NURTW with the breakdown of law and order that took place in the hotel, the chairman of the union, Prof. Tajudeen Baruwa, in a statement on Sunday, urged members of the public to stop confusing NURTW with Oyo State-owned Park Management Services. Baruwa said, “It is on record that the Oyo State Government in 20I9, despite appeals from the leadership of Nigeria Labour Congress and well-meaning Nigerians, proscribed our union in the state. The government then inaugurated Park Management Services and one Mukaila Lamidi (Auxiliary) was appointed as the chairman “Since 2019, PMS has been usurping our duties, activities and functions in Oyo State. It is, therefore, appalling and provocative to be linking our union to any illegality perpetrated by Mukaila Lamidi (Auxiliary)-led PMS in Oyo State.” The NURTW boss said the union would not hesitate to initiate legal action against any media house that continues to confuse PMS with NURTW. “NURTW is not operating in Oyo State and our union will no longer condone a situation whereby some people will be destroying our name and image,” he said.
