British-Nigerian singer, Shady Blue, has said that even though she has not revealed that she has not recouped her investment in her music career despite releasing some songs which enjoyed favourable airplay. However, she noted that she cannot quit because music is like a drug for her. She told Sunday Scoop, “It is not the most talented in music that succeeds. Music is a part of my life. I do it for the passion, not money. I have never made me profit from my music. As a matter of fact, my music career has cost me a lot of money. I have a regular job. Music doesn’t pay me, I pay music. I see music as my drug. I don’t drink or smoke. Music is the biggest risk of my life. Shady Blue also stated that she came to Nigeria to record live versions of seven out of the 15 tracks she has released so far. She added, “I heard the voice of God telling me to do that (live versions of the songs) immediately and that is why I’m in Nigeria at this time. God speaks to me a lot. I need to dig deeper to see what God wants for me. It could be scary because it may not be the direction I want to go but I have got to the point where I’m surrendering all to God.” Speaking on what inspires her songs, Aboderin said, “Real life scenarios inspire my songs. I like people to be able to relate to my music. Music is my ‘happy place’. It is where I go when everything is going wrong. The last time I was in Nigeria, I was diagnosed with cancer. However, when I got back (to the United Kingdom), by God’s grace, I did not even have to do the surgery. I only went for a biopsy and it (the cancer) disappeared.” Copyright PUNCH.
