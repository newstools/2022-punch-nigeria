Twitter has verified the Twitter account of Super Eagles Interim Manager, Augustine Eguavoen. The official handle of the team, @NGSuperEagles, celebrated the verification on Friday. The verification is coming about seven months after the coach joined the platform. Eguavoen-led Nigerian team have been outstanding at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations. Nigeria had eased into the Round of 16 as group leaders, with a match to spare, courtesy of the wins over Egypt and Sudan in their two matches and the combination of other results, notably Egypt’s defeat of Guinea Bissau on Saturday. Despite that, the team defeated Guinea Bissau 2-0 to record 100 per cent victory in their group stage. Eguavoen, 56, is the only man to have coached Nigeria to win all three matches in the group phase of the AFCON since the country started participating at this level since 1963. He was head coach when the Eagles defeated Ghana 1-0, Zimbabwe 2-0 and Senegal 2-1 at the Al Masry Stadium, Port Said to sweep the stakes at the 2006 finals. In 14 previous matches across three stints, the 1994 AFCON winner and two-time FIFA World Cup defender has left the field victorious in 12 matches, losing only two – the 0-1 defeat to Cote d’Ivoire in the semi final of the 2006 finals and a 2012 AFCON qualifier in Guinea that was embroiled in circumstances of uncertainty, which the team lost by the odd goal.
