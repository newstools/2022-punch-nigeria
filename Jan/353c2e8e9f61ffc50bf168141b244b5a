The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has extended heartfelt condolences to a former deputy governor of Osun State, Iyiola Omisore, and the entire Omisore family on the passing of their father and Olu of Ayepe-Olode, Oba Omisore. This is as he said the late monarch would be remembered for his lifelong dedication to the development of his people. Buhari’s condolence message is contained in a statement signed on Monday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, titled, ‘President Buhari mourns Oba Omisore, father of ex-Osun Deputy Gov’. According to Adesina, “The President joins the people of Ife in mourning the well-respected traditional ruler, who will be remembered for his lifelong dedication to the development of his people, providing leadership with dignity, love and respect when it mattered most.” Buhari said he trusts that the Omisore family, friends and associates will continue to honour the departed patriarch’s avowed commitment to peaceful settlement of disputes and promoting harmony among different ethnic groups. He, therefore, prayed for the peaceful repose of the departed and comfort for those who mourn. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
