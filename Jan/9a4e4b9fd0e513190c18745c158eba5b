Veteran actress and preacher, Eucharia Anunobi, on Monday said that those who buy ‘aso ebi’ for parties are wasting the monetary blessings that God has given them. She made this known during a sermon on her Instagram page, where she admonished her followers against spending money unnecessarily. The preacher, who hoes by the title ‘Apostle’, noted that people should wear what thye have when going to parties rather than buy ‘aso ebi’ and “waste” God’s blessings. Anunobi said, “It is not a must to wear ‘aso ebi’. It is not a must to buy that uniform. If you’re invited to that party, whatever you have in your wardrobe, please wear it and go. “Because if you calculate how much money you spend on all those ‘aso ebi’ and those uniforms, you will see that you’re wasting a lot of monetary blessings that God gives to you.” Watch video below:  Copyright PUNCH.
