The Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has mourned the passing of former Secretary to the Lagos State Government, Princess Adenrele Adeniran-Ogunsanya, who died on Tuesday after a brief illness. Adeniran-Ogunsanya, who died aged 74, was the Lagos SSG during the first term in office of former Governor Babatunde Fashola between 2007 and 2011. In a statement signed by Sanwo-Olu’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Gboyega Akosile, on Tuesday, the governor mourned the former SSG, stating that her death was a big loss to the state. Sanwo-Olu said, “On behalf of the Government and people of Lagos State, I want to express my sincere and heartfelt sympathy to the family, friends and political associates of the late Secretary to the Lagos State Government (SSG), Princess Adenrele Adeniran-Ogunsanya. “The death of Princess Adenrele Adeniran-Ogunsanya is a big loss to Lagos State. She made a lot of positive impacts and contributions during her lifetime to the growth and development of Lagos State as SSG. She also made a significant impact in Lagos politics when as a member of the ruling party, especially in Ikorodu. “I pray that God will grant Princess Adenrele Adeniran-Ogunsanya eternal rest and give the immediate family, friends, political associates and the people of Ikorodu the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.” Copyright PUNCH.
