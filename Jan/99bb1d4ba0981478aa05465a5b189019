Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, is said to have offered logistics and other supports to the Nigerian Army in the ongoing war against Boko Haram insurgents without being asked by the military authorities. The acting General Officer Commanding 7 Division of the Nigerian Army, Major General Abdulwahab Eyitayo, made the assertion on Sunday. Eyitayo spoke during Zulum’s visit to the headquarters of the 7 Division of the Nigerian Army in Maiduguri, during an event organised by the Army to celebrate the acting GOC’s recent promotion to the rank of a Major General. He said, “Severally without being prompted, you (Zulum) come to our aide to support us even in terms of logistics. “Through your persistence and unrelenting cooperation and assistance, you have one way or the other, turned the spirit of the soldiers into fighting machine.” Zulum, in his response, congratulated the acting GOC and other recently-promoted officers. The governor said personnel of the military and other security agencies deserved to be supported and encouraged. He described their duties as tough, hence the need for the support.  Copyright PUNCH.
