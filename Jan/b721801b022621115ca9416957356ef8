Nollywood actress, Nkechi Blessing Sunday, has revealed that she sold her Range Rover in 2021 to enable her complete her house project. The light-skinned actress took to her Instagram page to share a picture of herself in front of the edifice, as she stated that she was happy about making the decision. She wrote, “The best decision I made in 2021 was selling my Range Rover to complete this beauty behind me. Thank God for the space bus I bought for my mum. Shey landlady for Dey trek by now. “It’s 2022. Try to set your priorities right.  A car is never an achievement but a necessity; a means of transporting you from one place to another. “This is my own opinion and I did not call for a debate. Choose whatever works for you please. Just saying respectfully.” The actress had announced the completion of her house last month. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
