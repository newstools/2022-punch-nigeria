The Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, on Monday, pledged to support the new Minister of State for Works and Housing, Mu’azu Sambo, to enable him to succeed in his assignment in the interest of the state and the nation. Ishaku, who was speaking at the reception organised in honour of the minister in Jalingo, expressed happiness over his appointment. Represented by the State Commissioner for Works and Transport, Ibrahim Hammanjulde, Ishaku urged the people of the state, irrespective of political affiliations, to support the minister. Earlier, the Taraba State Chairman of the All Progressive Congress, Ibrahim El-Suldi, thanked the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for Sambo’s appointment. El-Suldi described Sambo as a first-class engineer, saying he would perform well as the Minister of State for Works and Housing, even as he called on the people of the state to support and pray for the minister to succeed in his assignment in the service of Nigeria. Responding, Sambo thanked the people of Taraba for the reception and pledged to represent the state well in his assignment. According to him, Buhari has remained the only President in Nigerian history that has invested heavily in infrastructural development. “With the help of the President and other alternative avenues for infrastructure financings, we will make an impact in the remaining 17 months of the administration,” he said.
