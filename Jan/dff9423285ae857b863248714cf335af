The Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has invited all the other 35 Governors to a “very crucial meeting where pressing national concerns will be discussed.” The meeting is slated for 8:00 pm on Wednesday, January 19, 2022, at the NGF Secretariat in Abuja. The Head, Media and Public Affairs, Nigeria Governors’ Forum Secretariat, Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, disclosed this in a statement signed on Saturday titled ‘NGF Meeting’. According to an invitation issued by the Director-General of the Forum, Asishana Okauru, and sent to all the respective Governors, the meeting, which is the first in 2022, will be in-person as opposed to virtual. This, he said, is to effectively convey the messages of the meeting which are all characterised under the second item of the agenda titled ‘matters arising.’ To also feature prominently are the interventions programs such as the regular updates from the Nigeria Governors’ Forum State Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability Program team and another on Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security as well as others. The NGF Chairman, accompanied by all the 36 Governors, will thereafter address a press conference. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
