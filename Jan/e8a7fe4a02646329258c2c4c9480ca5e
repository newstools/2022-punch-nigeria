The Niger State chapter of the Nigeria Union of Teachers has ordered its members to sit at home indefinitely until the state government stop the payment of salaries on percentage basis to teachers in the state. The union’s position was contained in a letter jointly signed by its Chairman, Muhammad Khaliel; and the Secretary, Jimada Yusuf, titled ‘Sit at Home’ and made available to our correspondent in Minna, the state capital, on Sunday. The union vowed not to allow the government to continue to take teachers for granted by continuously paying them their salaries on percentage. The letter ordered teachers to sit at home until the government responds to their demand and stop paying salaries on percentage. The letter read, “Consequent upon the continuous payment of teachers salary in percentage, you are hereby directed to shun the resumption date and remain at home indefinitely. “The union shall remain resolute in the fight to better the welfare of its members. “We encourage you to go about your lawful activities and await further directives from the union.” According to the leadership of the union, teachers in the state have been faced with a lot of untold hardship owing to the state government’s decision of paying on percentage. Public schools in the state are expected to resume on Monday (today). The decision of the teachers to stay at home may however alter the second term academic calendar.  Copyright PUNCH.
