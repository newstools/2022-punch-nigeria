The Nigeria Immigration Services Comptrollers in charge of eight different locations in the North-West are currently meeting in Katsina to, among others, restrategise on how to tackle porous borders in the affected locations. Also to be discussed is the issue of human trafficking. The locations include Illela, Sokoto, Jigawa, Zamfara, Kano, Kaduna, Katsina, and Jibia special border. They all form Zone “B” of the NIS. The NIS Assistant Comptroller General in charge of the zone, Zainab Lawal, made the revelation on Wednesday evening shortly after she arrived in Katsina for the meeting. She noted that the meeting was meant to “strategise and rejig the service amidst the existing illegal routes in the region.” Lawal said, “We are here for the zonal meeting. Normally, it is rotational. We have been to other states in the zone and now is the turn of Jibia Special Border, but we are going to have it here in Katsina; that is why you see all my Comptrollers in the zone here. “Part of why we are here is because this zone has numerous borders, so we are here to strategise to know the way forward.” The NIS boss had earlier on her arrival commissioned the newly constructed official residence for the Katsina Command Comptroller. It was further learnt that the comptroller in charge of each location is expected to make a presentation on how to tackle methods being used by illegal immigrants to enter Nigeria and also on the activities of human traffickers. The meeting which kicks off this morning (Thursday) ends on Friday. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
