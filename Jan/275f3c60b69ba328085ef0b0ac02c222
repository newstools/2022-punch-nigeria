A talent manager and publicist, Mayowa Adenekan, aka Mayorspeaks, has said that for one to successful manage an artiste, one must believe in the person’s craft. Speaking on what it takes to groom an artiste from the scratch, Adenekan told Sunday Scoop, “Many talent managers run away from up-and-coming artistes because they would have to start from the scratch to groom and market the brand. However, from my experience working with the skit maker, Kiekie, and some others, I have come to the realisation that one of the most important parts of grooming a successful artiste is by believing in their talent. When a manager believes in their artiste’s craft, it would be easier to sell the brand.” Mayorspeaks also noted that many artistes do not consider a manager’s track record before employing the person. He said, “A manager is supposed to represent the artiste in public, build relationships and make long-term plans for the artiste’s future. However, in choosing managers, many artistes don’t check the past experience of the person they are entering into a contract with. Some managers have a history of keeping double standards which tends to impair their objectivity towards helping the artistes they represent get to the zenith of their careers.” Asked how talent managers could be better appreciated in Nigeria, he said, “In this business, one’s reputation and experience are everything. One builds one’s reputation on one’s ability to maintain and build meaningful business relationships with both artistes and industry professionals. The more successful the artistes one manages, the more one becomes influential.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
