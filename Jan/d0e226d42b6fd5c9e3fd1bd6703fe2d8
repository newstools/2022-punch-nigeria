The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, is a wise choice that should not elude Nigeria’s 2023 presidency. The governor said this on Thursday during the inauguration of the working committee of the Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu Movement, in Ikeja GRA. He said, “Our convergence here is to raise foot soldiers, converts, team leader, cheer leaders and have over 1,500 committed  men that are drawn, first from our 57 local government and local council development areas and 377 wards across the nook and cranny of Lagos. “Let us go out there and encourage our people to vote for who will succeed President Muhammadu Buhari, who would continue from where he will stop next year and put in the work required to make Nigeria a truly unstoppable force among nations. “That person has to be a detribalised Nigerian who has contacts all over the land and believes in the unity of our people and in their ability to surmount all challenges. He must be a thoroughbred democrat who respects the ideals of true federalism, and above all, he must be a tested and trusted manager of men and that person is Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. He is a wise choice that must not elude Nigeria in 2023.” The Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Dr Mudashiru Obasa, said ABAT would be a strong new movement. “Today we have given birth to a new political movement that will be like Afenifere and the Justice Forum and this is the ABAT movement and we have roles to play to nurture, sustain, protect and spread its message far and wide to support our father, teacher and mentor, Bola Tinubu,” he said.
