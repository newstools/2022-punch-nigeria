Egypt national team General Manager, Wael Gomaa, has apologised to fans of the Pharaohs for the team’s disappointing performance against Nigeria in their Africa Cup of Nations Group D opener. Kelechi Iheanacho’s 30th-minute wonder strike was enough to earn the Eagles a win at the Stade Roumde Adjia, Garoua on Tuesday. Austin Eguavoen’s team were the better side as they dominated proceedings for the entire 90 minutes. The defeat marked Egypt’s first AFCON opener defeat since 2002, when they lost 1-0 to Senegal 1-0 their first group stage defeat, when they fell to Algeria in Tunisia in the 2004 edition. The game was completely one-sided as Nigeria dictated and controlled the rhythm of the match, much to the disappointment of the North African fans. After the game, Gomaa tendered an apology through the Egyptian Football Association’s official Twitter account. “I’d like to apologise to Egyptian fans for the defeat against Nigeria, especially with the poor performance in the first half,” Gomaa said. “We will not take the situation lightly, and everyone is taking responsibility. “The defeat was a lesson, and we have to learn from it, we have two more games where we will do everything to collect the six points in order to keep the title dream alive.” Up next for Nigeria is a showdown with Sudan on Saturday and a win will send the three-time African champions to the knockout stages as Egypt seek their first victory of the tournament.
