Movie Director, Moses Inwang, on Wednesday shared behind-the-scene videos of the staged fight between Nollywood actors, Jim Iyke and Uche Maduagwu. Inwang shared these as Maduagwu revealed that Iyke paid him N4.8m to pull a stunt on the public in order to promote his movie, Bad Comments. This came after Iyke had revealed that he paid Maduagwu to beat him(Maduagwu) in a video that went viral last year. Iyke had in August 2021 beat Maduagwu up for questioning his source of wealth. The video went viral at that time. The actor in a recent interview had mentioned that the beating was orchestrated and that he paid Maduagwu after they reached an agreement. Taking to his Instagram page, the director of the stunt shared behind-the-scenes videos of the staged fight. Inwang captioned the videos, “Na me direct that fight.”(sic) See videos below:  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
