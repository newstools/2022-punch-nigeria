Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has mourned the death of the former Presidential candidate of the defunct National Republican Convention in the June 12, 1993 election, Alhaji Bashir Othman Tofa, saying his contributions to Nigeria’s democracy remained indelible. In a statement signed by the commissioner for Information, Muhammad Garba, the governor noted the sacrifices of Tofa, who started taking up leadership responsibilities at an early age, when he was elected councillor, in his late 20s. He had remained vibrant and dynamic up till the time of his death. He said as a businessman, trader and philanthropist, Tofa touched the lives of many people, especially the down-trodden, and he expressed the belief that the legacies of the deceased will be approximated for posterity. “The legacy of his political beliefs and triumphs will be important footnotes in the literature of Nigeria’s government and politics for generations yet to come. “He was a great man, a quintessential democrat and outstanding statesman who has left very hold prints both on the politics and political history of Nigeria,” the statement added. The governor prayed Almighty Allah to grant his soul rest, as well as the fortitude for his family, friends and associates to bear the irreparable loss. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
