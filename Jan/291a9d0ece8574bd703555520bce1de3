Super Eagles defender, Leon Balogun, says he’s delighted midfielder, Joe Aribo, has been able to replicate his club form with the national team at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Aribo has been instrumental to the team’s impressive performance in the middle of the pack in the Eagles first two games of the campaign. He provided the assist for Kelechi Iheanacho to score the winner in their opening 1-0 win over Egypt last Tuesday. He also had a commanding performance against Sudan on Saturday partnering, Wilfred Ndidi in midfield. He has been deployed in the deep-lying midfield role and Balogun believes he can perform better for the team if he is played in his most preferred position as a central midfielder or in the support striker position. “I’ve always known he’s a great player, right from the time I started playing with him. He’s in great form this season and he managed to bring that to Nigeria in the last two games,” Balogun said in a post-match Instagram live video. “To me, he’s not playing in his best position. If you put him in as a No.10 he will give you more joy because he knows how to take on players, he knows how to delay the play in a way. “However, I’m happy he’s found a way to bring his form to the national team because I think people have been waiting for long for him to actually replicate the kind of form he has at club level. So, I’m actually happy he’s found a way to do it in a different position,” Balogun added. Aribo has been in form for Glasgow Rangers in the ongoing season scoring six goals while providing five assists in 32 games across all competitions for the Gers. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
