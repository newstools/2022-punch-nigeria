The Lagos State Government says it has paid N81m to families of deceased civil servants in the state. The Commissioner for Finance, Dr Rabiu Olowo, said this in a statement on Sunday. Olowo, who was represented by the ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Mr Temitope Hundogan, was quoted to have said this while presenting the cheques to the beneficiaries. He said, “The objective of the payment of insurance death benefits is to provide succour for the immediate families, dependants and other beneficiaries of the deceased as part of the welfare package for the state’s workforce. “The state government commiserates with these families and it is further committed to ensuring that this is done regularly as today’s presentation of N81m covers the year 2020 to 2021.” One of the beneficiaries, Mr Adekunle Ajibodu, thanked the government for implementing the death insurance benefits. “The Lagos State government is number one in taking care of the workforce”, he said.
