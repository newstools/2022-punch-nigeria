United States veteran singer and actor, Meat Loaf, has died at the age of 74. This was announced in a statement on his official Facebook page in the very early hours Friday, where his family revealed that he was surrounded by his family during his death. The statement read, “Our hearts are broken to announce that the incomparable Meat Loaf passed away tonight surrounded by his wife Deborah, daughters Pearl and Amanda and close friends. “His amazing career spanned 6 decades that saw him sell over 100 Million albums worldwide and star in over 65 movies, including “Fight Club”, “Focus”, “Rocky Horror Picture Show” and “Wayne’s World.” “Bat Out of Hell remains one of the top 10 selling albums of all time. We know how much he meant to so many of you and we truly appreciate all of the love and support as we move through this time of grief in losing such an inspiring artist and beautiful man. “We thank you for your understanding of our need for privacy at this time. From his heart to your souls, don’t ever stop rocking!” Born Marvin Aday, the singer gained prominence in the late 1970s due to his vocal prowess both in the studio and on stage. He was also one of the few major US musicians to support the Republican Party and campaign for Mitt Romney in the 2012 election, which Barack Obama ended up winning. Copyright PUNCH.
