Nollywood actress, Uche Jombo, on Saturday said that many people have been enslaved mentally by pastors. The actress took to her Twitter page to also note that the focus of christians should be ok knowing and worshipping God. “Many people are enslaved mentally by pastors when the focus should be knowing and worshiping God,” Jombo tweeted. A fan, @nnamdichikee, replied saying, “Pastors help them to know, understand and worship god.” In response, the actress told the fan to read the tweet slowly. “Read the tweet again slowly,” she advised the follower. In another tweet, the actress talked about how women scriptwriters create “horrible weak” female characters. According to her, with such an act, the writer has missed a teachable moment about the female gender. “I hate when women write horrible weak female characters as a standard. Like, what is the reason to miss a teachable moment about your own gender?” Jombo questioned. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
