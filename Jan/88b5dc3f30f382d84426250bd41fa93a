The Lagos State Government has urged labour leaders in the state to promote harmony by working with government officials to ensure service delivery. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Labour and Industrial Relations, Babatunde Williams, made this call in a statement on Sunday. Williams was quoted to have said this at a three-day retreat organised by the Ministry of Establishments, Training and Pensions for labour leaders. He said, “This is an annual event organised for union leaders to network, socialise and engage in productive interaction with government officials with the objective of creating a symbiotic bond and promoting industrial harmony in the state. “Let me reiterate that the administration of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu is labour-friendly and committed to ensuring excellent service delivery to the good people of Lagos State through a well-motivated and competent work force.” The Head of Service, Mr Hakeem Muri-Okunola, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Pubic Service Office, Mr Segun Ajibade, said labour unions play a crucial role in the state’s development. “The role of labour unions in the development of the state is crucial because union members are the representatives of the entire workforce in Lagos State. Therefore, we urge union leaders not to fight for their members alone but to also advise the government on key areas for development,” he said. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
