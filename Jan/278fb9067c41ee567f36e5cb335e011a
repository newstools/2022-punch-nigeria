Sharing a picture of her husband, she wrote, “Omoniyi Oko mi I celebrate you, my happiness, my companion, my team player, my ginger, my lover and best friend. My gossip partner made for me. “God bless the day I met you. It has been years filled with so much fun, good days, oh yes bad days too( A lot worse days too). But in all, you remain the kind, loving and courageous man that you are. Every day, I bless God for giving me my own companion. You have grown and changed in so many ways and I thank God it is for good. Your wife is so proud of you.” She noted that despite her husband’s hard working nature, stubbornness, and creativity, he still loved his family. “His manly ego sometimes needs coconut water to calm it down. Above all, he loves his family. “Happy birthday to the king of my heart! May this year be the best yet seen in good health and prosperity. It is our season of enthronement.” Yomi Casual and his wife got married in October 2017 and three months later, they welcomed their daughter, Khaley, in Atlanta, United States.
