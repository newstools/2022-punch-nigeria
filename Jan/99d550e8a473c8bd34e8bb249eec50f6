American Hollywood star, Macaulay Culkin, has engaged his actress girlfriend of four years, Brenda Song. This comes months after the couple welcomed their first baby together in April 2021. The Home Alone star and the Dollface actress, who started dating in 2017 are ready to make it official, a close source revealed to E! News. Song, 33, has also confirmed the news on Tuesday, January 25, when she stepped out of Beverly Hills with a visible diamond ring on her finger. When the couple welcomed their son, they named him Dakota, after Culkin’s late sister. The stars, who said they were overjoyed over their new baby, had kept the pregnancy out of the spotlight at that time. Even after the delivery, the 40-year-old actor and his fiancee had kept their son away from social media. This would be Culkin’s second marriage as he had earlier married actress Rachel Miner in 1998, but they divorced after four years. Culkin had also previously dated Mila Kunis for eight years but their relationship ended in 2011. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
