Some retired soldiers have stormed the Headquarters of the Ministry of Finance in Abuja to demand the immediate payment of their pension arrears. The retired soldiers under the aegis of Coalition for Concerned Veterans accused the government of owing them 24 months arrears of the approved minimum wage for military veterans, debarment allowance, among others. The leader of the group, Abiodun Durowaiye-Herberts, said they had embarked on the protest as a result of the untold hardship and clear neglect of members by the authorities. He lamented that despite serving the country with all their might to ensure the country remains united, peaceful and free they are being subjected to such treatment. Durowaiye-Herberts vowed that the group would continue with the protest until their demands are met. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
