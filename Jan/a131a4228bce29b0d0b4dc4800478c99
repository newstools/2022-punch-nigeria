The President of the Healthcare Providers Association of Nigeria, Dr Jimmy Arigbabuwo, has said 76.6 per cent of Nigerians pay for their health care service out-of-pocket. Arigbabuwo, in an interview with our correspondent, said the association planned to implement new tariffs for Healthcare Maintenance Organisations from January 31. He said the old tariffs were no longer sustainable and would not guarantee quality health care service for the people. “We are withdrawing the old tariffs for the HMOs to implement our new tariffs effective from January 31. The HMOs have been coming around, trying to fix meetings and discussions and we’ve told them our door is opened. There is no crime in discussing; all that is important is for us to have an agreement. We may need to involve the NHIS as an arbiter. “If we have 76.6 per cent of Nigerians paying out-of-pocket, it is a disaster. There is no doubt that it is not a good thing in health care financing. Simple malaria can gulp all the earnings of a family away in a month, especially if it is complicated malaria. Out-of-pocket payment, to us, we see it as a crime as health care providers and it is not good for the system. “For instance, if somebody is involved in an accident and comes to my clinic, even without bringing a dime, I can’t drive the person back; I have to save the life. If we now say we want to do health insurance, we must do it in a way that it will be a win-win situation for the patients, the HMOs and the providers,” Arigbabuwo added.  Copyright PUNCH.
