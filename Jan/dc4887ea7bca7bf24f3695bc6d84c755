The Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Peoples Democratic Party, Walid Jibrin, on Wednesday, inaugurated the newly-constructed Dambam General Hospital, constructed by the Bauchi State government at the cost of N330 million. Speaking while inaugurating the project, Jibrin commended the state governor, Bala Mohammed, for his achievements in various sectors since his assumption of office in 2019. He said, “I believe Bauchi State will never go backwards again. I want to appeal to the people of Bauchi State to give the governor their maximum support and cooperation always. “It is my belief that this hospital that we are inaugurating today will not only be a place of treatment of the sick, but a centre for training nurses and midwives. I hope that in future, it will be a centre for training of young doctors. “I commend Bauchi State governor for providing this hospital for the improvement of the health of the state, believing that this hospital will meet the needs of the people of Bauchi by curing many diseases. The hospital should be a reference for other hospitals and clinics throughout the country.” The governor said 10 residential houses were also built for the doctors and health workers along with the edifice.
