The Segun Oni Campaign Organisation has rejected the results of the Peoples Democratic Party governorship primary election held on Wednesday in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State. A statement signed by Mr Yemi Arokodare, the Director-General of the Organisation, on Thursday in Ado-Ekiti, alleged that members of the organisation were disenchanted by the process. Governor Emmanuel Udom of Akwa Ibom who presided over the election, had declared Mr Bisi Kolawole, an anointed candidate of former Governor Ayodele Fayose, as the winner of the election, having polled 671 votes to beat Oni, his closest rival, who scored 330 votes. Arokodare alleged that the delegates’ register was mutilated and many delegates’ names were missing from the register. According to him, 32 automatic delegates who were accredited were not given tags and were not allowed to vote. Arokodare said Udom also allegedly threatened to arrest and lock all of these delegates if any of them should come into the hall. The organisation’s boss also alleged that Udom deliberately allowed Ayo Fayose, who allegedly heads a faction of Ekiti State PDP, to sit in the hall even after he has voted, a situation which is against the rules earlier pronounced by Udom. According to him, Udom allowed aides of Fayose to sit in the hall purposely to intimidate other delegates. Arokodare alleged further that Ayo Fayose was the chairman of Udom election committee in Akwa Ibom and that the January 26 PDP primary election was a payback for Ayo Fayose. He concluded that the primary was not free and fair. Arokodare said the Campaign Organisation, in view of the development, is in the process of reviewing the activities of the national leadership of the PDP towards managing the party to a success in the coming June 18 Governorship Election in Ekiti State.
