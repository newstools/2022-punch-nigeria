The Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Chief Gani Adams, has called on the President, Maj. Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to ensure that the 1999 Constitution was replaced with a new one before the 2023 general elections. The National Coordinator of Oodua Peoples Congress, who also asked Buhari to restructure the country before the next general election, insisted the task was achievable if the President wanted it done. Adams, while speaking with The PUNCH in Ile-Ife at the grand finale of this year’s edition of Oduduwa Festival on Monday, also said anyone pushing for an election with the current system of government in the country, should be called ‘political criminal.’ He said, “Constitution amendment should come before the 2023 general elections. I will neither dissuade them from holding the election nor criticise them because the vacuum must be filled in 2023. But for us to move forward as a country, we must restructure into regions. “If we don’t do that, I strongly believe that no matter who is elected to that seat, he will not achieve anything with the current constitution. Immediately you vote him in, he will be careful to tamper with the constitution. Buhari is going now, he has a little time to correct the system from what it is today. “He should call the parliament and stakeholders to amend the Constitution to the model of 1960 and 1963 so that Nigeria can move forward.” Adams called on Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, to reach out to the governors of South-West states and demand a work-free day for the celebration of Oduduwa, the progenitor of the race.
