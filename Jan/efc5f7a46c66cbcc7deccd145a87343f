The Edo State Government has unveiled plans to set up investment desks in Lagos and Abuja as well as Nigerian embassies overseas to attract investments to the state’s industrial, agriculture, retail, tourism, and power sectors. The Governor, Godwin Obaseki, gave the directive for setting up and operating the desks to the Edo State Investment Promotion Office, according to a statement. According to him, the state is ready to welcome investors with incentives and business support packages comparable to anywhere else in the world. He said, “We have to set up investment desks in Lagos and Abuja. This will increase the visibility of the opportunities for investment in our state. We need to get the word out for the incentives we have in the state. “The state has a 40MW power facility for investors in the industrial park provided by Ossiomo Power. We are providing support for the establishment of industries in the state and would like to attract investors from outside the state and the country.” The governor said the reforms undertaken in the state so far were geared towards ensuring a stable business climate that would fit the requirements for big-ticket investments. According to him, the state is already playing host to foreign businesses at the Utesi industrial corridor, and space and support structures are being created to accommodate more. “We want to create the investment desks so that we can advertise the opportunities available in the state to investors and get them to come and invest in our state,” he added.
