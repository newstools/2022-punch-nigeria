The Lagos State Police Command has said that a combined team of police and other security agents has been deployed to Idumota and its environs on Lagos Island to quell the gang fight that erupted in the neighbourhood on Thursday. It was learnt that two factional hoodlums popularly known as area boys clashed in the area around 12pm on Thursday, forcing several traders at the bustling commercial centre to abruptly shut down their shops. Videos of the clash went viral on Friday, with one of the clips showing a bloodied youth being carried away in a wheelbarrow. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, CSP Adekunle Ajisebutu, told our correspondent that normalcy had returned to the community. He said, “The police have quelled the crisis. Sufficient facilities were deployed in the area immediately we received a distress call and normalcy was restored. As we speak, the place is calm. I can’t confirm if any arrest was made for now or the cause of the fight. Investigation is ongoing.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
