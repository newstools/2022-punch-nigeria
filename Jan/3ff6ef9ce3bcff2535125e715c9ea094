The founder of a digital capacity building outfit, Learntor, Mrs Mercy George-Ibaje, has stressed the need for women to embrace technology, saying this will help bridge the digital skill gap in Nigeria. George-Ibaje, at a briefing in Lagos on Thursday, said there was the need for women to focus on technology to meet the present societal requirement. She noted that the Women in Agile conference scheduled to hold between January 27 and 29 would seek to bridge the digital skill gap in the country. “There are more than 230 million jobs available globally in the digital industry, but lack of needed skills is denying Nigerians, especially youths and women access. “Our aim is to create awareness, exploring innovative opportunities for Africans by advancing Agile values and principles, creating a safe space for networking, developing new skills, sharing ideas and flourishing together,” George-Ibafe said. She added that the conference would witness 85 speakers from 18 countries and would be streamed in French, Portuguese and English languages. The President of Junior Chambers International, Mr Wale Bakare, said its collaboration with Learntor would help expose more youths to necessary digital skills. “Technology is fast evolving and it is important to help people skill up and secure relevant jobs existing today,” he said.
