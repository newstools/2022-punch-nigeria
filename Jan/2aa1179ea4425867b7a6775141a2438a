The Lagos Government has said it will sponsor divisional youth ambassadors on leadership training in Chicago. The Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Mr Olusegun Dawodu, said this on Tuesday in a statement issued by the Director of  Public Affairs in the ministry, Mrs Olabisi Adeola. He said, “The state’s readiness to send 10 young leaders including the state ambassador, the divisional ambassadors and some other youths in the state to a leadership and capacity building training programme in Chicago is one of the commitments of the state government to further build their capabilities of our youth and transform them from local champions to global citizens that can compete favourably with their peers from any part of the world. “The programme is organised by World Chicago in conjunction with Silec Initiatives Nigeria, in order to offer young leaders, the opportunity to participate in diverse activities on the international exchange including volunteer activities, participating in international conferences, events and forums.” The commissioner added that the platform would promote an exchange of ideas and traditions among the youths. “The participants had been trained at the 2021/2022 Ibile youth academy as well as the transformational leadership programmes, organised by the Ministry of Youth and Social Development, where they were taken through different leadership topics and tasks,” he said.
