The Commissioner for Waterfront Infrastructure Development, Ahmed Abdullahi, has said the ongoing water jetties projects will boost the state’s transport system when completed. Abdullahi said this in a statement on Monday during his assessment tour of ongoing jetties across the state. He said, “When the Mile 2 jetty is completed, it will boost the multi-modal transportation system of the state as it will serve as an interchange platform for commuters to board either the Blue Line Rail or Bus Rapid Transit system to their destinations when they alight from the ferry or vice versa. This will further improve the pace of the state towards actualising ‘the greater Lagos’ vision. “I express satisfaction with the quality of the job done so far and promise that all the ministry’s projects would be monitored and executed to stand the test of time in tandem with world standards.” Abdullahi also assured residents that the jetty projects in other areas would be completed. “We have visited other ongoing jetty projects at Ebute Ero, Ijede and Okera-Nla among others, and we want to assure all residents that the present administration is committed to ensuring timely completion of the projects,” he added.
