Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade, has reiterated his commitment to ensuring that power reverts to the Southern Senatorial District of the state in 2023. The governor made his position known while speaking that the Governor’s Lodge in Calabar on Sunday. He said, “During my campaign for second term, I went to the South. I said ‘support my second term bid and when l win, I will support South to take over from me.’ “This is because, by natural process, you are the next senatorial district to produce the governor.” Ayade insisted that the South has credible people with capacity to be governor. “There is no senatorial district that does not have the right candidates to be governor of the state,” he said. Ayade decried the nature of democracy as currently being practised, saying that “Democracy is so primitively blind that it reduces itself to numbers. The higher your population, the more you win. So, there is nothing like balancing, there is no equity in democracy. There is no moral conscience. “Democracy is blind to ethnicity, it is blind to religion, it is blind to fairness, it is repugnant to natural justice.” He called foor a paradigm shift, even as he flayed the lack of opportunities and inclusion for the disadvantaged in the polity. Ayade, who dispelled speculations that he is backtracking on his commitment to return power to the South, added, “So, to be able to balance that, as governor, I still uphold my declaration that my successor will come from the South and indeed, he would come from the South. And for emphasis, yes, he would come from the South.” The governor said he could not and would not play God by being specific on who his successor will be.
