The Onimesi of Imesi-Ekiti in Gbonyin Local Government Area of Ekiti State, Oba Olatunji Olatunde, has commended the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on his fight against insecurity in the country. The traditional ruler lauded the efforts of Buhari at restoring good governance, particularly in the campaign against corruption and the gradual restoration of peace across the nation. Olatunde stated this on Saturday at Imesi-Ekiti during the installation of Lieutenant Victor Agunbiade of the United States Navy as Jagunmolu of Imesi Kingdom and Mrs Caprice Agunbiade as Yeye Jagunmolu of Imesi Kingdom. He said the Federal Government is trying its best at combating the menace with evidence of positive results. “Our common enemy as a country is insecurity, but the citizens can see that the Federal government is making efforts at combating the menace,” he said. The traditional ruler who described Agunbiade as the true son of Imesi-Ekiti, said he was honoured due to his immense contributions toward the development of the community. He added that Agunbiade served as Navy Disbursing Officer, Comptroller Department, Camp Lemonier, Djibouti, from October 2019 to July 2020. Responding, Caprice Agunbiade expressed excitement at the honour bestowed on her family, saying that they will remain in words and deeds, true sons and daughters of Imesi-Ekiti. Also, Ken Onwuliri and Nonso Chimezie were installed as Otunba Akorede and Chief Atayese of Imesi-Ekiti, respectively. Onwuliri, who could not hide his joy, pledged to provide the building blocks required for a new palace for Onimesi of Imesi. In his own response, Chimezie, who was a former Personal Assistant to a retired Inspector-General of Police, Mike Okiro, promised to support the ongoing construction of the Imesi police station. One of highlights of the event was the cultural performance by the Ekiti Cultural Troupe and the Igbo Traditional Council. (NAN)
