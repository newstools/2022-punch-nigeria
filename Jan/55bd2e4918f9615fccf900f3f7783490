Over 100,000 birds in poultry farms in Kaduna state are reported in danger following an outbreak of bird flu, avian influenza, confirmed in three local government areas of the state. The Kaduna State Government said the disease was threatening an estimated population of 107, 807 birds in farms in three local government areas of the state. The state Commissioner of Agriculture, Ibrahim Hussaini, who disclosed this during a stakeholders’ meeting with the Poultry Farmers Association, said the affected local government areas where the farms were located are Chikun, Igabi and Lere. The Commissioner, represented by the Director of Veterinary and Livestock Services in the ministry, Pakachi Zakariya, noted that the tests were conducted by the National Research Veterinary Institute. He added that three farms have been depopulated and decontaminated while the result for the fourth farm was being awaited. Hussaini appealed to farmers in the state not to panic over losses, saying there is a compensation policy for farmers in the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
