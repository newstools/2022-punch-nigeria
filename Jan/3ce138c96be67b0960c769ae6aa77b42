The Zamfara State Police Command has said it has rescued 68 kidnap victims, who had been held in a forest being controlled by a bandits’ kingpin, Bello Turji. Addressing journalists on Tuesday, the Commissioner of Police, Ayuba Elkana, said the victims were in captivity for over three months. The victims, according to the CP, were 33 male adults, seven male children, three female children, and 25 women, including pregnant and nursing mothers. He maintained that the victims were indigenes of Magarya, Maradun and Gusau in Zamfara State as well as Sabon Birni in Sokoto State. Elkana said, “Following an extensive pressure mounted as a result of the ongoing military operations around the camp of a notorious bandits’ kingpin, known as Bello Turji, that covers Shinkafi, Zurmi and Birnin Magaji local government areas, the command received information that some kidnap victims were seen stranded in the bush. “Police operatives, in collaboration with genuine repentant bandits and vigilantes, swung into action and rescued the 68 victims from the forest.” The CP stressed that the victims would be taken to hospital for medical check-up after which they would be returned to their respective villages.
