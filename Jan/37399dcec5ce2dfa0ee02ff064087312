The Supreme Head, Cherubim and Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria, Solomon Alao, on Monday said Nigerians should not expect credible elections in 2023 if the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill is not signed into law on time. He also said the country was in a difficult situation, regardless of the opinion of those in authority. Alao, who stated this at a press conference ahead of the church’s annual general conference, wondered why it took the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), 30 days to disclose his position on the bill when he knew the implication of the delay in signing the bill into law. Buhari returned the bill to the National Assembly last year over the restriction of political parties to direct primaries. But the C&S leader said, “I don’t think we are going to have credible elections in 2023 for two reasons: the law, enacted by the National Assembly, that will give us credible elections will not be in force before February. When the Electoral bill was passed, why was it on somebody’s desk for 30 days when he knew the implication of not signing it? “Expecting credible elections will be an illusion unless providence intervenes. Secondly, the budget that the umpire would need should be in its account at least 12 months before the commencement of the election. These are the difficulties ahead.” Copyright PUNCH.
