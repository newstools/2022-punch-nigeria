THE suspended Chairman of Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission, Muhyi Rimingado, has defected to the Peoples Democratic Party, ahead of the 2023 general elections. Rimingado told KANO FOCUS, an online Newspaper that he has submitted an online application to join the PDP, while he is expected to formally register at his ward in Rimingado Local Government Area in February. Since his suspension by the Kano State government on July 5, 2021, posters of the former chairman had flooded the streets of Kano indicating his interest to contest the governorship election next year. While some of the posters were without a political party logo, others bore the symbol of the All Progressives Congress. However, Rimingado had shunned the activities of APC either at the local government or state level and never identified with any of the warring factions of the ruling party. Recall that earlier in December 2021, the police foiled an attempt by Rimingado to address thousands of youths in Kano in commemoration of the International Anti-corruption day celebrations by locking the venue. However, speaking recently on why he joined the PDP, Rimingado said it is the only viable alternative that can salvage Kano state from its current political mess. Rimingado added that the PDP, as a repositioned party, “will cleanse the political mess in Kano come 2023.” “I have studied the current political situation in Kano and discovered that with the ongoing internal political crisis in both Ganduje and Shekarau’s camps of the All Progressives Congress, PDP is the only alternative party that can save the situation,” he stated.
