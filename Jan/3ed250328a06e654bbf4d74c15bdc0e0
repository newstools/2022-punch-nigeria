The students of the Federal University of Technology, Akure, Ondo State, on Monday protested the alleged harassment and extortion by some suspected thugs and cultists at the second entrance of the institution. During the protest, the students barricaded the road that led to the second gate of the university, causing traffic logjam in the area for several hours. They alleged that the thugs incessantly harassed those who live at off-campus at the South Gate Area, around the institution, especially the fresh students. They also alleged that the miscreants, on many occasions would harass and chase them into the school premises, without restraint from the security agents. One of the protesters, who identified himself as Bola said the alleged harassment had been on for a long time and it was currently becoming a daily occurrence. He said, “Some of these boys are thugs and cultists and they have been harassing for a long time, they forcefully collect money from students living at the South Gate area . So many times they would force students to make bank transfer.  We want government to look into this. While reacting to the development, the Head of Media and Protocols Unit of the university, Mr Adebanjo Adegbenro, said the students embarked on sensitisation march against actions of some persons living close to the South Gate who had been bullying some of the young students, saying there was no protest. He said, “We have done and still all we can, to ensure security of the students. We are also in constant engagement with the community to ensure those things do not fester. Our duty is to make report. It is the police that will make arrest and prosecute.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
