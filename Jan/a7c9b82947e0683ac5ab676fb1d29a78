Katsina State on Saturday evening announced the immediate reopening of all filling stations and cattle markets earlier closed down on account of cattle rustling and banditry in the state. A statement on the directive signed by the Secretary to the State Government, Muhammad Inuwa, was made public by his media spokesman, Abdullahi Yar’adua on Saturday. The statement said Governor Aminu Masari approved the directive. According to the statement, Masari instructed the two Emirate Councils in the State, i.e Katsina and Daura, to admonish District and Village Heads of the affected areas to be vigilant and ensure that “no any act of connivance by Sarakunan Fawa and others is allowed.” The statement warned that government would not hesitate to re-enact the closure where a resurgence of any dubious activity was noticed.
