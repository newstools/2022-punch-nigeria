Fast rising Nigerian singer, Habeeb Okikiola, popularly known as Portable, has apologised to Kenyans over the video he posted earlier. In a video on Sunday, Portable, who is currently in Kenya, was jeering at a lady who walked out on him after he informed her that he wasn’t available for ‘hook up’. ‘Hook up’ is a term used for the connection between commercial sex workers and their clients. Following the video, Kenyan radio presenter, Maureen Imbai, popularly known as Black Cinderella, called him out on Monday for ’embarrassing’ the country. Making a U-turn a few hours later, the Zazzu crooner apologised to Kenyans, as he shared another video of himself. Checks by our correspondent revealed that the singer had deleted the ‘hook up’ video he shared earlier. In his latest video, Portable, while speaking in Yoruba in an Instagram video, asked Kenyans to forgive him. He captioned the video, “We are not here for hookup. Stop asking men for money before sleeping with you. A man’s plan for you might be much more than what you charge. “I’m sorry for everything. I only find the video funny, that’s all. I love Kenya girls because even without hearing my language, they keep dancing to my songs and keep showing love.” Watch apology video below:  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
