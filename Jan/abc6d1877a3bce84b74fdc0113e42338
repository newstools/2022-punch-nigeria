Borno State Commissioner of Police, Abdu Umar, has confirmed the arrest of four miscreants who attacked and brutalised a female restaurant owner in Maiduguri, Fadila Abdulrahman. Abdulrahman was said to have been attacked at her restaurant situated at Shehu Sanda Kyarimi Park in Maiduguri by political thugs loyal to one of the lawmakers representing the state in the House of Representatives for attacking the personality of their benefactor on social media. The governor of the state, Prof. Babagana Zulum, on hearing of the attack, directed security agencies to fish out the culprits and make them to face the full wrath of the law. The governor’s attention was drawn to the incident after residents of the state took to their social media platforms alleging that the incident was sponsored by a member representing Jere Federal Constituency of Borno State, Ahmed Satomi, after the lady accused him (Satomi) publicly on her Facebook page. The lawmaker has since denied the allegation. The backlash followed a video which went viral on social media where a leader of the miscreants suspected to be political thugs was heard abusing the lady and threatening to kill her if she continues attacking Satomi. The police commissioner immediately swung into action arresting four suspects, Bello Musa aka Al-Shabba, 24 years; Nasiru Abubakar a.k.a. Mane, 22 years; Mala Mohammed a.k.a Bobby, 30 years and Ali Shettima a.k.a Ari, 25 years. In a press statement he personally signed on Monday, Satomi condemned the incident, and distanced himself from the act. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
