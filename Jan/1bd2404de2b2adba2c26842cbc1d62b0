Chief Magistrate Court three of Tumfure Area, Gombe State, Saluk Yusuf has sentenced 35-year-old Abdullahi Musa and 40-year-old Dahiru Ahmad to one year imprisonment without an option of fine. The two were charged for criminal conspiracy and intimidation contrary to sections 96 and 396 of the penal code law. According to the judgement, the two were said to have threatened one Usman Hassan after demanding N1m from the victim, who is also a resident of the state. Musa and Ahmad, however, pleaded guilty while pleading the magistrate for leniency. But Yusuf charged the men to Gombe custodial centre, adding that “there is right of appeal within 30 days.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
