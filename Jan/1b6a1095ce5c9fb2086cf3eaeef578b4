Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa, will get his chance to make another appearance at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon but he needs to be patient, according to interim coach Austin Eguavoen. Nigeria take on Tunisia for a place in the quarter-finals on Sunday (today) at the Stade Roumde Adjia in Garoua. Musa has made only one substitute appearance at the tournament, coming on for Kelechi Iheanacho in the 65th minute as the Eagles booked their place in the Round of 16 with a 3-1 win over Sudan. Despite being an unused substitute in the dead-rubber clash with Guinea Bissau, Eguavoen has been impressed with Musa’s attitude as a leader in the team. When asked if Musa would feature again at the tournament, Eguavoen replied, “He (Musa) will get another chance in the tournament. “We speak every time, his attitude has been very commendable and he does not show any sign of annoyance, which is a good leadership quality he possesses. “Hopefully, he will get some minutes pretty soon.” Musa is not the only captain in the history of Nigerian football to be a substitute at major tournaments. The late Stephen Keshi played only one game for the Eagles at the 1994 AFCON against Ivory Coast as the Eagles lifted the title for a second time in Tunisia, while Joseph Yobo made cameo appearances in the 2013 edition, totaling 102 minutes, as Nigeria lifted the title for the third time. Mikel Obi also started two games at the 2019 AFCON against Burundi and Madagascar but was subbed off in the 59th minute in both games.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
