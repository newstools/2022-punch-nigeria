An industry expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity on the impact of SIM registration ban on sales of SIM, told our correspondent recently, “Do you know how many people have been put out of work by that singular act? If there is a challenge, you don’t hurt businesses. You look for a way around it.” He had said that telecommunications companies’ customer acquisition was affected by the SIM registration ban imposed in December 2020, adding, “Any business that cannot acquire customers can’t make sales.
