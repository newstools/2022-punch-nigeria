Boko Haram terrorists have abducted an unspecified number of mobile policemen at the police mobile training school in limankara Gwoza local government area of Borno State, the hometown of Senator Ali Ndume, the Chairman Senate Committee on Army. Information available to The PUNCH revealed that the insurgent fighters attacked the training school around 8:22 on Thursday the 13 of January in the night with gun trucks and shot sporadically into the air before kidnapping the mobile Police instructors. The training school is located twenty-five kilometers from Gwoza town. It is a border town between Borno and Madagali LGA of Adamawa State. The attack is coming seven days after the terrorists attempted to infiltrate the Nigerian Army base in Gwoza in which they were successfully repelled by men of the Nigerian army. The Senate committee on Army led by Senator Ali Ndume paid a working visit to the theater command operation, Hadin Kai, in the area two days ago. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
