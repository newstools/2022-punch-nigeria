The Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN, has welcomed the return of soldiers of the Nigerian Army to correctional centres in the state. The Governor had earlier raise the alarm after the soldiers were withdrawn from the correctional centres days ago, saying it was an aberration and an undue security risk, adding that it could encourage jailbreaks. With the soldiers returned to the correctional centres, Akeredolu, in a statement signed his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, on Saturday, hailed the Nigerian Army for allowing good reasoning to prevail in the interest of the people. “We note the return of soldiers to the correctional centres as concerting. The security of lives and property of our people remain an onerous task that must be carried out without hesitation or sentiment. “A federal facility like the correctional centre should not have been left without deserving security for any reason. However, the return of the soldiers to the facilities is a positive development. “Both the Nigerian Army and the correctional centres belong to the Federal Government. There must be continuous synergy. We will also continue to do our best to give the necessary support when the need arises,” Akeredolu was quoted as saying. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
