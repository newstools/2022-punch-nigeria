Osun State Government on Friday assured residents that the forthcoming governorship election in the state would not hamper its food support scheme. This was disclosed by the state Commissioner for Special Duties, Lekan Badmus, at this month’s edition of food distribution where 30,000 vulnerable residents received food items from the government. Badmus said the initiative was enjoying the support of the Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, adding that the programme would not be affected by the increase in political activities ahead of the governorship election. He said, “The governorship election won’t stop this programme because it is something that we will go on with and so far, it has been a success. “Initially, people were scared about how we are going to finance it, but the governor has shown his financial prowess and ensured that the programme was successful and it is my belief it will go on without hitch.”
