The National leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, has dismissed the calls in some quarters that he should remain a kingmaker instead of being a presidential candidate in 2023. Tinubu stated this when he fielded questions from State House correspondents after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in the Presidential Villa Abuja on Monday. According to the APC chieftain, he is a Nigerian and he has the right to be the king himself, not just a kingmaker. He said, “I have never seen where it is written in the rule book anywhere in any country that a kingmaker cannot be a king unless he commits murder. I want to pursue my ambition without the title of a kingmaker.” The APC stalwart said he was in the presidential villa to formally inform the President of his desire to run for President in 2023. ”I can say categorically yes! I have informed the President of my intention but I have not informed Nigerians yet. ”I am still consulting and I have no problem consulting and I have not set a parameter of limitation to the extent of consultation. “You will soon hear what you want to hear all you want to hear, a categorical declaration; you’ve gotten that truth from me that I have informed the President of my ambition and you don’t expect more answers than that.” Copyright PUNCH.
