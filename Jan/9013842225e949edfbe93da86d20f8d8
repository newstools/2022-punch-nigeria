Cantu Beauty, an award-winning multicultural hair care brand, in partnership with Women Empowering Nations, has announced $250,000 (N36.75m) investment to champion women of colour globally through a series of career sessions, workshops, and leadership training. CANTU Beauty joins WEN, a non-profit organisation whose mission is to provide exposure, development and mentorship for girls of colour in underserved communities to accelerate their path to executive leadership in Nigeria, United States, United Kingdom, South Africa, France and Ghana. WEN and Cantu will be selecting 50 young women aged 17-23 from Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, United Kingdom, France and the United States to participate in the Girls Leading Our World Global Cohort, an immersive, high-impact leadership coaching experience beginning from March 2022 through May 2022. According to a statement by the organisation, the virtual programme will feature female executives from diverse backgrounds in entrepreneurship and leadership, who will lead workshops exploring career development, public speaking, professional branding and executive leadership. “The partnership programming will continue in June 2022, with the GLOW Virtual Summit featuring women and girls of colour who represent a spectrum of journeys in entrepreneurship and leadership. The event, with an anticipated global audience of over 1,000, will host young women leaders for engaging workshops to explore social change, economic justice, women’s empowerment and leadership,” the statement said. The organisers added that, “Two participants from each country will intern at Cantu Beauty for four months gaining hands-on experience in the beauty industry, equipped with a monetary stipend.”
