Oloni of Eti-Oni Asalu, a community in Osun State, Oba Rasak Aluko, has commended the state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, for completing Iperindo- Ipetu-Ijesa road. Aluko spoke during a rural community engagement organised by the Civic Engagement Office and held at Eti-Oni Asalu area of Oriade South Local Council Development Authority. The royal father said the road project, which was initiated by the immediate past administration in the state, after completion, has brought succor to the residents of the communities in the area, who are mostly farmers. He said, “The road has been a source of socio-economic catalyst and has brought succour to people of our area. The governor is a true face of continuity upholding the progressive developmental agenda in Osun. “We urge the governor to consider some other demands of our people such as grading of rural roads, electrification, water supply, among others.” In his remarks, Special Adviser to the Governor on Civic Engagement, Mr. Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, who represented Oyetola at the meeting, said government at all levels must be committed to the sanctity of good and productive governance to make an impact. The governor then restated the commitment of his administration to upholding the pace of good governance in both ideas and principles to set Osun on a high level of infrastructural and human capital development.
