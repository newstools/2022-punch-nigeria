The Ondo State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps has said the newly created all female armed special squad of the command will be provide adequate security to all the primary and secondary schools across the state. The Public Relations Officer of the command, Mr Daniel Aidamenbor,  in a chat with our correspondent on Thursday, disclosed that five trained female officers would be deployed to each of the 18 local government areas of the state, for the security of the schools and pupils. He said, “The female squad will start with training of students and teachers in all the 18 LGAs. We intend to deploy five per local government for this training. “After the training, they will be deployed to troubled spot schools within the state and also engage in patrolling the schools for emergencies. That is the strategy for now.” The commandant of the  NSCDC who had earlier officially presented the female special squad to Secretary to the State Government, Mrs Oladunni Odu, in Akure,  stated that the special female squad  was set up to provide security to the schools. He also sought for the training of the school children on security to reduce cases of kidnapping of pupils  in schools. The NSCDC boss said, “We should see it beyond policing them 24 hours because there is the need to teach children to be conscious of their environment. On our part, we are going to give the children tips so that they will know how to also handle their own security. “As we are teaching our students’ moral lessons in classes, we should also teach them about security and vigilance, because schools and children have become a critical national asset, while human resources are great assets.” Copyright PUNCH.
