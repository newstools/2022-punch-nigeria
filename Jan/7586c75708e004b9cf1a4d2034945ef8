The Lagos State chapter of the National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives has suspended its three-day warning strike. The nurses had on Monday commenced a three-day warning strike to protest poor remuneration and working conditions in the Lagos State health sector. But the state NANNM chairman, Olurotimi Awojide, after an emergency congress of the union on Monday said the strike would be suspended to allow government fulfil its promises. He said, “We appreciate the governor for his prompt response; we had a marathon meeting with him and other stakeholders. We are hopeful that implementation on our demands will commence immediately. “It is on this note that we are suspending the strike to give room for the implementation of our demands. All nurses in the state are expected back at their duty post by 8:00 on Tuesday.” Details later… Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
