The Police Special Fraud Unit, Ikoyi, Lagos State, has released the ID card and mobile phone of a PUNCHman, Toni Ufoh, who was manhandled while conducting an interview in front of the police unit’s gate last Wednesday. PUNCH Metro had reported that Ufoh went to the SFU to speak to some prospective tenants allegedly defrauded by a developer, Adewale Tunde. Ufoh was talking to the victims when he was accosted by policemen who accused him of filming the SFU building without authorisation. The cops subsequently seized his ID card and phone. The PUNCH Editor, Ademola Oni, in a petition, sought the intervention of the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, and called for the punishment of the power-drunk cops for attacking a reporter who was only doing his job. The Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, promised that the items would be returned on Tuesday when the public holidays would be over. The reporter met the SFU spokesman, Eyitayo Johnson, in the Dopemu area of Lagos, and the items were returned. Johnson called for a cordial relationship between the media and the police, saying both institutions played critical roles in national security. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
