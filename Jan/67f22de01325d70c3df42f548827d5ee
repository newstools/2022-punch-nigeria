Some victims of the collapsed church building currently receiving treatment at the hospitals on Thursday shared their experiences. A one-storey building housing a branch of the Salvation Ministries had on Tuesday collapsed at Okpanam community in the Oshimili North Local Government Area of Delta State. A father of two victims, Mr. Paul Wessey, told our correspondent at the hospital that his children were responding to treatment. Wessey said he was not part of the church service but immediately rushed to the hospital when he got the distressed call. He said, “Two of my sons and two of sister in-law’s sons were affected. I was not in church but I was in the office. “It was a terrible experience, it is not something to even talk about. I thank God that it is just an injury and with time, it is going to heal. “I have done the X-ray for this 4-year-old and we are taking him to the theatre for them to clean the injury.” Also, Mrs Rachael Odum, who also survived alongside her three children aged nine, seven and four, said, “we were at the point of receiving the Holy Communion when tragedy struck”. “I was there on Tuesday with my family members trapped inside,” she stated.
