The Super Eagles devoted enough time to practice set-peice and shooting from the edge of the penalty during Friday’s training sessions at the VSTS-ANNEX, Roumde Adjia Stadium, Garoua, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The three time African champions face Sudan in their second group game at the Roumde Adjia Stadium on Saturday (today). 26 players took part in the training session with only Chidozie Awaziem missing due to an ankle injury according to interim coach Austin Eguavoen. The four goalkeepers in camp Maduka Okoye, John Noble, Daniel Akpeyi and Francis Uzoho were involved in shooting practice which lasted for 10 minutes under the tutelage of Alloy Agu. Eagles first choice goalkeeper Okoye was heavy involved in the set-peice and corner kick session which lasted about 10 minutes. Eagles captain Ahmed Musa who was an unused substitute in the team’s 1-0 win over Egypt took part in penalty shootouts with Okoye saving one of his spot kicks. Eguavoen is expected to keep the same starting lineup for the game. A win for the Eagles against Sudan will secure their place in the next roUnd of the competition. The Eagles lead Group D with three points and are followed closely with Sudan and Guinea Bissau in second and third place respectively with a point apiece.
