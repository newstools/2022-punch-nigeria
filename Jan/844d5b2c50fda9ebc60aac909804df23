A former governor of Niger State, Muazu Babangida Aliyu, has said that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is the best candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the 2023 presidential election. The former governor and Chairman Board of Trustees of the Sir Ahmadu Bello Memorial Foundation made the remarks on Tuesday at the ongoing 2022 annual lecture of the foundation holding in Kano State. He said any “riff-raff or moneybags” would not get to the highest office in the land, “even if they bring out money in the 2023 election.” “Mr Vice President, do you know you are the best candidate in your party?” he said, describing Osinbajo as the only candidate that knows the country and has the acceptance of everyone across the country regardless of tribe and religion. “No matter how much money he has, let him bring the money and we will collect it,” he said without naming who he was referring to. The Emir of Lafia, retired Justice Sidi Bage also praised the Vice President, promising that Nasarawa State would give him all the necessary support to enable him to become the next President of the country. “Mr Vice President, wherever you go, we will follow,” he assured. He tasked the Federal Government and the nation’s elites to renew their social contracts with Nigerians to address the lingering security challenges bedevilling the country. He said human life in today’s northern Nigeria has been degraded by kidnappings, expressing worry that the situation required immediate attention. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
