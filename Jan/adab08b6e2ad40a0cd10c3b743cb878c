The executive committee of the All Progressives Congress of Lembi ward, in Akko Local Government Area of  Gombe State, has suspended a former member of the House of Representatives, Umaru Barambu. Making the pronouncements on Monday, the Chairman of the party in the ward Gwani Audu, at the state APC secretariat alleged that the former lawmaker had shown traces of anti-party tendencies, stressing that such would not be tolerated by the party leadership. Audu said the ward executive committee would not allow anyone to sabotage the party especially as the 2023 general election draw closer, hence their unanimous decision to suspend the party stalwart. The chairman also noted that the suspension would be in force until further notice, noting that the ward reserves unflinching support for the state Governor Muhammadu Yahaya. According to Audu, the governor is the leader of the party in the state, while urging all members from wards to state level to remain loyal to him in order not to give the opposition opportunity to infiltrate the party. He said, “We don’t want anti-party activities because we pledge unalloyed loyalty to the party. We also don’t like anything that will break the party. That is why we have suspended him until when he reaches out to us and makes amends. “APC is strong in Lembi ward. We don’t want division in the party. Therefore, we will not condone all these anti-party activities. We are totally in support of the governor.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
