Award-winning Nigerian singer, David Adeleke, popularly known as Davido, has again knocked his cousin, Dele Adeleke, for his Osun State governorship ambition. This time, the singer slammed the politician for writing about the death of his (Davido’s) mother in an article relating to his political ambition. In a series of tweets on Wednesday, Davido noted that his cousin employed people to write about him (Davido), though he cared less about that. However, the singer noted that his mother raised his cousin, yet the latter wrote about her death. “Because of your ambition, you have your people write about me (which I don’t care about) but to include the death of my mother in an article; the same woman that raised you. Ok Dele, God will reward you,” Davido tweeted. The Aye crooner noted that Dele Adeleke also stoop so low to mention the name of another family member, whom Davido simply described as ‘Aunty Vero.’ He said, “The truth hurt you that much you had to go that low to mention your Aunty Vero that cared for you. Well, I don open my crase for the year (sic). Stay tuned.” Davido had on Tuesday called out Dele Adeleke for eyeing the governorship seat of Osun State, a position which his uncle, Senator Ademola Adeleke, was also interested in.
