The Assistant Inspector General, AIG Zone 9, Umuahia, Isaac Akinmoyede, has warned his police officers to be more professional in their daily dealings with members of the public. Akinmoyede handed down this warning while decorating five newly promoted senior police officers serving at the Zone 9 headquarters and urged them to uphold the rights of the citizens by being cautious and fair in their policing assignments. The officers decorated are DCP Ajo Ordue, SP Ekwubiri Mercy, SP Emeka Chuks, ASP Turaki Shehu and ASP Tina Adindu. The AIG said their promotion came as a result of hard work and diligence in service, adding that the Police Service Commission gave them the promotion as a way of motivating them to greater service to the nation. Expressing his gratitude on behalf of others, DCP Ordue thanked the Inspector General of Police, Alkali Usman, for stabilising the process of promotion in the force which hitherto was not so. Ordue further thanked the AIG, Zone 9, and promised that they would not let the force down in their new ranks that would expose them to greater challenges. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
