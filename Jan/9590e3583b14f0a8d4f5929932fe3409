In this episode of So This Happened, we reviewed the story of a micro-loan company accused of designing and circulating the obituaries of the company’s defaulters to families and friends. We also reviewed the ongoing trial of the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu. Recall that Kanu on Tuesday appeared before Justice Binta Nyako to answer for 15 amended treasonable charges levelled against him by the federal government. Lastly, change has finally hit the transportation sector in Lagos state, as each bus driver is to pay N292,000 annually, asides from the other charges they have been paying. Copyright PUNCH.
