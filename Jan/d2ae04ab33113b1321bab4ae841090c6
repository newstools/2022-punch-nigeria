A former Senior Special Assistant to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), Kawu Sumaila, has said that those canvassing the candidature of a former President, Goodluck Jonathan, for the 2023 Presidential elections under the ruling All Progressives Congress are doing the party a great disservice. Kawu, a former three-term member of the House of Representatives, said in a statement on Wednesday, that Jonathan had played his role and should be left alone, noting that APC has candidates with better credentials from the southern part of the country. The former federal lawmaker, who also served as the Senior Special Assistant to the President on House of Reps Matters, said pushing for Jonathan to become APC’s flag-bearer would mean the party has failed. Describing the Jonathan backers as “enemies within,” Kawu said the APC has qualified and credible candidates from the southern part who can contest for the APC presidential ticket in 2023. “I don’t think those pushing for Jonathan to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari under our great party wish the APC well. Yes, Jonathan is a reformed democrat who deserves our commendation. “But he had played his own role under the PDP. Nobody will take away the credit of conceding defeat as a sitting President and handing over power to the opposition peacefully from Jonathan. As a matter of fact, he is better than some of the people at our party. “However, we cannot as a party say Jonathan should come and pick our Presidential ticket when we have better candidates in our midst. That will mean we have failed,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
