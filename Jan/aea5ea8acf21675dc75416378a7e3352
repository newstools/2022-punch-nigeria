The death toll from Lassa fever has increased to 99, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has said. This is as the centre revealed that no fewer than 4,482 cases had been reported so far. “Of all the confirmed cases, 84 per cent were recorded in Edo, Ondo and Taraba states,” the centre disclosed in its latest Lassa fever situation report published on Friday. Sunday PUNCH reports that Lassa fever, a disease endemic to Nigeria, occurs throughout the year but more cases are usually recorded during the dry season. The centre added that 4,482 suspected cases had been reported in all the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory. The NCDC noted that in 2019, a total of 796 cases were reported, while 1,165 cases were confirmed in 2020 at the height of the pandemic. The Director-General, Dr Ifedayo Adetifa, however, stated that the centre had sent alert letters to states to inform them of the looming outbreak. The centre, in a message on its website, appealed to health workers to “maintain a high index of suspicion for Lassa fever, be vigilant and look out for symptoms,” and added that “not all fevers are malaria.” Copyright PUNCH.
