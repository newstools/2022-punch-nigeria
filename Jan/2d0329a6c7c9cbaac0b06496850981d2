The All Progressives Congress Caretaker Committee led by Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, is considering February 25, 2022 for its national convention, Saturday PUNCH learnt on Friday. The consideration followed pressure being mounted on Buni by the governors elected on the platform of the party and its other stakeholders. However, the decision is not permanent as it will have to be approved by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) and other organs of the party, including the members of the Progressives Governors’ Forum. “We were told that the caretaker committee has settled for February 25 due to the pressure being mounted on them. However, the date is tentative and could change at any time,” said a source. Buni had come under fire earlier in the week from several governors, some of whom accused him and two others of hijacking the party. They further accused the Yobe governor of nursing a vice-presidential ambition and planning to install his stooges in the party through a nebulous consensus agreement.  Copyright PUNCH.
