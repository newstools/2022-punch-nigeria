Nigerian singer and songwriter, Divine Ikubor, popularly known as Rema, has gained admission into the University of Lagos to study Creative Arts. The singer announced this in a tweet on Friday, where he stated the reason he was going back to school. According to him, his mother wanted him to get a degree and that fuelled his decision to attend school. The announcement tweet read, “What if I told y’all I got an admission into Unilag? Lol, Mom said I still need to get a degree. oh well, see you guys in class!” Rema, who is signed to Don Jazzy’s Mavin Record label, noted that he’d try to drop his forthcoming album before he enters school. According to him, he doesn’t want his UNILAG fans to beat him up if he failed to do so. “I will try to drop the album before I enter school. So they’ll not beat me in UNILAG. Plus, I’m in the Creative Art Department,” he tweeted. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
