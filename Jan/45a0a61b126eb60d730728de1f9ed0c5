Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde. have said the late Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Oladunni Oyewumi, worked hard for the  development of his  town throughout the 48 years he spent on the throne. Oba Oyewumi died on December 12, 2021 at the age of 95 and was buried the same day according to Islamic injunction. A thanksgiving service was held in honour of the late monarch at the First Baptist Church, Oke’lerin, Ogbomoso on Sunday. Osinbajo said, “Without a doubt, the Oba’s passing has created a big vacuum among the league of traditional rulers in Nigeria. This is not just because of his age and almost half a century on the throne. It is because he was not just there, he made remarkable contributions to Ogbomoso and to Nigeria, for which the nation honoured him twice, first as Commander of the Order of the Niger and then as Commander of the Federal Republic (CFR). “His time certainly brought commendable development to this great and ancient town of Yorubaland.” Makinde, on his part, said the late monarch requested only one thing from him when he visited the palace ahead of the 2019 election. The governor said Oba Oyewumi told him that his only wish was to have the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology solely owned by Oyo State, saying he was happy that the monarch’s wish became a reality before he died. “Today, we have come to thank God that Baba came, saw and left his imprints on the sand of time. I appreciate all of you who have also come to celebrate Baba’s life too and pray that God will continue to be with us all,” he said. Osinbajo and Makinde also visited the residence of former Governor Adebayo Alao-Akala to commiserate with his family. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
