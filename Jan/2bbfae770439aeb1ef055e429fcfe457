The executive committee of the All Progressives Congress of Lembi ward, in the Akko Local Government Area of Gombe State has suspended a former member of the House of Representatives. Umaru Barambu represented Akko federal constituency when he won the 2015 National Assembly election but the Peoples Democratic Party candidate, Samaila Mu’azu Hassan, challenged his victory at the Tribunal. The lower tribunal dismissed the petition for lack of merit. The PDP candidate went to the Appeal Court which ordered a fresh election. He won the APC primary election on November 25, 2015 unopposed with 318 votes from the delegates. Making the pronouncements on Monday, the Chairman of the party in the ward Gwani Audu, at the state APC secretariat, alleged that that the former lawmaker had shown traces of anti-party tendencies, stressing that such would not be tolerated by the party leadership. Audu said the ward executive committee would not allow anyone to sabotage the party especially as the 2023 general elections draw closer hence their unanimous decision to suspend the party stalwart. He said, “We don’t want anti-party activities because we pledge unalloyed loyalty to the party. We also don’t like anything that will break the party. That is why we have suspended him until when he reaches out to us and make amends. “APC is strong in Lembi ward. We don’t want division in the party. Therefore, we will not condone all these anti-party activities. We are totally in support of the governor.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
