Nollywood actor, Uti Nwachukwu, on Wednesday noted that payment of tithes was effective though not compulsory. In a lengthy series of tweets, the actor stated that pastors should not coerce members to pay tithes. He wrote, “A lot of people get this whole tithing thing wrong! Does it work? Yes! But It is not compulsory! And you will not be punished for not practicing it! “It is an elective! A covenant blessing available for those interested. “What is wrong is using fear of punishment to threaten your congregation into practicing it! “It’s like the government waking up today to tell us that you’d be arrested if you don’t invest in real estate. “Same goes for first fruits, offerings and all types of giving. “Let people know the advantages but do not lie to them that they sin if
they don’t practice it. “Love and faith are all that matter in our chosen religion. “Your faith will always produce results. Which is why some people doing the unimaginable still produce results.” Sharing screenshots of his tweet on his Instagram page, the reality TV star noted that he wrote his message as he was led by the spirit.
