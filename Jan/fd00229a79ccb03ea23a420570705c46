Four inmates on Tuesday reportedly died in Kosere Correctional Centre, Ile Ife, Osun State, during an attempted jail break. A top security source told our correspondent that some inmates had planned to escape during the morning sanitation. The source further said that the inmates had, while attempting to flee the centre, injured a warder and were about to force their way out when security men repelled them. The source said, “Four inmates were killed. A warder was also injured. The incident happened during morning sanitation on Tuesday. “They had planned to escape and one of them attacked the warder, while others forced their way through the only entrance, but the security men repelled them and, in the process, four inmates were shot. “They eventually died. Others that wanted to escape ran back when those that led the attempt were shot.” The PUNCH also learnt that Osun State Comptroller of Corrections, Lanre Amoran, had visited the facility for on-the-spot assessment. But when contacted, the spokesperson of Osun Command of Correctional Service, Sola Adeotan, said there was no information on the incident. However, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Yemisi Opalola, confirmed the incident, but pleaded for more time to get details. “It happened but details are not available yet. I will get back as soon as I get further briefing,” Opalola said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
