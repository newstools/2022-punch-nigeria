Barely 48 hours after joining the English Premier League side, Watford, Samuel Kalu has been heavily taunted on social media over his real age, as several Hornets fans insist he is older than 24, his age, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The relegation-threatened club announced the signing of the Nigeria winger on a three-and-half- year deal from Ligue 1 outfit Girondins Bordeaux on Wednesday night. Kalu is the Hornets fourth signing of the January window following the arrival of full-back Hassane Kamara, central defender Samir and midfielder Edo Kayembe. After he was officially unveiled by the club, with his picture and that of their new manager Roy Hodgson, posted on the club’s Twitter handle, Watford fans took to social media to query the 24-year-old winger’s real age. A Twitter user MD said, “Is 24 the length of time he’s been at Bordeaux? Because he is NOT 24 years old.” Jordan Lee wrote, “More Kanu than Kalu. He is definitely not 24.” Diary_of_a_Disturbed_mind added, “Maybe his English age is 24, in Africa, he’s already a village elder.” Emmanuel Tembo asked, “How on earth is he 24years old?” “42 or 24 years? There might a mistake somewhere,” Abdul Shakur said sarcastically. Blaine Murphy tweeted, “There’s no way he’s 24! The next one to find out he’s got 4 different birth certificates.” Another Watford fan Jason Genova added, “You’ve been duped by a fake birth certificate.” “Lad…you sure he’s 24? Looks older than half the Upper Graham Taylor,” Salbs said. Gavin Smith said he would love to see Kalu’s birth certificate. He wrote, “I would definitely ask to see his birth certificate.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
