The Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, has said inclusive energy transition will boost social and economic prosperity in Africa. Onu said this while calling for inclusive energy transition in Africa during the virtual meeting organised by the International Renewable Energy Agency in his office on Friday in Abuja, according to a statement. According to him, Africa accounts for two to three per cent of world’s carbon dioxide emission that has varied enormous and energy resources, which include natural gas, hydropower, biomass, nuclear and coal. “Onu further added that the enormous advantage to be derived from the energy system can be effectively processed into final energies in the areas of abundance and be transported through inter-regional electric-grid connections, pipelines, roads/infrastructure to regions of resources deficiency,” the statement said. He said the negative effect of global warming could be seen in the drying up of Lake Chad, desertification, and coastal flooding affecting many parts of the nation. Onu said the Federal Government was committed to providing the enabling environment for private sector participation in the energy sector. According to him, the Petroleum Industry Act of 2021 seeks to promote investment in natural gas, Nigeria’s transition fuel for electricity, fuel, and non-energy usage. Copyright PUNCH.
