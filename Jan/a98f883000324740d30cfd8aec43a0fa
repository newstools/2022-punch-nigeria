Facilitation of passengers at the General Aviation Terminal of the Lagos airport will be affected as the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria is set to expand the Zulu wing of the terminal. FAAN General Manager, Corporate Affairs, Henrietta Yakubu, made this known in a statement titled, ‘FAAN to expand GAT, Lagos’. The airports’ authority said the expansion of the terminal at the local wing of the Lagos airport is part of efforts to improve infrastructure and service delivery in the aviation sector. The statement read in part, “The expansion project, which will commence any moment from now, will only hamper passenger facilitation minimally at the terminal, as normal passenger check-in will not be affected in any way. “However, the Protocol and VIP lounge at the terminal will be affected, as the facilities will be relocated temporarily till the end of the project, since major construction works will be carried out in that axis of the terminal. “Meanwhile, the Authority is already making arrangements for temporary spaces to be used as Protocol and VIP lounges, while the project is being executed. “When the expansion project is completed, the terminal would have been enhanced in terms of capacity, aesthetics and passenger comfort, as the expected and expanded new lounges will be twice what is presently on ground.” The Authority appealed to passengers and other airport users to be patient and bear any inconvenience while the project would last. The Lagos airport facilitates more than half of the about 12 million domestic passengers processed at local airports across the country, a situation that had made experts call on the airports’ authority to expand terminals at the airport.
