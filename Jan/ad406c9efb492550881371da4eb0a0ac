Saudia Arabia has said it will soon lift the restriction placed on flights from Nigeria to enable Nigerian pilgrims visit the kingdom for Hajj. This was disclosed by Saudi Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr Faisal Bin Ibraheem Al-Ghamidy, when he was paid a visit by the management of National Hajj Commission of Nigeria in his office in Abuja. The envoy was quoted by DailyTrust as saying, “I hope that the flight suspension on Nigeria into the kingdom would soon end.” The restrictions were placed in December 2021 to help curb the spread of the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron. The ambassador also spoke of compensation for victims of the September 2015 crane crash that killed many pilgrims in Mecca. He said authorities will ensure that relatives of the victims get the compensation. On his part, Chairman of NAHCON, Alhaji Zikrullah Kunle Hassan, thanked the ambassador while appreciating the mutual understanding between Nigeria and Saudi Arabia.
