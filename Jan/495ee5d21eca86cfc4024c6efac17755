The Osun State government has paid for the repair work on the faulty 7.5MVA 33/11KV substation supplying electricity to seven communities in the state. The affected communities of Moro, Akinlalu, Ipetumodu, Edunabon, Asipa, Yakooyo and Isogbe, have been in total blackout for over eight months since the substation developed a fault. The announcement of the release of funds, however, led to excitement among the residents of the communities. Addressing journalists during the facility assessment tour to the substation in Moro on Tuesday, the state Commissioner for Water Resources and Energy, Dr Amidu Tadese, disclosed that Governor Adegboyega Oyetola had approved money to repair the facility. Tadese, who said the repair work would last for six weeks, sympathised with the residents of the affected communities. He said, “Seven major communities of this council have been in total darkness in the last eight months. Sequel to this challenge, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola instructed the Ministry of Finance to release the required funds to repair the damaged facilities as part of efforts to restore the electricity with immediately effect. “This money has been released and paid into the account of Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company that is going to ensure the restoration and management of the facilities.
