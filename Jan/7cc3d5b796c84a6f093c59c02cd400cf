A Yaba Chief Magistrate’s Court in Lagos State has remanded Lagos Island ‘B’ Branch chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, Azeez Adekunle Lawal aka Kunle Poly in the custody of the Nigeria Police Zonal Monitoring Unit, Zone 2 Headquarters, Onikan, Lagos. Kunle Poly was remanded alongside two others – Prince Idowu Onikoyi Johnson and Agboola Akeem Kosoko – 30 days, over last Thursday’s deadly clash at Idumota, Lagos Island. Chief Magistrate Linda Balogun made the remand order after an application moved by the Police counsel, Mr Morufu Animashaun. Animashaun based his application on section 264(1), (2), (3), (4) and (6) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law of Lagos State (ACJL), 2021; sections 4 and 10 of the Police Act, 2020, and sections 6(c), 35(1)(C)(5) and (7)(a) of the 1999 Constitution. The police prosecutor argued that the remand order was needed to enable the police conclude the investigation of allegations of threat to life and property, violence, cultism, mayhem, conduct likely to cause breach of peace, unlawful possession of firearms, conspiracy, and murder against the defendants. The Chief Magistrate held that “I have listened to the submission of the counsel, as well as perused the application for remand and the attached affidavit. “I find merit in the application and it is accordingly granted. The three defendants are to be remanded in the facility of the Nigeria Police Zonal Monitoring Unit, Zone 2 Headquarters, Onikan-Lagos, for the next 30 days, to enable the police to conclude investigation”.
