EDO State Governor, Godwin Obaseki has directed the management of the State Health Insurance Scheme to commence the registration of all journalists in the state. The governor also stated that the policy covered primary and secondary health care. Obaseki said, “Registered journalists under the scheme would be eligible to access health care at both public and private hospitals in the state. “A card would be issued to an individual journalist at the point of registration. This card also covers for a specified number of members of the journalist’s family,” he added. The Special Adviser on Media Projects to the governor, Mr Crusoe Osagie, disclosed this during the inauguration of the newly- elected executive members of the Correspondents’ Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists in Edo State. Commenting on the health insurance, Crusoe said, “With the health insurance card, you (journalists) can work into hospitals and get treatment almost free. “The essence of building a hospital is to give people access to health care and that is what Governor Obaseki is doing.” Crusoe also dismissed insinuations that the 100-year-old Central Hospital buildings in Benin City had been earmarked for a motor park. He said, “The facility is no longer much of a hospital because most of the structures have decayed. “As a government, we don’t think it is wise to keep a derelict infrastructure for sentimental reasons so that people will not be angry.”  Copyright PUNCH.
