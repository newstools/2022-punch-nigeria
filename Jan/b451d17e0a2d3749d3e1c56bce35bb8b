The Governor of Delta State, Ifeanyi Okowa, on Monday congratulated his Sokoto counterpart, Aminu Tambuwal, as the latter clocked 56 years. Tambuwal, who is also the Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party Governors’ Forum, celebrated his 56th year on Monday and had received congratulatory messages. Okowa took to his Facebook page on Monday to share a picture of himself and Tambuwal as he showered the celebrant with prayers. The Delta State Governor wrote, “I join the family and friends of my dear brother, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, the Governor of Sokoto State and Chairman of the PDP Governor’s Forum to congratulate him as he celebrates his birthday today. “I pray that God continues to grant you strength, wisdom, and good health as you serve your people and our nation.” Earlier, Tambuwal’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Muhammed Bello, had celebrated his governor saying, “Happy Birthday, Gov Tambuwal at 56. The way you anonymously choose people and elevate them to high stations, may Allah in His infinite mercy continue to propel you to greater heights. May He continue to bless your loved ones, those you lead, and everything you do.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
