A Bauchi State High Court has sentenced three youths to 17 years’ imprisonment for armed robbery. The prosecuting counsel, M.M. Adamu, explained that the convicts, Muazu Ya’u, Adamu Abdullahi, and Awalu Babayo, were charged in September 2018 for armed robbery, an offence contrary to Section 96 and punishable under Section 97 of the Penal Code of Bauchi State, Vol. 1 of 2006. The second count charge stated that the men, together with one Ruwa Abdullahi, now at large, “attacked one Abdullahi Ahmodu with machetes and sticks, after which he became unconscious, as you robbed him of the sum of N60,000, thereby committing an offence punishable under Section 1 (a)  and (b) of the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions Act) Cap. R11, LFN 2004, as applicable to Bauchi State.” Delivering judgement in the matter, Justice Muazu Abubakar sentenced each of them to two years’ imprisonment on the first count, and 15 years each on the second count – without an option of fine. Reacting to the ruling, counsel for the defendants, Yakubu Maikasuwa, hinted that an appeal would be filed against the judgement. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
