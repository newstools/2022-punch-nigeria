Interim Super Eagles coach Austin Eguavoen may hand CSKA Moscow winger Chidera Ejuke the No.10 role in the team at the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations, which kicks off in Cameroon this weekend, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The tournament holds from January 9 to February 6 in Cameroon. Ejuke, one of the 13 debutants in the Eagles squad for the tournament, has been outstanding for his Russian club this season, scoring four goals and making two assists in 13 games for CSKA so far this season. The 24-year-old is also ranked the third-best dribbler in the world, according to CIES Observatory’s latest rankings – a form Eguavoen believes can help solve the team’s lack of creativity in midfield. Speaking at a press conference ahead of the team’s departure for the tournament, Eguavoen said, “The creative role is where the team has been lacking. “Of late, we have found Chidera (Ejuke) but if it is not working, we may have to change our tactics and be flexible in the way we play.” The three-time winners play seven-time champions Egypt in their opening game January 11, before they battle Sudan four days later. Their final group game is against debutants Guinea Bissau on January 19. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
