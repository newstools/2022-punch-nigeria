The Vice Chancellor of Elizade University, Ilara-Mokin, Ondo State, Prof. Olukayode Amund,  has warned new students of the institution against all forms of misconduct. The VC also warned the students against sexual immorality, declaring that the institution would not allow pregnant students on the campus. Amund gave the warning during the institution’s 10th matriculation on Friday. No fewer than 520 fresh students were admitted for the 2021/2022 academic session. According to the don, the university had zero tolerance for indiscipline and social vices and any student caught in such acts would be sanctioned appropriately. He said, “You should shun all forms of examination malpractices and other acts of misconduct. The university maintains a zero tolerance for cultism, brigandage, physical violence, drug abuse, stealing and indecent dressing. “The university hostels have no care facilities for expectant mothers and would not harbour pregnant students on campus. To be forewarned is to be forearmed. “The students’ handbook is currently under review to spell out the rules of engagement on campus, the violation of which shall attract appropriate sanctions.” Amund noted that the university runs 30 fully accredited undergraduate programmes in the four faculties of law, engineering, basic and applied sciences and humanities as well as social and management sciences.
