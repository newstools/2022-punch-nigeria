Popular singer, Omawumi Megbele, has dared online trolls to confront her face-to-face, following a direct message she received on Instagram. The singer took to her Instagram page on Friday to share the screenshot of the DM, as she made an open call to ‘faceless’ online trolls. “If you like, keep locking your comment section, you will mourn over your own child! Your child’s life will be cut short,” read the message she received. The Delta-born afropop singer has been alleged to be connected to one of the accused students in the death of a 12-year-old student from Dowen College, Sylvester Oromoni. When the news of the death went viral last month, the singer had locked her comment session on her Instagram posts. Addressing the DM and confirming her connection to the Dowen scandal, Omawumi wrote, “See the first thing I open my DMs to see? What did I do? What did my child do? Because I didn’t post on my page? “Did you come to my house to see me grieving? Or did you think I was dancing? Both children, one of the formerly accused and the deceased are connected to me! I don’t need to come and explain anything on social media! “The purpose of this rant is for people like that twerp, that ant, and that dead among the living faceless carcass that said sent that to me. May the rot start from the hand you used in typing that into your soul! “This is 2022! Anybody wey send me rubbish ehn, use the same energy talk am face to face. Anything wey you see, take am like that!” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
