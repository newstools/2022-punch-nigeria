Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, on Thursday, said the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), shamed naysayers who thought he won’t visit the South-West state for the inauguration of some projects. The governor said, “I thank President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR for honouring our invitation and identifying with us. Some naysayers had said Mr President you are not going to come but I knew that you are going to come and I want to thank you personally for coming.” Buhari, who arrived at the Mojoda inauguration venue in Ijebu-Ode area at 11:37am was received by Abiodun, governors of Yobe (Mai Mala Buni), Ekiti (Kayode Fayemi), Ondo (Rotimi Akeredolu) and Osun states (Gboyega Oyetola), and other top government officials.
