Over 200 persons are said to have been killed in the Anka and Bukkuyum local government areas of Zamfara State by fleeing bandits. It was gathered that the bandits, who were fleeing as a result of ongoing military operations, were trying to leave the state with large number of animals when they attacked some villages in the two local government areas, killing over 200 people in the process. The attacked villages are Rafin Danya, Barayar Zaki, Rafin Gero and Kurfa. An indigene of the area, who gave his name as Mohammed Kurfa, said he was in his village when the bandits arrived. Kurfa said they came with over 3,000 cattle and were trying to leave the state when members of a vigilante group tried to engage them in a gun battle. He stated, “When they were seen approaching the village, the vigilante group members came out to defend the people of the village, but they were overpowered by the bandits, who were moving in large numbers. “They killed many of the vigilante group members and also set the village on fire and killed many people, mostly women and children. “The other  neighbouring villages of Rafin Danya, Barayar Zaki and Rafin Gero were also attacked at the same time and it was discovered that more than 200 persons lost their lives.” An eyewitness, who spoke to the BBC Hausa Service, said three villages, Rafin Danya, Kurfa and Rafin Gero, were completely burnt down by the bandits. It was also gathered that the villages suffered heavy casualties. Efforts to confirm the incident from the state Commissioner for Security, Mamman Tsafe, did not yield results as he did not take his calls. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
