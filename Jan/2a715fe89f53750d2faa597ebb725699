Abia State Government has dragged a member of the state House of Assembly and member of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, Obinna Ichita, before a State High Court sitting at Umunneochi and presided over by Justice Benson Anya, asking that he be restrained from further publishing defamatory statements against Izuchukwu Onwughara and the government. Onwughara is a civil servant in the state Ministry of Environment, Umuahia and also the Project Coordinator, Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project in the state. Ichita had, through his Facebook account, disclosed that the state had received $56 million from the World Bank for flood mitigation and road construction works all in Aba. The claim did not go down well with the state government. In his statement of claim, the claimant said all the claims made by Ichita “are all false statements and are defamatory of his person in his office and exposes him and the Abia State Government to ridicule, hate and harassment from members of the public.” He is claiming as damages against Ichita for libel and a written apology, among other demands.
