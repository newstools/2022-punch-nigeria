NO fewer than 100 Christian clerics, mostly Bishops, have announced their intention to hold a three-day prayer and fasting programme for Governor Yahaya Bello’s emergence as the president in 2023. According to a statement signed by the convener, Bishop Jonathan Praise, the clerics were drawn from each state of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory. He noted that over 1,000 church leaders were also expected alongside their pastors at the Unity Fountain Abuja, the venue of the prayers. Jonathan said the purpose of their gathering was to provide “a spiritual shield and support” for Governor Bello, who according to him is “God’s anointed choice to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari”. Like the Biblical David, he explained that Bello is “a man after God’s heart and must be protected by all means to fulfil his purpose.” Recalling how Bello rose to become governor, the cleric said it was not a mere coincidence but destiny, adding that he would again shock critics at the next polls. He stated, “In the Scriptures, there is no king who was the apple of God’s eye like David. The heart of God had a special affection for the man who was later described by the Lord as, a man after my heart, who will do all my will. (Acts 13:33). “David was not perfect. He failed and sinned in many ways. So why did God love and bless him so much? Because God chose him. Yahaya Bello is our David. He embodies all his traits.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
