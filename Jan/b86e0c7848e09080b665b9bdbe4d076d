Fierce looking armed robbers have allegedly attacked a bullion van belonging to a yet to be disclosed bank. The PUNCH gathered that the bullion van was successfully robbed while the robbers carted away an undisclosed amount along Otor-Owhe on the Ughelli-Asaba dual carriageway in Isoko North Local Government Area of Delta State. The robbers were said to have shot sporadically at the bullion van as the bullets bore holes on the windscreen of the vehicle conveying cash. A community source told our correspondent that the hoodlums operated unchallenged by security agencies thus emptying the bullion van. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe, confirmed the incident. He said, “Yes, the bullion van was attacked but no casualty was recorded. Initially, I was told that the hoodlums carted away an undisclosed amount of money but now I’m hearing that the bullion van was empty. “I’m waiting for the official report of the DPO to ascertain the true incident but nobody died in the operation and efforts are ongoing to arrest the perpetrators.” Copyright PUNCH.
