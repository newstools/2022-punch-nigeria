Remo Stars will be hoping to continue their impressive start to the season when they tackle Dakkada FC in a matchday four fixture at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium, Uyo on Sunday (today). This will be the first topflight meeting between these two sides in the topflight and there will be a lot to figure out from both managers. However, they’ve both met in the Nigeria National League and the last time was in in 2016 where former players, Victor Mbaoma and Oche Salifu gave the Sky Blue Stars a 2-0 victory at the Otunba Dipo Dina Stadium in Ijebu Ode and the return fixture saw Dakkada defeat Remo Stars by 1-0 in Uyo. Remo Stars are the in-form side as they currently top the league table after three games which include two wins and one draw. Dakkada however are 14th on the log from three games – one win and two losses. Dakkada’s only win this season has come from a home game and they will be looking to continue their impressive form while the chance of ending Remo’s unbeaten run will serve as an icing on the cake for them. The hosts, recently decided not to write to the League Management Company over the goal scored by Heartland in their midweek loss to the Naze Millionaires on Wednesday.
