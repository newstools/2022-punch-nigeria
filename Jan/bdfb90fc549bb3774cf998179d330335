‘Highfro’ singer, Segun Adekunle, aka Labule, has said that he named his new song, ‘Zero’ to change the negative impression people have of the number. Speaking on the inspiration behind the song, which was released on Friday, January 28, he said, “I decided to address this controversial digit by changing the narrative with the aim of inspiring my fans not to give up in the face of adversity this new year. “I believe not all bad situations are really hopeless as the element of surprise is always lurking around to turn one’s hopelessness to optimism and victory. “We have unconsciously accepted and believe that zero is synonymous with failure and emptiness. It is something we see in everyday life but what people consider to be empty and worthless can work wonders with the element of surprise in it. “For example, if I want to buy airtime online and I mistakenly add another zero to the figure, I would scream because that zero would have altered the original amount I wanted to buy. The same goes for accounting officers and auditors— adding a zero can alter everything either positively or negatively. Basically, zero is not as useless as we all think it is. A worthless situation can be turned around, so don’t give up. The mere fact that you are not where you think you should be does not mean things cannot change. It is just me trying to lift the spirits of people and inspire them to dream and be ambitious.” Other songs by Labule, who is a graduate of Engineering from the University of Lagos, include ‘Smartie’ and ‘Gbegbese’.
