Barcelona have been dealt a double injury blow after the club confirmed on Thursday that Frenkie de Jong has sustained a calf strain while Ronald Araujo will need surgery on a fractured hand. De Jong and Araujo were both substituted during Barca’s Copa del Rey win over Linares Deportivo on Wednesday. Araujo will undergo surgery on Friday and is likely to be out for a few weeks. De Jong should be back sooner but the Dutchman is not expected to be available for Saturday’s game against Granada in La Liga. A club statement read, “Ronald Araujo has a fracture in his right hand. The player will undergo surgery on Friday under the supervision of the club’s medical services.” The statement added: “Frenkie de Jong has a calf strain in his left leg. He is out and his availability will depend on his recovery.” AFP
