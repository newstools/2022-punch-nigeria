A 32-year-old Hallilu Aliyu has been arrested by the Gombe State Police Command for masterminding his own kidnap over N500,000 ransom. Aliyu and 42-year-old Ahmed Ladan were said to have been arrested based on complaint received by policemen attached to the State Intelligence Bureau, Gombe. A statement obtained by our correspondent through the command’s Public Relations Officer, Mary Malum, said the case bordered on criminal conspiracy, intimidation, kidnapping and extortion. Malum said, “The first suspect, Haliru Aliyu ‘m’ of Tudun Wada quarters Gombe was given a tricycle to ride by his sister in-law after his business has collapsed. “However, the said suspect later sold the tricycle for N250,000 without the knowledge of the owner. “When the owner asked for the tricycle or her money, the suspect failed to bring any. Because of the shame, according to him, on December 30, 2021, the suspect went to his friend’s house, the second suspect, one Ahmed Ladan ‘m’, where they criminally conspired and faked a kidnap of the said Haliru Aliyu with the intension to extort his elder sister one Zainab Aliyu ‘f’ aged 42yrs of the same address, the sum of N500,000 to enable him to refund the money.”  Copyright PUNCH.
