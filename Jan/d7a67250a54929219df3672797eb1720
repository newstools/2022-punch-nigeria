One of the Presidential aspirants under the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, has stated one of the things he would do if elected President come 2023. Tinubu has said that his administration would pay the West African Senior School Certificate Examinations for Nigerian students, no matter their background. He said this while addressing some women chieftains of the APC, in a video published by GistReel. He said, “Your children’s West African examination fees will be paid by us, so that no one, no matter how poor, will be left behind.” The former Governor of Lagos State also stated his intention to stabilise the country adding that he was in the race to break the shackles of poverty in the country. Tinubu also advised the women to remain in the APC and support it stating that it is a progressing party. “The symbol of our party is a broom. The symbol of my cap is breaking shackles. You break the shackles of ignorance, poverty, and many things. “We need stability in the country. We need peace and the stoppage of banditry is extremely important because women are the vulnerable victims of banditry, violence, and instability. Without peace and stability, we cannot build a nation as rapidly as we want,” Tinubu stated. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
