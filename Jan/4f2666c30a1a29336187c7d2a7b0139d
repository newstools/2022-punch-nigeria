Former President Goodluck Jonathan has said he regretted that the late Head of Nigeria’s Interim National Government, Ernest Shonekan, left government too early. This is as he described Shonekan as a man who lived a worthy life and contributed to the nation’s development. Jonathan stated this on Monday during a condolence visit to Shonekan’s family in Ikoyi, Lagos. He said, “My regret is that he left government too early. I am sure if he had stayed as head of the interim government for two or three years, he would have instituted the political process and the controversies we are having with the 1999 constitution today would not have happened. “He left too early because of the military intervention and the rest which I do not want to say much about. The government was hurriedly given to civilians and today, we are still discussing our constitution.” Jonathan added that he learnt much from the late Shonekan as members of the Council of State. “Ernest Shonekan was somebody that I worked with closely as members of the Council of State. I learnt so much from him. When I was in office I was presiding over the Council of State, in terms of age, I was the youngest amongst all the Heads of State, but when I left office, I was still a member and I learnt a lot from him. “He was a man of wisdom and had a good background in the corporate world and in economic issues and as a private man he founded the Nigerian Economic Summit Group that is still there today,” he said.
