A 24-year-old man has been remanded at Abolongo Correctional Centre, Oyo town, for defiling a 17-year-old girl. The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps in Oyo State arraigned the suspect, Abidemi Oriyomi, before Magistrate P.O. Adetuyibi of the Family Court 2, Iyaganku, Ibadan. The state Public Relations Officer of the NSCDC, Oluwole Olusegun, in a statement on Friday, said the suspect was charged with rape after the completion of investigation by the Anti-Human Trafficking and Children Protection Unit of the command. He said the court was told that Oriyomi defiled the 17-year-old inside a bush along the Ibadan-Oyo Expressway on December 4, 2021. The case with charge number MI/FC/6C revealed that the suspect allegedly committed an offence contrary to Section 34(1) and punishable under Section 34(2) of the Oyo State Child Right Law, 2006. He said the magistrate adjourned the case to March 3 and ordered Oriyomi’s remand till then. The Commandant of NSCDC, Michael Adaralewa, warned those engaged in such criminal acts to desist or be ready to face the full wrath of the law. He said, “Let us say no to rape, stop kidnapping, shun cultism and jungle justice.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
