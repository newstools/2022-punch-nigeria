The Duke of Cambridge, Prince William, has presented the medal for the Officer of the Order of the British Empire to a British gospel singer, Muyiwa Olarewaju of Nigerian descent. Olarewaju took to his Instagram page on Friday to share pictures of the investiture ceremony held at Windsor Castle. Sharing the pictures, Olarewaju wrote, “For Services to music. Thank you to everyone that has relentlessly invested in this ‘young man’. You made it possible. A lecturer of mine told me no one is paying attention to you doing gospel music. Years later, here we are.” See photos below:   Olarewaju was awarded an OBE when he appeared on Queen Elizabeth’s 2020 birthday honours list but received the medal during an investiture ceremony on Wednesday, January 12, 2022.
