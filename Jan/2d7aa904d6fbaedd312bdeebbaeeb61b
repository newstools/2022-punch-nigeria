The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, on Thursday, in Kano claimed that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress administration has recorded more achievements than the United States government in terms of infrastructure. Fashola, who made the declaration in Kano during the “APC conversation series”, explained that it is the ruling party’s initiative of creating awareness on its achievements in the last seven years. The Minister said, “I can assure you that the current President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC administration has achieved what even the US government is aspiring to accomplish in terms of infrastructure. “As of December 2021, we have completed 941 kilometres of roads across all states and geopolitical zones. In Kano State here, for instance, there are 21 road projects either in, around or in the neighbouring communities.” “Prior to APC’s administration, when last do you remember Federal Government completing 50 kilometres road in any part of the country? “So, this is the positive change we promised Nigerians in 2015 and it is already happening. They say we are the same with them, but we are not. They stole money and took it abroad, but we are taking this money back and investing it in the area of infrastructure,” Fashola added. Fashola pointed out that there are 850 ongoing projects under his Ministry, including roads and bridges construction, as well as houses in 34 states of the country. Copyright PUNCH.
