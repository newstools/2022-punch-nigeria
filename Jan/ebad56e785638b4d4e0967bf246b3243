The Chief Judge of Lagos State, Justice Kazeem Alogba, has said the judiciary is committed to ensuring the protection of the human rights of citizens. Alogba, according to a statement on Wednesday, said this during a courtesy visit of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights in his office in Ikeja. He said, “As part of ensuring that the human rights of citizens are protected, magistrates in the state have been visiting police stations to release those who have been unlawfully detained and minor offenders who have not been charged to court while also making recommendations in accordance with the rules of law. “The Lagos State Judiciary was recently adjudged the best in the jurisdiction of enforcement of fundamental human rights and we implore CDHR to continue being a human rights watchdog, as they have the judiciary’s support in accordance with the law.” The chairman, CDHR, Lagos State branch, Mr Kehinde Adeoye, explained that the organisation is a non-governmental, independent body that focuses on ensuring the full implementation of human rights. “December 10 is a day set aside for World Human Rights, and the CDHR is ready to collaborate with the judiciary and other institutions with similar objectives,” he said.
