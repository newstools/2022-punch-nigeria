Barring any change in plan, the 30 abducted students of Federal Government College, Yauri, Kebbi State, who regained their freedom over the weekend will reunite with their families on Monday (today). A source, who disclosed this to our correspondent hinted, that the freed students and a teacher are undergoing medical examination prior to their release to their families. “Same treatment was given to their mates freed on October 21, 2021 and they were subsequently released to their parents the following day,” the source said. He, however, declined further comment when asked if ransom was paid in exchange for the students. The PUNCH reported that 102 persons, including 94 students, four teachers and another four non-academic staff members, were abducted by bandits from the school last year. At the last count, 73 students and three teachers have regained their freedom. Three students had, however, been confirmed dead. While confirming the release on behalf of the state government, the state governor’s Special Adviser on Security, Col. Rabiu Kamba (retd.), also refused to reveal how the state government secured the release of the students and a teacher abducted over six months ago when gunmen stormed the school. Kamba said, “The release of the students and a teacher tells you that government really made a lot of efforts and efforts are still under way to secure the release of the remaining ones still in captivity. “Government is on top of the situation and it would not rest on its oars until the remaining students regain their freedom.” On his part, the spokesperson for the Kebbi State Police Command, Nafiu Abubakar, said he has not been officially informed about the development.
