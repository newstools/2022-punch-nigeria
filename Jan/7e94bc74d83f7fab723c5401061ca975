Singer, Adekunle Kosoko, aka Adekunle Gold, seems to have started 2022 on a bright note as he hosted his fans, music industry stakeholders and the media to a listening session for his forthcoming album on Wednesday, January 19, in Lagos. The album will be his fourth and it has already been heralded by singles such as ‘Catch Me if You Can’, ‘High’ (featuring Davido), and ‘Sinner’ (featuring Lucky Daye). Guests were ‘treated’ to songs off the album in a serene environment, with a lot to eat and drink. Gold also responded to appraisals, questions and recommendations from guests in attendance. In an interaction with journalists and other attendees, the singer said, “Artistes should do whatever they want to do. Whatever you are ‘feeling’, do it. Do not let anybody ‘gate keep’ or ‘police’ your work. It’s your work first before you put it out. When you put it out there, it can then belong to people (fans). I think artistes need to be very intentional with whatever they are creating.” Asked if he was involved in the production for the album, he said, “I was very much involved in the production. I told them (producers and sound engineers) what I wanted to hear.” Talking about the inspiration behind the body of work, Gold stated that as an artiste, he is constantly evolving and aims to improve his writing with every new record he creates. Producers that worked on the album include Blaise Beatz and Quebeat; while some of the artistes featured were Ty Dolla$ and Stefflon Don.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
