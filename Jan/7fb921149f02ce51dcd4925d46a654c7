EDO State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress on Tuesday accused Governor Godwin Obaseki of destroying public buildings that are adding value to the lives of the people of the state and replacing them with parks and department stores. Addressing a press conference at the party’s secretariat in Benin City, state chairman of the party, Col David Imuse (retd.), also denied rumours that the state Youth Leader of the party, Tony Kabaka, would soon defect to the ruling Peoples Democratic Party. He also accused the governor of frustrating attempts to use the court to inaugurate 14 lawmakers who were elected but till date are not sitting. Imuse said, “On the demolished Central Hospital, Obaseki’s government’s plan is a motor park as replacement but a few weeks ago, the government through its spokesman, Mr Adaze Enwanta, explained that it did not plan to demolish but was merely relocating Central Hospital to Stella Obasanjo Hospital premises along Country Home Road, Benin City.” Copyright PUNCH.
