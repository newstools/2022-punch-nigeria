According to a statement, the founder of Scope Digi Communication, Ayobami Adefajo, said the app is available to logistics companies to help them secure more customers, both individuals and organizations, who are major players in the industry. He said, “Just like Uber, Bolt etc., Gbera is majorly on logistics companies and solely on delivery but not limited to motorbikes; van, buses among others will also be deployed. “GBERA is an easy-to-use dispatch hub app available on both android and iOS. Gbera app caters for the everyday delivery needs with just a push of a button. “We have a user-friendly mobile app that connects dispatchers in major cities with users to deliver economical delivery services in just a few clicks for a variety of user groups, from companies to individuals.” According to Adefajo, many online retailers and customers who rely heavily on logistic startups to get their goods have been faced with the challenge of the unreliability of many logistics service providers, thereby hampering the growth of their business.
