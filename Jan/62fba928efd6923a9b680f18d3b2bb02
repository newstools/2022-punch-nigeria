Former Big Brother Naija season five housemate, Ka3na Jones, has knocked fans who always ask for giveaways without bothering about knowing certain information about her. She said this on her Instagram story on Friday where she revealed that she stumbled on the page of an American rapper, Wiz Khalifa, and had begun research to know more about him. Sharing a picture of the rapper, the mother-of-one said, “Stumbled on his page for the very first time and instantly fell in love with his personality. So lively and fun. All I need right now. “I’m very picky when it comes to following other celebrities! But Wiz Khalifa was love at first sight. I’m going to live in his comments with a daily dose of love. The dude is mad fun.” She also shared a screenshot of the rapper’s Wikipedia page, saying, “When I like someone, I take the liberty to know the tiniest things about them. I bet some of y’all claiming fans here don’t know the name of my community in Rivers state. All I hear is, ‘Boss lady, I’m your fan. Do giveaway’. But then again. I don’t mind.” Three weeks ago, the reality TV star has celebrated six years marriage anniversary with her foreign husband. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
