The Lagos State Internal Revenue Service has given firms based in the state till January 31, 2022, to file their annual tax returns or risk penalties for late payment. A statement on Tuesday signed by the Head, Corporate Communications, LIRS, Monsurat Amasa, quoted the Executive Chairman of the agency, Mr Ayodele Subair, as advising businesses and employers of labour on the need to avoid sanctions due late payment. The statement read in part, “The agency also reminds businesses and employers of labour of their statutory obligation to file annual income tax returns pursuant to section 81 (2) of the Personal Income Tax Act Cap P8 LFN 2004 (as amended). “The Act stipulates January 31st as the deadline for filing of annual income tax returns, failing which penalty accrues. The only available platform for filing of annual income tax returns in Lagos State is the LIRS e-Tax portal: https://etax.lirs.net. “The e-tax portal is built for the convenience of taxpayers. It is easy, convenient and safe. All businesses and employers of labour are advised to use the e-tax portal to file their returns. Taxpayer ID of all employees is compulsory for the annual income tax returns to be successfully filed on the e-tax portal.  All rights reserved.
