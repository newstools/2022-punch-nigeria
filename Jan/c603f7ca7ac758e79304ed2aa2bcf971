THE Catholic Bishop of Ondo Diocese,  Jude Arogundade,  has said the challenges currently facing Nigeria would do the country no good if nothing was done to salvage the situation. According to the cleric, there must be a resolve among the leaders towards assuring the citizenry that the country could be great again. The Catholic Bishop stated this on Saturday at the funeral of Madam Morenike Komolafe, mother of the Deputy Managing Director of Thisday Newspaper, Mr Kayode Komolafe, held at St. Joseph’s Catholic Church, Igbara-Oke, Ondo State, on Saturday. In his homily, Arogundade said “Our country is at a crossroads and no individual can save it all alone. We must all accept that the challenges and controversies in our country today do us no good. “They (leaders) must be resolved to give new hope to citizens and the assurance that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. We must come together to unite around our common purpose and shared vision. This is the way we will honour the legacy of the generation that left us so much to hope for.” He described Madam Komolafe, who died at the age of 87, as a woman who contributed her quota to the development of the church and the country, adding that she  embodied all that makes one noble and honourable. “Today, we have come to testify that Mama Morenike Victoria Komolafe fulfilled her Christian obligation in her earthly journey and we have come to entrust her to the love and mercy of God.” Copyright PUNCH.
