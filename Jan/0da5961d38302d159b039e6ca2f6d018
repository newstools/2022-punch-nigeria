A tanker laden with premium motor spirit exploded on Friday morning  at the Upper Iweka junction of Onitsha, Anambra State. Many shops and buildings around the scene are feared burnt as a result of the fire from the explosion of the tanker that had broken down along the busy Onitsha-Owerri Road in front of the Relief Market. The fire which started at 8.30am had caused a long standstill of vehicles in and out of Onitsha. Fire services both from Anambra and Delta states have arrived the scene and are battling to quench the fire amid a shortage of water. Details later…  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
