An Ekiti State Chief Magistrates’ Court, Ado Ekiti District, has ordered the remand of a 35-year-old man, Ayodeji Abiola, for allegedly killing his 75-year-old mother, Florence Abiola. The defendant is facing a count of murder. The police prosecutor, Olasunkanmi Bankole, in an ex parte motion, begged the court to remand the defendant in a custodial centre. This, he said, would allow police to complete their investigation, while the duplicate case file would be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The charge sheet read, “Abiola Ayodeji was reasonably suspected to have committed the offence of murder on his 75-year-old mother, Abiola Olaitan Florence, on January 11, 2022, at Ipole Iloro in the Aramoko Ekiti Magisterial District. The offence is contrary to and punishable under Section 319 (1) of the Criminal Code, Cap. C16, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012.” The defendant, who hails from Ipole Iloro in the Ekiti West Local Government Area of Ekiti State, said in his statement to the police that he had a misunderstanding with his mother on the day of the incident and while he was chasing her with a stick, he hit her on the head, leading to her death, while he later dumped her corpse in the bush. Chief Magistrate Titilayo Olaolorun, who granted the prosecutor’s request, said, “The defendant is ordered to be remanded in the Nigerian Correctional Centre, Ado Ekiti, for 30 days pending the completion of police investigation.” Olaolorun adjourned the matter till February 21, 2022 for mention.
