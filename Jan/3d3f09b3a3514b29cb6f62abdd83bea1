The Lagos State Government has said it has resumed its enforcement of town planning laws on property across the state. The General Manager, Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority, Mr Kehinde Osinaike, said this in a statement on Monday, adding that the enforcement   in the Ikeja axis had been concluded. He said, “The authority has resumed its enforcement and monitoring exercise following the short break during the 2021 end of the year holiday and restated its determination to rid the state of illegal developments. We have now extended the exercise to the Oshodi area of the state following the conclusion of the same in Opebi/Allen axis of Ikeja. “During the concluded exercise at Ikeja, property that violated the town planning laws were sealed while buildings that were initially sealed but unlawfully unsealed without official authorisation were partially resealed, including shops on road setback.” Osinaike added that the agency would also carry out similar enforcement on property in Ajah. “The Monitoring and Compliance Unit of the agency has carried out a monitoring exercise in Eti-Osa, especially to check property that were sealed last year to ascertain if they have not been illegally unsealed by the owners. “They also will continue this in Ajah axis to ensure that property along Lekki-Epe Expressway that have not regularised their developments — from residential to commercial property — will be partially sealed to ensure compliance,” he said.
