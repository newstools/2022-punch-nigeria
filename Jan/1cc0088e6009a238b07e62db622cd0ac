Nigerian musician, Harrison Okiri, professionally known as Harrysong, has denied fathering twins, as he noted that his latest daughter, Daviva, was his first child. The Raggae Blues crooner took to his Instagram story to warn people to refrain from calling him father.of twins. He wrote, “Addressing this issue. I am not baba twins or daddy Ejima. There was never any twins anywhere. That lady never gave birth. She lied and was eating my money. My first child is Daviva.” (sic) The singer had announced the birth of a set of twins named Perez(boy) and Tare(girl), back in 2017 with his then-girlfriend, based in Abuja. He, however, welcomed a baby girl, last month with his wife. With his latest revelation, the singer has affirmed that his three-week-old daughter was his first child. Copyright PUNCH.
