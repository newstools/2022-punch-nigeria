Super Eagles are leading 3-0 in their ongoing Africa Cup of Nations encounter against Sudan in Cameroon. Samuel Chukwueze’s goal put Nigeria ahead three minutes into the game through an assist from Moses Simon. At the 45th minute, Taiwo Awoniyi’s header gave the Super Eagles their second goal. A skilful Moses Simon tripled Nigeria’s lead 35 seconds into the second half. Before the commencement of the second half, Alex Iwobi replaced Samuel Chukwueze, who scored Nigeria’s first goal. Nigeria and Sudan are meeting for the third time at the Africa Cup of Nations, but it’s their first encounter at the tournament for 46 years. Sudan won the first match 4-0 in the 1963 group phase whilst Nigeria won the second 1-0 in 1976. Nigeria have won 10 of their last 12 Africa Cup of Nations games (L2), keeping six clean sheets. Following a draw in their opening match against Guinea-Bissau (0-0), Sudan have managed just one win in their last 14 Africa Cup of Nations games (D6 L7), dating back to the 1972 edition. Nigeria won their opening game (1-0 against Egypt) to an Africa Cup of Nations for the second tournament running, having failed to win their first match in four of their previous five appearances (W1 D1 L3). The Super Eagles are looking to win their opening two matches to an Africa Cup of Nations in consecutive tournaments for the very first time. Sudan players had threatened to shock Nigeria by ensuring that they grabbed the three points in the ongoing game.
