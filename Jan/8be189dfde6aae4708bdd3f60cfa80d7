A non-governmental organisation, the Ikeja Viva L’amour Lions Club, recently organised a vintage party to celebrate and socialise with elderly people. The event which took place at Omole area of Lagos State during the week was organised in order to help cater for the needs of senior citizens who often suffer loneliness. The president of the organisation, Mrs Agnes Duke, said that it was a need they saw and they had put up their resources to plan the event so as to spend time with the elderly people. She said, “Christmas is a time to share and receive love and that is why we have decided to extend our love to the senior citizens. “We want our elderly people to stay safe and have a good life. They have laboured in their younger years and we are here to tell them that the world has not forgotten them. We still care for them, despite COVID-19 and other challenges.”
