THE Nigerian Army has said the troops of Operation Hadin Kai killed no fewer than three terrorists during a raid in Damask, Borno State. It also said the troops destroyed an illegal market operated by the terrorists. A statement on Saturday by the Director of Army Public Relations, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu,  said the troops encountered the terrorists at the illegal market which led to a gun duel. It read, “Troops of 5 Brigade, Sector 3 Joint Task Force, North-East Operation Hadin Kai  while consolidating on their dogged push to deplete Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province terrorists  in Borno State, recorded a decisive victory against the terrorists in Damask on Friday, January 7, 2022. “The gallant troops, while conducting clearance operations, code-named Operation DOMINANCE I, came in contact with the terrorists at an illegal market operated by the terrorists in Gallo Malawari village. In the fierce encounter, three BH/ISWAP terrorists were neutralized, while the others, bowing to superior firepower retreated in disarray.” He noted that the troops recovered one AK47 rifle, a truck, two motorcycles, four empty magazines and rounds of 7.62mm ammunition, amongst others, from the terrorists.
