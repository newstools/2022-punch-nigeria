Adaeze Yobo, the wife of former Super Eagles player, Joseph Yobo, has sent her love and encouragement to the Nigerian team after their elimination from the African Cup of Nations. The Eagles were eliminated from the 2021 AFCON after they lost 1-0 to Tunisia in their Sunday encounter in the Round of 16. The Eagles had won all their three matches at the group stage in Cameroon but lost to Tunisia to the shock of many Nigerians and international observers. Sharing a video of herself in a Nigerian jersey, Adaeze Yobo wrote, “Nigeria For life, baby. My son woke up and asked if it was a dream. “Mummy, was it a dream?” I said no. It’s real and that’s real life baby. “Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, that doesn’t make you a loser. We are all human, and when we lose we must not forget how great our wins were. “In all, we move. @ng_supereagles we are proud of you; each and every one of you who stepped out to represent us. Keep your head up high, kings.” Watch video below:  Similarly, Amara Kanu, wife of former Super Eagles player, Kanu Nwankwo, shared a video of herself in Nigeria jersey with the caption, “Yesternight left most Nigerians around the globe speechless on getting eliminated early from the African Nations Cup by losing 1-0 to Tunisia.
