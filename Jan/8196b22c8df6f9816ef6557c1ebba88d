Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, has said he will declare whether or not to run for the presidency in 2023 after the All Progressives Congress national convention scheduled for February. The governor disclosed this on Wednesday while addressing journalists in Lokoja, the state capital. According to him, the APC as the platform through which he became the governor, must conduct its national convention before he can declare intention to contest any position under the party. Bello stated, “We are looking forward to the convention of our great party and by the grace of God, I will declare. But we must have a platform to run on and that is the All Progressives Congress. “The party has been built solidly under the leadership of Governor Mai Mala Buni. They have done a great job; we shall conclude the rest at our convention. “By the mandate and calling of Nigerians – youths, women and people all over the world – who are calling me to run and build on the achievements of President Muhammadu Buhari, I will surely answer them immediately after our convention as the case may be.” He commended the Extraordinary Caretaker Convention Planning Committee led by the Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, for its efforts towards the convention and said the APC would be stronger after the national convention.
