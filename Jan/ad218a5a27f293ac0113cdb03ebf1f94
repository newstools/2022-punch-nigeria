The various state governments in the Niger Delta and the multinational oil companies operating in the region have been called upon to, as a matter of deliberate policy, embark on aggressive youth employment this year as part of measures to tackle insecurity in the region. Also, they were enjoined to set in motion workable media plans for sustainable awareness on the desirability of effectively changing the negative narratives in the Niger Delta region with a view to fast-tracking inflow of gainful investments and economic activities to the region. The calls were contained in a communiqué issued by a group of media executives from the Niger Delta region at the end of a one-day workshop facilitated by Gbaramatu Voice, a multimedia organisation in the region. In the communique signed jointly by Asiayei Enaibo and Rume Ogane, the participants highlighted the “massive potentialities of the Niger Delta region as an investment as well as cultural and tourism hub”. The communique urged stakeholders to, “as a matter of urgency, deploy the necessary information technology for awareness creation on the limitless investment opportunities in the Niger Delta region”. “The information technology should be widely deployed to globalize the challenges in the Niger Delta region with a view to profounding viable enduring solutions,” the communique stated in part. The keynote speaker at the workshop, Tosan Harriman who is the Chairman, Editorial Board of Gbaramatu Voice, had earlier described journalists as influential people in the society urging them to deploy their influential arsenals to promote social and economic development of the Niger Delta region.
