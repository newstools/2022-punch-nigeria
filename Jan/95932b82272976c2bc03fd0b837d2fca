The Chief Judge of Delta State, Justice Tessy Diai, has ordered the release of four inmates, Sampson Oghenegweke, Odi Oghenervwe, Obakporo Oghorodi and Abdulahi Karimu, from the Sapele Medium Security Custodial Centre. The cases of the four inmates were among the 661 cases of awaiting trials reviewed by Justice Diai on Saturday. The inmates were held in custody for offences including alleged murder, conspiracy and membership of secret cults among others. Justice Diai said the total number of inmates released from the Warri and Sapele Custodial Centres visited so far stood at nine while 661 cases of awaiting trials were reviewed. Oghenegweke’s counsel, Mr. Kingsley Otoghile, from the Legal Aid Council in Warri, argued that keeping his client in custody for three-and- half years without trial negated the spirit and letters of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law of Delta State, 2017 which provides for speedy dispensation of justice. He said, “Having recourse to the antecedent of my client who was charged for an alleged unlawful carnal knowledge, and with information by Director of Public Prosecution to the effect that no witness had come to testify since his detention, the defendant deserved to be discharged in the interest of justice. “The Chief Judge, having carefully examined the facts of Oghenegweke’s case and taking into cognisance of DPP’s legal opinion, discharged the inmate.” Copyright PUNCH.
