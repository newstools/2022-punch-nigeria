Super Eagles media officer, Babafemi Raji, has confirmed that defender, Chidozie Awaziem, is not COVID-19 positive. The defender was not listed for the Eagles opening 1-0 win against Egypt on Tuesday and was also missing from the team’s recovery training on Wednesday, with several media reports (not PUNCH Sports Extra) stating that the player had contracted COVID-19. However, speaking on the medical condition of the player, Raji rebuffed claims that the player had either contracted the virus or suffered a knock as speculated by others. “Awaziem is a bit under the weather, nothing really serious but just a little illness otherwise he would have been here (in training). “It is also nothing pertaining to the knock he had or people said he had. He is good to go.” When asked if his illness was COVID-19, Raji replied, “No.” Awaziem has been a utility player for the Eagles since making his debut for the team in 2017. The Alanyaspor man has been deployed in central defence and right-back positions. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
