The Ogun State Internal Revenue Service has said it will block revenue leakages through collective efforts of Ministries, Departments and Agencies to achieve more than the N155bn revenue target for this year. The Executive Chairman, OGIRS, Mr Olugbenga Olaleye, said this in Abeokuta on Thursday at a budget strategy session, according to a statement by the Press Officer, OGIRS, Abolanle Ogunlami. He said, “The percentage increase over last year’s budget figure necessitated the collective efforts geared towards blocking and bringing all revenue leakages into the government coffers. “When all units and MDAs work together, share ideas and information, areas of leakages and more revenue opportunities will be identified.” Also speaking at the event, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Revenue, Mr Abiodun Adeleye, said the aim of the event was for revenue officers to rub minds, reflect on last year’s performance and strategise on how best to expand the tax net, boost revenue generation and surpass the targeted revenue figure for 2022.
