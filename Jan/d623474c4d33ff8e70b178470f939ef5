A former Secretary, Delta North Senatorial District of the All Progressives Congress, Delta State chapter, Mr. Victor Sorokwu, has said he was not part of those who defected to the People’s Democratic Party contrary to the announcement by the PDP. The state Chairman of the PDP, Kingsley Esiso, had announced Sorokwu among the APC members who defected at the PDP mega rally held last Saturday in Asaba. Briefing journalists on Monday in Asaba, Sorokwu said he never at any point contemplated joining the PDP and was shocked when he started to receive calls from friends, party members and others asking him if he has truly defected to the PDP. He described the announcement as cheer desperation of a party afraid of its shadow in 2023. He said, “I have been in the PDP from 1999 to 2015. I know the PDP inside out. I worked for the emergence of Governor Okowa as a staunch member of Face to Face. All leaders called me to know, but l told them there is no way l can defect. “A good name is better and integrity should be my watchword. Some names that were mentioned there never defected, they were not there. “Delta should not be a one-party state; we should allow opposition to help in development. Come 2023, the PDP will become opposition.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
