Air Peace has announced the introduction of an initiative, called ‘Priority Boarding Policy,’ to honour Nigeria’s military personnel, both serving and retired. According to its Chief Executive Officer, Allen Onyema, the airline holds the contributions of the military in securing Nigeria and defending its territory from external aggression in high esteem. “This Priority Boarding Policy we are introducing is our own way of appreciating and recognising the noble and patriotic efforts of the officers and men of Nigeria’s Armed Forces, for the risks they take and all the sacrifices they make in defending the territorial integrity of this country. Our ground staff have also been enjoined to appreciate them,” he said in a statement on Friday. Onyema urged other passengers to show understanding and cooperate with the airline’s ground personnel to ensure a seamless implementation of the new policy. He said other businesses should adopt a similar policy in honour of the Nigerian military.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
