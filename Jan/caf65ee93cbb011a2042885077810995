The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has joined the entertainment industry in celebrating renowned songwriter, singer and journalist, Onyeka Onwenu, on her 70th birthday. This is as he congratulated the multiple award-winning artiste and actress for leading a life that keeps inspiring both the old and young. Buhari’s felicitation is contained in a statement signed on Sunday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, titled ‘President Buhari greets Onyeka Onwenu at 70.’ Adesina, in the statement, said, “The President affirms that Onwenu’s creativity, sincerity of purpose and diligence continue to bring glory to the country, starting out as an NTA presenter and reporter that caught the world’s attention by putting a spotlight on corruption in the 80’s, and releasing songs with great social and moral impact. “President Buhari felicitates with the former Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer of National Centre for Women Development and Chairperson of Imo State Council for Arts and Culture for the fresh ideas and institutional reforms she brought into public service, passionately creating and pursuing a vision for a better life for many.” As the journalist and activist turns 70, Buhari believes her many recognitions and awards, at home and abroad, were well deserved, particularly in directing her energy into global movies with historic contexts, and sharing the gospel of Christ. The President, therefore, prayed that the Almighty God will continue to bless the “One Love’’ crooner with long life and good health. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
