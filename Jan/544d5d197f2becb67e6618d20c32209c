The Ogun State Police Command has arrested three men for allegedly vandalising and stealing from the mast of a telecommunications company in Ota, in the Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government Area of the state. The suspects, Kabiru Olusola, 27; Taye Daniel, 43; and Afeez Balogun, 47, were arrested following a distress call received by policemen attached to the Atan Ota police divisional headquarters. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, in a statement on Sunday, said the chief security officer of the company in charge of the mast, Shuaib Muhammed, alerted the police that some hoodlums numbering about six invaded the said mast, situated at Ketu along the Agbara Expressway. Oyeyemi added that following the distress call, the Divisional Police Officer, Atan Ota, dispatched a patrol team to the scene, where the three suspects were apprehended, while others escaped. He said, “Upon the distress call, the DPO, Atan-Ota division, quickly dispatched his patrol team to the scene, where the three suspects were apprehended while others escaped. “Recovered from the suspects were seven backup batteries valued at N3m, a rectifier module, as well as their operational vehicle, with number plate, AAA 779 XL.” Oyeyemi said the state Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, had ordered a comprehensive investigation into the case with a view to charging the suspects to court as soon as possible. He added that the CP also directed that the escaped members of the gang be hunted and brought to justice. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
