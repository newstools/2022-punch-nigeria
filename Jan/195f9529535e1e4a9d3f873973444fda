Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, on Monday, declared his intention to begin consultations on whether to contest the 2023 presidential election. The governor stated this while responding to calls by stakeholders and members of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state who endorsed him to be the candidate of the party. Tambuwal said he would begin consultations across the country before making his intention known by the end of February. Earlier, the PDP in the state had endorsed the governor as the next President of the country. Rising from a stakeholders’ meeting, a former deputy governor of the state, Mukhtar Shagari, called on Tambuwal to declare his interest in the presidency. Shagari, who is also a former Minister of Water Resources, and a major stakeholder in the affairs of the party in the state, said it was time for the governor to come out and rescue Nigeria from misgovernance. He assured the governor that his supporters in the state are ready to extend consultations to every part of the country. Also, Danbaba Danbuwa, representing Sokoto South Senatorial District, who spoke on behalf of members of the National Assembly, said there was no better time for Tambuwal’s presidency than now. He said most of his colleagues in the National Assembly, especially those elected on the platform of All Progressives Congress, have been calling on him to prevail on Tambuwal to declare. He revealed that most of the senators, irrespective of their political differences, promised to support the governor in becoming the next President. In his remarks, a former Minister of Power, Bello Suleiman, described the governor as the most qualified candidate. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
