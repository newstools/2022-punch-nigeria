Bose Ogulu, the mother of Nigerian Grammy award-winner, Burna Boy, has revealed that she and her son usually disagree over how money should be spent. The singer’s mother, who also doubled as his manager, revealed this in an interview that was recently aired on CNN. When asked what she and her son disagree with the most, she answered that it was expenditure. Bose noted that she and her son, born Damini Ogulu, do not have the same thoughts when it came to money. “We don’t think we should be spending money on the same thing,” she said. According to her, Burna Boy comes up with ideas without thinking of how much it would cost; even when they plan video shoots. Bose said, “So he comes up with really crazy ideas without really thinking about what it costs or what it doesn’t cost. And so, my first reaction would be no, that’s not going to work. How are we going to make back that money?” The manager-mum then revealed that she has, however, learned that her answers shouldn’t always be no. Rather, they’d find a way to make things look like what Burna boy wanted without having to spend much money. “And then I learned that it’s not ‘no’. It’s just that we should find a way of still making it look like what he wants or close to what he wants without spending as much,” she said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
