Great Nigeria Insurance Plc has said it is committed to sustainable initiatives geared at ensuring greater performance and profitability in 2022. The company said this during its annual thanksgiving and praise offering at its head office in Lagos, according to a statement titled ‘2022 our year of phenomenal growth and profitability’. The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mrs Cecilia Osipitan, in her New Year address, appreciated all members of staff for their staunchness and performance in the past year. She urged her colleagues in management to bring to fore an unrelenting commitment and dedication in ensuring the achievement of the targets set for 2022. She appealed to the staff not to relent in their quest of making the GNI brand the most preferred and patronised brand in the insurance industry in Nigeria. Osipitan urged everyone to prioritise accomplishment as the watchword for the organisation’s operations in 2022. She also announced the result of the half-year appraisal exercise, which, according to her, was in tune with the organisation’s resolve to always recognise and reward outstanding performance. The details of the exercise showed that 16 employees were elevated in different cadres of the organisation to higher positions of responsibility while 13 members of staff received their employment confirmation owing to a satisfactory performance during their probationary period. “Our greatest asset is the human capital, which we have recognised as the key success factor in organisational growth and survival; hence, we will keep motivating our employees through a continuous reward process so that they can perform at their optimal level at all times,” Osipitan said.
