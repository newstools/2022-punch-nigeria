No fewer than 11,000 members of the governing All Progressives Congress, in Funakaye Local Government, have defected to the opposition, the Peoples Democratic Party. Speaking on Saturday, during the reception, a chieftain of the PDP, Abubakar Abubakar, assured them that the issues they faced in APC would not be witnessed in their new home. Abubakar, who was a former member of House of Representatives from 2007 to 2011, noted that the defectors moved in view of their neglect by the APC after working towards its victory in the 2019 election. According to him, “I was once an APC card carrying member but i deserted it due to lack of organisation and non-performance of the state governor, Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya.” Abubakar further alleged that the governor had not carried politicians along who were instrumental to his victory. Reacting on the impact of the defection, Moses Kyari, Gombe Publicity Relations Officer of APC, said the defectors dumped the party for personal reasons. “They think they could not secure tickets in 2023, hence they opted for the PDP,” he said.
