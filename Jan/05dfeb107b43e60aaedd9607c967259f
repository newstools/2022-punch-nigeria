The Ondo State Chief Magistrate Court, sitting in Okitipupa, has ordered the remand of a 16-year-old boy (name withheld) for his involvement in the act of armed robbery and rape. The defendant was arrested on November 24, 2021, for allegedly committing the offences at Sekere village in the Okitipupa Local Government Area of the state. He was said to have robbed one Serifat Tijani of N15,000, while armed with a dangerous weapon and also attempted to rape the victim. According to the prosecutor, Olusegun Akeredolu, the defendant broke into the house of another victim, Mewo Kolawole, and stole clothes belonging to his children. The teenager was arranged for conspiracy, armed robbery and rape. The prosecution said the offences contravene Sections 410, 390 (9), 6 (b), 1 (2) (a) and (b) 359, 411 and 2 (2) (a) of the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Act, Cap RIl, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004. The teenager, who was not represented by any lawyer, told the court that he did not commit the offence alone, that he has a boss whom he delivered the proceeds to anytime he went out for robbery. The accused person disclosed that he had lost his mother and two younger brothers, and since then his father has been the one taking care of him. His plea was however not taken by the court. In her ruling, the Chief Magistrate, Folasade Aduroja, ordered the remand of the accused in the state juvenile home and adjourned the matter till February 8, 2022, for his arraignment in family court.
