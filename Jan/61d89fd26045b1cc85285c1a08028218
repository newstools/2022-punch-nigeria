A seven-year-old boy died instantly while his sister and mother, identified as Mrs Jennifer Timothy sustained varying degrees of bodily injuries when the commercial motorcycle conveying the trio to a crossover night church service crashed in Warri, Delta State. Sunday PUNCH gathered that the crash occurred at Ovwian, Udu Local Government Area, when the motorcycle had a head-on collision with a vehicle. It was gathered that the boy lost his life on the spot as he hit his head on the road while his mother sustained fractures in both legs.
