The Gombe State Governor, Muhammadu Yahaya, has sponsored the transport fares of 700 exchange students from the state to various states of the federation. Addressing the students on behalf of the state government at Government Science Secondary School, Gombe, Permanent Secretary Ministry of Education, Ahmed Muhammad, represented by the coordinator exchange programme in the ministry, Abdu Garba, advised the students to be good ambassadors of the state at their various schools of studies. According to him, the current administration has placed priority on education, adding that it was doing everything possible to ensure that education regains its rightful position in the state. Muhammad called on parents to support the government by liaising with the ministry of education on any information regarding their children at their various schools. He said, “Government is not happy with the way some parents use to send transportation money to their children. So the government of Alhaji Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya has made provision for their transportation to and from the schools. “This includes students from other states that are on exchange programme in Gombe, to their various states of origin. While enumerating the importance of the free transportation exercise, Muhammad said this would serve as encouragement and uptake of education. “Governor Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya deserves commendation for the provision of Gombe line buses to convey the students to their various schools. Transport fees for one person from Gombe to Kwara is about N10,000 and Gombe state is transporting over sixty students to Kwara state alone,” Muhammad said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
