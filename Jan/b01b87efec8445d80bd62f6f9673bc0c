The Nigerian Meteorological Agency, through its Central Forecast Office, has alerted the public of reduced visibility in some states in the northern part of country. The Agency, in a statement signed by Muntari Yusuf Ibrahim, said it observed on Monday that dust was raised over Faya Largeau, a dust source region in Chad Republic, during the morning hours of January 17. It said dust plume is expected to be transported towards Nigeria, adding that this will reduce visibility ranges in the Northern parts of the country during the morning hours of January 18. NiMET said, “…most parts of the Northern cities would be engulfed by the dust from mid day of 18th January, 2022. “Areas expected to be mostly affected include Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, Bauchi, Gombe, Katsina, Kano, Jigawa and Zamfara where horizontal visibilities should be around 1000m and below. “NiMet further cautioned that flight operations may be disrupted therefore airline operators are required to pick up their flight folders and adhere to regulations, especially at aerodromes in the Northern parts of the country while road users are advised to drive slowly and carefully due to poor visibility during this period.” People with respiratory problems should take caution, the statement advised.
