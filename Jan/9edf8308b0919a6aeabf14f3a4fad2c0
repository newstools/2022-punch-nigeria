The  Lagos State Government has announced a new format for vehicles in the state to be inspected and issued roadworthiness certificates. The Director, Vehicle Inspection Service, Akin-George Fashola, said this in a statement on Tuesday, adding that the new exercise is not targeted at generating money for the government. He said, “We are appealing to car owners in the state to come forward with their vehicles as the cost is already inclusive in the total package they paid for the renewal of vehicle particulars. “The old format of issuing a roadworthiness certificate and then expecting the vehicle owners to bring their automobiles forward for inspection within 30 days is no longer sustainable as most people do not bring their vehicles for the said inspection once the certificate is issued. “The referral note that we give when you come to us is just for a grace period that covers 30 days in which we expect you to have checked and fixed the vehicle. The referral note is not an automatic clearance.” Fashola added that vehicle owners could have their automobiles inspected in any area of the state. “You can go to any centre within the length and breadth of the state; even if you do your first inspection on the mainland and you had to do your second inspection on the island, you have no problem because they are all connected,” he said.
