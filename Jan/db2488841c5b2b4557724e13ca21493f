Sadiq Umar has pleaded for patience and support after he scored his first goal for the Super Eagles at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Sadiq opened his goals account for the Eagles in their final group fixture against Guinea-Bissau on Wednesday and was hurled off afterwards. The lanky striker has been criticised for his overall output at the tournament, but he believes he will improve. “It has not been easy but the fans should keep supporting us and be patient because I believe we will keep getting the results,” the Almeria striker said. On his goal, the 25-year-old said, “It was a special moment for me and my family to score my first goal. “I was calm (when the goal did not come) because I know another one will come. I just have to be me and believe in myself. “The coach has been trying to help everyone especially me and (Kelechi) Nwakali because this is our first Eagles call-up. “We are trying to put ourselves into the group. “And I want to learn more.” Umar will be aiming to make his fourth appearance for the team on Sunday when they play their Round of 16 game versus Tunisia.
