The Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, has advised the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to take strict action against drug peddlers and asked him to revisit the War Against Indiscipline introduced by his military regime. The monarch said in a statement on Wednesday that a return to the WAI policy had become imperative to check the activities of criminals and expressed concern over the security challenges facing the country. Oba Akanbi also urged Buhari to introduce capital punishment for culpable terrorists, bandits and drug dealers to address incessant killings of innocent Nigerians. The statement read in part, “Insecurity in Nigeria is becoming too alarming. I read of gory attacks by terrorists in Zamfara State. It was pathetic and horribly terrible. The failure to decree capital punishment such as killing of perpetrators is (one of the factors fuelling the) unabated attacks. “One other factor is the lack of effective control and light punishment for drug dealers. Most perpetrators are barefaced and merciless due to hard drugs’ intake. Once most of them take hard drugs, they lose control of their mental operation and kill mercilessly. The government should move forward to control and effect capital punishment for hard drug dealers. It is one of the remote solutions. “In 1984 under the military administration of Tunde Idiagbon and General Muhammadu Buhari, the law and enforcement of capital punishment against hard drug dealers were effective. WAI was working and was very efficient. President Muhammadu Buhari should revisit those days and bring back such enforcement. Doing so will decimate terrorism and discourage perpetrators.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
