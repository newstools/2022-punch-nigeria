The Appeal Court at the Federal Capital Territory on Friday reserved date for the ruling on the crisis rocking the All Progressives Congress in Kano State. The All Progressives Congress Chairman, Extra Ordinary Committee and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, sought the authority of the Court of Appeal to set aside the judgment of Federal Capital Territory High Court, which validated the parallel congresses conducted by APC factional group, led by former Kano Governor, Malam Ibrahim Shekarau. Buni, alongside the APC national headquarters and other appellants insisted that the FCT High Court lacked the jurisdiction to hear the matter, thereby seeking for nullity of the lower court ruling. Justice Mu’azu Hamza of the FCT High court in November last year upheld the prayers of the Shekarau-led faction, ruled against candidates and the leadership of the party duly anointed by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje. When the matter came for hearing on Friday at the Abuja Division of the Appeal Court, legal representatives to the appellants and respondents adopted their brief arguments and counter appeal on the subject matter. The three panel Justices of the Appeal Court headed by Justice Haruna Tsammani, however, reserved the matter for judgment at a date that would be communicated to both parties.  Copyright PUNCH.
