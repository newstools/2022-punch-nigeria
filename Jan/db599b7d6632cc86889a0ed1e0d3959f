The Lagos State Government on Sunday met with the executive members of the state’s chapter of the National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives in a bid to stop the association’s planned three-day warning strike. The Lagos state chapter of NANNM had concluded plans to commence a three-day warning strike on Monday (today) to protest poor remuneration and working conditions in the state’s health sector. The state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbegba Omotoso, in an interview with our correspondent, said the government would do everything possible to stop the strike. He said, “The state government has met with them, another meeting is going to take place this evening (Sunday). From what I have learnt, the government will treat them well and make them smile. “We do not believe any part of the health sector should be left unattended to. We will continue to engage them so that there is no disruption to the system. “As we are building infrastructure, we are also building human capacity. We have done a lot for them in terms of training and welfare. If they say these are not enough, they are our people, we will listen to them. All efforts will be made to solve the issues amicably.” The secretary of the NANNM, Mr Toba Odumosu, however, said the strike would commence on Monday. “Irrespective of the meeting with the state government, there is no way we can stop the strike this evening (Sunday). We need a congress to call it off and we can’t do that until Monday,” Odumosu said.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
