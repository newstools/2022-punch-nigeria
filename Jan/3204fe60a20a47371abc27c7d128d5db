He said the gazette was long desired by the armed forces, adding that it would afford the military the opportunity to change its tactics. Irabor stressed that the development has given the fight against the bandits a global disposition, adding that it would allow the armed forces to give the bandits “the bloody nose they desire.“ He spoke while featuring on a current affairs programme, This Morning Nigeria, on Monday. Irabor said, “The issue of gazetting the bandits as terrorists is a news that is quite gladdening. That has always been what we had desired. “What it means is that our tactics, techniques and procedures that we use in handling them certainly would have to change. It might be inappropriate to begin to tell you what the details of those plans are, but I want to let you know that of course that will enable all key actors to take certain important actions. “I believe going forward, I am sure you will be reading the outcome of those engagements. “Gazetting them as terrorists gives it a global disposition that will enable other key global actors to now take certain action against them. For me, it will only get better and we will give them the bloody nose that they so desire.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
