In a bid to enhance the perspective of personnel on the effective and positive use of social media, the Directorate of Army Public Relations has taken advocacy to 8 Division Area of Responsibility. The Director, Army Public Relations, Brig.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu disclosed this in a statement on Thursday in Abuja. The General Officer Commanding 8 Division, Maj.-Gen. Uwem Bassey, urged participants to draw lessons from the workshop to be able to effectively use social media to promote the image and reputation of the Nigerian army. Bassey, who was represented by Brig.-Gen. Aminu Abdullahi, urged participants to use social media responsibly without jeopardising their personal and operational security. He further charged all to collectively mitigate the challenges associated with negative use of social media, which he said has huge implications on operational engagements and national security. The GOC commended the Directorate of Army Public Relations for seizing the initiative to embark on the advocacy drive to raise the level of awareness of the personnel. Nwachukwu said the workshop was organised to upscale the understanding of personnel on the use of social media. He said the advocacy was necessary to effectively employ social media as a force multiplier for ongoing military operations to positively change the narrative in support of the army and its operations.
