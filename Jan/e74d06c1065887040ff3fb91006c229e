While economic activities had resurrected on Mondays in Owerri, the Imo state capital after the laxity on the sit-at-home order imposed by the Indigenous People of Biafra, Orlu town and its environs have remained a shadow on itself on Mondays in the state. Our correspondent who monitored development in the state on Monday, reports that while economic activities flourished in the state capital, Orlu which had witnessed spates of killings and violence cases in the past one year was grounded. No bank, shop or any commercial activity functioned on Monday in Orlu. Few persons who came out to board buses to their various destinations were disappointed as there were no vehicles to convey them. “This place (Orlu) is very dry. No movement. They said nothing will happen till 5pm. Orlu is a ghost town as we speak. I have postponed my programme till Tuesday. Orlu is grounded and nobody is coming out. This development is very unfortunate,” A resident of Orlu told our correspondent. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
