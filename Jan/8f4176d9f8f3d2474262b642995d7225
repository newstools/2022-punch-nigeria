THE planned meeting of the All Progressives Congress governors may no longer be held on Sunday as the Director-General of the Progressives Congress Forum, Luqman Salihu, says he is not aware ofany notice of the meeting being sent to the 22 APC governors. Salihu said during a chat with Sunday PUNCH that he was not aware of any notice of the meeting. “We don’t issue our notices on the pages of newspapers. And I am currently not aware of any notice of meeting. You can quote me,” he said. Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State had revealed on Friday that the governors would be meetingon Sunday to pick a date for its convention. Lalong had said, “You know, when a convention is coming there are fears here and there. Some people will tell you it will work, it will not work. I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but the visit to the President has already assured us and you know that there is already a notice that all the governors are meeting on Sunday. By Sunday we will tell you when we’re doing the convention. “We’ve taken a date already. I think our first date before Christmas we said we’re going to do the convention in February and we are still working towards that. As far as I’m concerned, except things change from another angle. But as far as I’m concerned, we’re working for our convention in February.” The party has been enmeshed in a crisis in at least 12 state chapters leading to the emergence of  factional chairmen in the states. The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had warned recently that the APC may lose to the Peoples Democratic Party next year if it fails to put its house in order. Copyright PUNCH.
