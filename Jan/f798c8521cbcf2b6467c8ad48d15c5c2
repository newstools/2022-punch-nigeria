The head of the Oshoja royal family, Ikeja, Mr Jamiu Folami, and head of the kingmaker (Olori Oluwo), Mr Adeniyi Illo, have both said Tajudeen Muritala, whom they crowned as king is the choice of the community. Folami, in an interview with The PUNCH, said Muritala was crowned on January 21, 2022, after the throne was left vacant for nine years. He added that they took the initiative when members of the Adeleye family who were supposed to present a candidate, refused to do so. The stool of Olu of Ikeja had been vacant for nine years since the demise of Oba Rauf Matemi, Amore 1, who died in October 2014. Folami, who is the head of the Ogunseyin family, said, “We decided to pick a royal son, Tajudeen Muritala Ogunseyin because the royal house entitled to bring a royal son among the Oshoja families (Adeleye) didn’t bring anyone. “For eight years, they didn’t come up with any royal son, they were fighting among themselves. The local government also gave them six months and three months, still, they didn’t present anyone. “So, we decided to put our own son, Muritala, to become our king and nobody opposed his emergence. He has the right to become a king, he is from the Oshoja family. We wrote the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, former governor, Bola Tinubu and Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and on January 22, 2022, we installed Muritala as king of Ikeja at the shrine.” Illo explained that due to the in-fighting among the Adeleye sons, there were plans by the opposing parties to also impose one of the organisers of EndSARS, Temitope Ibikunle, as king of Ikeja.
