He said, “The faculty is one of the first faculties when the University of Lagos was established in 1962 and it has over the years produced some of the best lawyers and legal minds in the country. “This year, the university and the faculty would roll out the red carpet to celebrate the university diamond jubilee anniversary. “Our alumni have continued to give a good account of themselves in ivory towers, on the bench and bar, in the corporate world, politics and public service. “A colloquium is scheduled for Thursday, February 10 at 9am with distinguished alumni in the persons of Senator Bashir Ajibola and the Deputy Chief of Staff to the President, Ade Ipaye, amongst others speaking on stare decisis and the future of the legal practice.” Copyright PUNCH.
