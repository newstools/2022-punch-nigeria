A Federal High Court sitting in Osogbo, Osun State, has slated ruling on the preliminary objections against a suit filed on behalf of aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress in Osun State against the last ward congress of the party in the state, for Wednesday, January 26. 2,517 APC members in 26 local government areas of the state had dragged the Chairman of Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee, Governor Mai Mala-Buni, and Chairman of the Osun Ward Congress Committee, Gbenga Elegbeleye, to court. Also joined in the suit were the Chairman, Osun Ward Congress Appeal Committee, Obed Wadzani, APC Osun chapter, and the Independent National Electoral Commission. However, during Friday’s proceedings, counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr Mahmud Adesina, SAN, insisted that the court had jurisdiction to entertain and rule on the matter. Adesina also said the congress conducted by the plaintiffs was the valid one, and declared as illegal the exercise conducted by the defendants. But while responding, counsel for the APC and the party’s national caretaker chairman, Dr Mubaraq Adekilekun, said the court lacked jurisdiction, adding that the issues arising from the congress were basically party affairs that should not be meddled into by the court. Adekilekun also said Mala-Buni, being a sitting governor, enjoyed immunity, while noting that a matter concerning large number of people could not be brought before the court in representative capacity. Having listened to argument and counter argument by the parties, Justice Emmanuel Ayoola, adjourned the matter till Wednesday, January 26, for ruling on the jurisdiction and other objections.
