The chairman of Warri South Local Government Area of Delta State, Dr Michael Tidi, has waded into the crisis between Hausa traders and Ugbuwangue community in the council area. PUNCH Metro gathered that there were skirmishes involving Hausa traders and youths of Ugbuwangue community over a misunderstanding that led to a breakdown of law and order in the community on Monday. The council chairman, in a statement issued on Tuesday by his Special Assistant on Media, Mr Francis Sadhere, however, noted that peace had since been restored to the community. According to the statement, “All parties have been called to the round table and have all agreed to sheath their sword for peace to reign.” The council chairman, therefore, urged residents within the area to go about their normal businesses as security agents have been deployed to maintain law and order in the community. He added that stakeholders meeting will be held to ensure there is a permanent solution to the matter even as investigation is ongoing to unravel the root cause of the fracas. Tidi stated further, “As the number one security officer of Warri South Council Area, I want to assure residents that the council is doing all within its power to ensure that permanent peace returns to the community. “I want to urge residents and traders in Ugbuwangue community to go about their normal businesses as the council has put all necessary measures in place to forestall a reoccurrence of what happened. “Residents of Ugbuwangue community are peace-loving people who have been living peacefully with the Hausa traders for years.” Copyright PUNCH.
