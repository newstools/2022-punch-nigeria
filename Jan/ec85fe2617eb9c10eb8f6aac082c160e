A former beauty queen and Nollywood star, Regina Askia, has gifted a new car to her daughter, Teesa, who recently turned 20 years old. The proud mother, who is now a New York-based nurse, noted that she had promised to buy her daughter a car. Teesa turned 20 years on January 3, 2022 and in fulfilling her promise, Askia gifted her child a brand new car. Sharing a picture of the car, the proud mother said, “A belated birthday present, a promise kept. Because my little girl kept her promise to stay in college, get a job and do the right thing. “May this car be the beginning of many great adventures for you, in God’s safety and protection. Love you always. (Please, join your prayers here to bless Ms T’s first car with me, thank you).” The former beauty queen also shared a video where she presented the car to the excited 20-year-old.
