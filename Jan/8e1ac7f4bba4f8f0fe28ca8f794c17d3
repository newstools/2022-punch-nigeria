A popular artiste, Teniola Akpata, aka Teni, escaped a mob attack while performing at an event in Buguma town, in the Asari-Toru Local Government Area of Rivers State. In a trending video on social media, the singer was performing one of her hit tracks, Super Power, when hell was let loose as gunshots rent the air. The ear-splitting gunshots sent everyone scampering to safety. PUNCH Metro gathered that Teni was invited to perform at a carnival which was going on smoothly before the incident occurred. According to the video, suspected hoodlums pelt the artiste with bottles while she sang, a situation that attracted the attention of security operatives. The acting spokesman for the state police command, Grace Iringe-Koko, confirmed the incident, but said Teni was rescued unhurt. “She was invited for a carnival where she was performing; some miscreants started throwing stones and all that. “But the police and other security agencies were on ground to ensure nothing happened and the command has started an investigation into the incident to ascertain what really happened. “The police division there in Buguma has been mandated to fish out those behind the attack. We will ensure they are brought to book,” she stated. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
