The Nigeria Customs Service, Kebbi Area Command, has intercepted 150 drums of petrol and 389 kilogrammes of cannabis sativa worth N21,180,000. The seizures, according to a statement on Sunday by the command’s spokesperson, DSC Nasiru Manga, were recorded within one week. Manga disclosed that the seizures were recorded at two separate locations within the state based on credible intelligence. The statement read, “Operatives of the command, while on patrol on Wednesday, January 5, 2022, along Kyangakwai-Kamba Road, intercepted a blue Carina E with number plate, UBT 674 MQ, and chassis number, SB1645BK10E009725, loaded with cannabis sativa, popularly known as Indian hemp. “A physical examination of the vehicle revealed that it was loaded with 389 parcels of 1kg each of cannabis sativa valued at N15,560,000. “Similarly, based on credible intelligence, officers and men of the Kebbi Area Command on Friday, 7th January, 2022, scuttled the activities of daredevil smugglers of premium motor spirit at the Lowcoast Waterway in Yauri and consequently evacuated 150 drums equivalent to 30,000 litres of PMS, which were meant to be smuggled out of the country through waterways, valued at N4,860,000.” The Area Controller, Comptroller Hafiz Kalla, lamented how a few “unscrupulous elements take advantage of the humungous amount of money paid by the government as a subsidy to Nigerians to divert the product for their selfish reasons, thereby sabotaging government effort.”  Copyright PUNCH.
