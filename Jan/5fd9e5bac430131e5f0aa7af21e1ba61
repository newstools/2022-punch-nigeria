There was panic amongst the people of Ubudom Atta community in the Njaba Local Government Area of Imo state as unidentified gunmen beheaded a 65 -year- old man, identified as Nnoruoka Onyeokwu. After beheading the man, his head was displayed at the primary school in the community. The incident which happened on Saturday had caused further panic in the community which had witnessed spates of violence and killings since last year. A community leader who confided in our correspondent on Monday said that the victim was attacked in his house in the night and the villagers woke up the next day to see his severed head dangling at the premises of the primary school in the village. The source said, “The man was attacked at night in his house. People woke up the next morning to see his cut-off head displayed at the primary school. Nobody knew those who attacked him or why he was beheaded. The community is in a state of panic. People are running away because of the fear of the unknown. This is very unfortunate.” The spokesperson for the police in the state, Micheal Abattam, had yet to respond to an inquiry on the murder incident as of the time of filing this report. This comes barely a month after the traditional ruler of the community, Edwin Azike, was kidnapped in the community on December 8 and his corpse dumped at the market square the next day. Gunmen had also in June attacked and burnt a police Division headquarters, Magistrate’s court, and a health centre in the community. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
