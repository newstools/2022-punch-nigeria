The Indigenous People of Biafra has said that it would soon showcase the achievements it has recorded so far in the freedom struggle. It has therefore mobilised its members ahead of the next court appearance of its detained leader, Nnamdi Kanu. In a statement on Wednesday, the group’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Mr Emma Powerful, said the struggle would continue unless the Federal Government releases their leader, Nnamdi Kanu, unconditionally. The group assured its followers that the struggle this year would record more successes than the previous years. The statement read, “The leadership of IPOB has given an order for all IPOB family across the world to activate the protest to show our anger towards the illegal abduction and extraordinary rendition of our leader from Kenya to Nigeria. “To this end, we want to inform all Biafrans to get ready to solidarise with our leader as usual, in his next court appearance scheduled for January 18, 19 and 20. “It is on record that the Kenyan government has openly confessed that kidnapping and extra-rendition of our leader was unlawful and we must leverage on that confession and protest his abduction and rendition by the Nigerian government in collaboration with her allies. “Fulani cows are banned in Biafraland starting from April 2022. Those in the animal husbandry business must switch over to our native cow without delay.” The group also restated its position on the recitation of the national anthem. It added, “We want every school student to start reciting Biafra’s national anthem and soon, all schools will receive copies of Biafra’s national anthem.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
