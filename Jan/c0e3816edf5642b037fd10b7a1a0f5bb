The Lagos State Government has tasked the newly appointed members of the state Christian Pilgrims Welfare Board to work together in order to fulfil their assignments. The Commissioner for Home Affairs, Mr Anofiu Elegushi, made this call on Wednesday in his address to the governing members of the LSCPWB in Alausa, Ikeja. “Your appointment is a demonstration of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s confidence in your antecedents and track record of integrity, impeccable character, competence, experience and passion for public service. In this regard, we expect the board members and the management to work in collaboration and synergy to ensure that you fulfil your individual and collective assignments in order to achieve the THEMES agenda of Mr governor.” The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Mr Sewedo Whenu, said the Christian Pilgrims Welfare Board was the preferred choice of most pilgrims in the state. “The CPWB is the preferred choice of most pilgrims in Lagos and beyond due to the international best practices adopted by the management of the board and I am certain with your appointment, the activities and performance level will be increased and move the LSCPWB to greater levels,” he said. The Chairman of LSCPWB, Bishop Akinpelu Johnson, thanked the governor for the appointment and promised to work with everyone to take the board to greater heights.  Copyright PUNCH.
