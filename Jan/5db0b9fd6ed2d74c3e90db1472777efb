The Commissioner of Police, Rivers State Command, Friday Eboka, has vowed to arrest the 19 persons declared wanted by the state governor, Nyesom Wike, over their alleged involvement in illegal bunkering. He, however, said the command was still waiting for the list of the affected persons. Eboka gave the assurance while answering questions from journalists in Port Harcourt, the state capital on Tuesday. The PUNCH reported that Wike had, in his New Year message, declared the suspects wanted and advised them to submit themselves to the state police command immediately. The police boss however said though the command has yet to get the list of the wanted persons, strategies have been mapped out to ensure their arrest. He said, “Actually, I heard it from the news that some people have been declared wanted by the state government but we are still expecting to get the list so that we can work on them. “We don’t want to act on what we heard on the radio, but by the time we get the list, we will go after them. “I want to assure you that they will be arrested and prosecuted if we have evidence to prosecute them.” Meanwhile, the state taskforce on street trading, illegal markets and motor parks has impounded dispatch motorcycles, umbrella, wheelbarrows and other items. Chairman of the taskforce, Felix Nwadibe, disclosed this while speaking with journalists after an operation in Port Harcourt. Nwadibe said the operation was to enforce the directive of the governor, saying anyone found wanting would not be spared. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
