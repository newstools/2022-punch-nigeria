The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, has deployed additional policemen from Abuja to Ekiti State to complement personnel on the ground in the state to ensure hitch-free primary elections of the Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressives Congress. The state Commissioner of Police, Tunde Mobayo, disclosed this on Tuesday, saying the move was “in a bid to maintain serene atmosphere and free, fair and credible governorship primary elections of the PDP and the APC.” While 11 aspirants are jostling for the PDP ticket during the indirect primary billed for Wednesday, eight aspirants are contesting for the APC’s ticket in the direct primary which will hold on Thursday. Mobayo, in a statement by the state Police Public Relations Officer, Sunday Abutu, titled “Governorship primaries – Ekiti State CP deploys adequate security, sues for peace,” reiterated the command’s readiness and deployment of adequate personnel to all voting centres and other relevant places across the state. The police boss confirmed what he called “the incredible approval and deployment of additional manpower for the elections from the Force Headquarters, Abuja, by the IGP, Baba, to complement and support the personnel on ground.” Mobayo, who warned against all forms of electoral malpractices and violence throughout the period of the elections, assured all stakeholders of adequate security before, during and after the elections as he charged the personnel deployed “to be professional and avoid all forms of corrupt practices while discharging their duties.”  Copyright PUNCH.
