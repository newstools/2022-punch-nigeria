The abductors of a former governorship aspirant in Plateau State, Kemi Nshe, have refused to release him more than one week after he was kidnapped. The kidnappers, it was gathered, also rejected the sum of N7m as ransom to enable Nshe, who was abducted alongside a lecturer of the Plateau State University, Monday Hassan, to regain his freedom. Disclosing this to The PUNCH in Jos on Sunday, sources familiar with the third party said to be negotiating with the abductors said, “It is now more than one week and the kidnappers are still holding him (Nshe). The kidnappers have also not released the lecturer friend abducted alongside him. Can you imagine that they have refused to collect the N7m offered to them to release the victims? The kidnappers said the amount was small and that they wanted more. “The situation is something I cannot understand. But the negotiators are still pleading with them to have mercy on the two persons and free them, because you can imagine what the families have gone through to raise the said N7m under the present economic hardship in the country.” The PUNCH reports that gunmen had in the early hours of last week Saturday abducted Nshe, a former Chairman of the Shendam Local Government Area, from his residence in Shendam. Nshe, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, was with his guest, Hassan, who is the branch Chairman of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, Plateau State University chapter, when the gunmen stormed the house and whisked them away to an unknown destination. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Ubah Ogaba, said everything was being done by the command to rescue the victims and arrest the perpetrators.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
