Former Big Brother Naija contestant, Ka3na, has warned ladies that they should be careful who they build their lives with because they could be used and dumped. The controversial reality TV star whose real name is Kate Jones, posted on her official Twitter page, “Be careful who you build with. People will use you for the foundation and finish the structure with someone else. Choose the latter, be the one to move in.” She implied that a relationship was a game that one needed to be careful in investing in the life and growth of the partner, because the partner may become better and then move on to another person. Reacting to her tweet, a fan, @Kimberly, wrote, “They still dey build? My future is bright. Avoid me please!” Supporting the reality TV star, another fan, @nnenna8541, wrote “You have spoken the truth today.” There have been lingering rumours that Ka3na has split with Mr. Jones, her long-time white husband for reasons yet to be disclosed. The rumour was sparked by a recent Instagram post where she wrote, “Miss Ka3na please, not searching.” The mother-of-one recently celebrated her sixth wedding anniversary with her husband.
