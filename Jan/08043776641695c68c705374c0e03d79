Reality TV star, Nina Onyenobi, on Monday noted that Zazoo Zeh, a popular song by fast rising singer, Portable, was overhyped. The song, which featured award-winning singer, Olamide, and Poco Lee, hit the airwaves a few weeks ago. Taking to her Instagram story on Monday, Nina noted that fans were overhyping the song because she couldn’t understand what the singer, Portable, was saying. The former Big Brother Naija contestant shared a video of herself in her car as the song was playing in the background. In the video, she said, “I feel like you guys are overhyping this song because I’ve been trying so hard to understand what this guy is singing. It’s not working.” Zazoo Zeh has recorded massive success as it has become very popular in parties, clubs, and online videos. There are also several covers and remixes to the song, as its title has become a general street slang. Born Habeeb Okikiola, Portable has received a major breakthrough from the song and received two cars last week from fans. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
