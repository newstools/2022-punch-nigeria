The All Progressives Congress has described the death of former Oyo State Governor, Chief Adebayo Alao-Akala, as a loss of a national political asset. This is according to a condolence message signed late Wednesday by the Chairman, APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Mai Mala Buni. According to Buni, “The APC has received with sorrow the death of Otunba Alao-Akala, former Governor of Oyo State and APC chieftain in the state. It is with grief and sorrow that we lost His Excellency Alao Akala at this moment of our national life. “Akala was a man of the people who increased the fortunes of the party in Oyo State and Nigeria. The late Governor was a national political asset that was sought after by all political parties. “It is saddening that we lost this asset at a time when we commence the process to our next general election.” Buni, who condoled with the Alao-Akala family, the government and the people of Oyo State also prayed to God to grant the deceased eternal rest.
