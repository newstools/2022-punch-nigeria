Villarreal winger Samuel Chukwueze says the Super Eagles are not yet favourites to win the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations title, adding that there’s still work to be done to win a fourth title in Cameroon. Chukwueze, who was on target in the Eagles’ 3-1 win over Sudan on Saturday, said coach Austin Eguavoen has instilled in the players self-belief, which he believes will help them at the tournament. “People think we are the favourites but I don’t think so yet, we should continue to work hard. We have to take each game as it comes and as long as we continue to follow the coach’s instructions, we can win the cup,” Chukwueze told The PUNCH on Sunday in Garoua. “The team is doing well at the moment and I think what we should do now is to keep our heads down and keep working hard. “The coach is doing well, he believes in us and as far we believe in ourselves, the sky will be starting point.” The 22-year-old added that he had set for himself a goalscoring target and assists at the tournament. “I need to get more goals and assist, I need to do more for the success of the team, it is not only one goal that I will score at this tournament, I already set my target for the tournament, the goals and assists I need to get.” He added that the Eagles would have scored more goals at the AFCON if Napoli striker Victor Osimhen was at the tournament. Osimhen pulled out of the tournament due to injury and COVID-19. When our correspondent asked if he missed his former U-17 and U-20 teammate, the Diamond Academy graduate said, “Nobody will not miss Victor because he is a beast on the field of play, I miss him. “I wish he was here, I think by now we would have been scoring three to four goals, so many goals.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
