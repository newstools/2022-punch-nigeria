The Lagos State Government has urged citizens to explore alternative medicine in addition to conventional medicine in order to attain complete wellness. The Chairman, Lagos State Traditional Medicine Board, Prof Adebukunola Adefule-Ositelu, made this call in a statement on Wednesday. Adebukunola-Ositelu was quoted to have said this during the opening tour of the NatureCanFixYou clinic in Ikeja. She said, “Many people are using herbs and so many things that are traditional, but are not bold enough to let others know. “Traditional medicine is what our forefathers and mothers used to take care of themselves and they were fine before conventional medicine came to be. God had endowed us in this continent and our traditional medicine practice is in envy of the whole world today. “The collaboration between conventional and traditional research as well as regulations by the government are needed to move traditional medicine forward in Nigeria.” The Registrar of LSTMB, Mr Olorunkemi Kadiku, said conventional medicine had its limitations which should be complemented. “Conventional medicine does not have the solution to all ailments, hence the need for the alternative medicine which comes as an option for treatment of any ailment,” he said. The Managing Director of NatureCanFixYou Clinic, Mrs Abisola Kadiku, said natural medicine provides the option of medical treatment with little or no side effects.
