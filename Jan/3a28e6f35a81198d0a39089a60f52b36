The Nigeria Golf Federation has unveiled 95-year-old Pa James Omolaso as the oldest Nigerian golfer. The NGF, led by Otunba Olusegun Runsewe, presented London-based Omolaso after he had a few holes at the IBB International Golf and Country Club, Abuja. Omolaso visited Abuja from his UK base when he was discovered. The 28-handicapper plays at Greenwich Estuary Golf Course near 02 Arena, London, and has been playing the game for the past 35 years. Omolaso said he had always been invoilved in sports from his time in college in Nigeria. “Normally, I do exercises, play and watch television and do pep talk with my children. I also watch Formula One as well as flip to nearly all sports channels. Generally, I am interested in sports, because I was a sportsperson at Molusi College, Ijebu Igbo. I was one of the foundation members of the school,” Omolaso said. He advised people who wanted to live long to exercise regularly and care for other people. He also tasked Nigerian professional golfers to work hard and exhibit confidence, adding that they would be internationally recognised if they imbibed the right attitude. Otunba Runsewe, who discovered the nonagenarian, urged Nigerians to key into the game of golf, saying it could be played at any age. “Pa Omolaso is 95 and still comes on the course to play some few holes and makes some putts. The fact that Baba has mental alertness and understands what golf is tells us that golf is an ageless game. Today, he has demonstrated something: that when you hit a good golf shot, your entire body chemistry communicates.’’ Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
