A group, the Coalition of Civil Society Groups on Monday held rallies at the national secretariats of the Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressives Congress in Abuja. The organisation appealed to both parties to zone their presidential ticket to the South, saying this would guarantee sustainable peace, national unity and strengthen the nation’s democracy. Speaking during the rallies, the CCSG President, Bassey Williams argued that since the inception of democracy, the nation has witnessed a rotational presidency between the North and South just to keep the polity stable. He said, “We are convinced that power should naturally rotate between the Northern and Southern region of the country. We also believe that it is by the avowed commitment to this arrangement that we can stop the current ethnographic-religious division being experienced in the country. “Our visit today is to lend our voice in support of the call for power shift to the southern part of Nigeria. We hereby urge the great men and women of the PDP and APC to heed this patriotic call. “It is on the strength of this that we march here today in our thousands to submit our position on the imperatives of a presidential candidate of southern Nigeria extraction come 2023 on the platforms of the PDP and APC. On power rotation, we stand.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
