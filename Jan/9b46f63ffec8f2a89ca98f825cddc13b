Some Nigerian fans have called on the Nigeria Football Federation to stick with indigenous coaches after the performance of Austin Eguavoen at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. The NFF appointed Eguavoen to take charge of the Super Eagles on an interim basis after the country parted ways with long-serving coach, Gernot Rohr, in December. The coach steered the team to three wins from three games in the group stage, winning all three matches to qualify for the Round of 16 in style. They however crashed out of the competition on Sunday after a 1-0 loss to Tunisia in the Round of 16. One of the fans OluwaSegun Sam wrote on Twitter, “Super Eagles have been a source of joy in the last few weeks. Gave us hope to believe in the team again and believe in the local coaches. One bad game shouldn’t stop us believing in the Super Eagles.” Adenrele Babatunde stated, “They’re the real problem. We keep getting coaches that are just an upgrade to our indigenous coaches. We can send those local coaches abroad or get them the best training here. I still believe we have capable hands.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
