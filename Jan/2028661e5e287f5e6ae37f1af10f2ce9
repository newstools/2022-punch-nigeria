There was a bloody clash on Thursday in Bayelsa State between suspected rival supporters of the Commissioner for Education, Gentle Emelah, and the member representing Yenagoa Constituency 1 in the state House of Assembly, Oforji Oboku. It was gathered that the incident happened around a building opposite the Kpansia Market along the Sani Abacha Expressway in Yenagoa, the state capital. The loyalists of Emelah were said to have converged on the venue awaiting the arrival of their principal to address them when the supporters of Oboku reportedly stormed the area and launched an attack. Both the commissioner and the lawmaker hail from the same Yenagoa Local Government Area and are said to be nursing the ambition of contesting the House of Representatives seat in the 2023 general elections. While Oboku is from Epie-Atissa, which he represents in the state Assembly, Emelah, a former member of the Assembly, is from the Okordia/Zarama/Biseni axis, which constitutes Yenagoa Constituency 3. The two of them are members of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party in the state. Emelah’s supporters were said to be drumming and singing when the legislator’s boys allegedly attacked them, resulting in a free-for-all which led to injuries and a car set ablaze. Copyright PUNCH.
