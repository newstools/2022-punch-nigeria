The pan-Northern socio-political organisation, Arewa Consultative Forum, has hailed the military onslaught which led to the death of two bandits, Alhaji Auta and Kachalla Luga, in Zamfara State. The ACF, in a statement by its National Chairman and former of Minister of Agriculture, Chief Audu Ogbeh, in Kaduna on Monday, showered encomiums on the officers and men of the Nigerian Air Force that carried out the aerial bombardment of the bandits’ hideouts which neutralised the bandits and many of their followers. According to the organisation, the Nigerian Air Force and other gallant fighters should maintain the onslaught until the terrorists surrender. Ogbeh said, “The Arewa Consultative Forum would like to commend the Nigerian military, particularly the Nigerian Air Force for raids it carried out recently against terrorist elements. “Last weekend for instance, the Air Force carried out an offensive which led to the deaths of two notorious bandit leaders, Alhaji Auta and Kachalla Luga, in Zamfara. “Many of their followers were also killed in the operation codenamed Hadarin Daji. “We urge the Air Force and all our gallant fighters to maintain the current onslaught until the terrorists surrender. It is only when such tempo is maintained that the leadership can be assured of the morale of our fighting men. “We assure our fighting men that victory is in sight and they should not despair.” Copyright PUNCH.
