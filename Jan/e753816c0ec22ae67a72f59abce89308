The Nigerian Customs Service, Kebbi Area Command, has said it impounded prohibited goods worth N118, 944,926.00, in 154 seizures in 2021. The sum of N13,181,500 was equally generated as revenue from the auction sales of 128, 750 litres of PMS/AGO and other perishable items seized by the command in accordance with extant laws. The Area Controller, Comptroller Hafiz Kalla, who stated these during a press briefing at the command headquarters, said the funds were remitted to the Federal Government coffers. The seized items include 1,583 bags of 50kg and 10 bags of 25kg of foreign parboiled rice, 299 packages of 1kg of Indian hemp, 253 bales of secondhand clothing and 1,603 pieces of new textile materials. The rest include one tanker loaded with 50,000 litres of PMS, five units of vehicles and 111 pieces of used tyres. Kalla said, “The seizure records for the year ended when compared with 2020, shows a sharp decline in the frequency of smuggling and items smuggled. “For instance, while the command made a total number of 234 seizures in 2020, the frequency of smuggling recorded in 2021 was 154, which suggests a 35% decline in the rate of smuggling. “The quantity of recorded foreign parboiled rice smuggled into the state compared with 2020, dropped by 20% in 2021, suggesting that our eagle-eyed officers are winning the war against rice smugglers in the state.” The comptroller acknowledged the contributions of the customs leadership, including officers and men of the command, as well as the support of other units in the service and relevant security agencies. “Just within the first week of this year, our gallant officers were able to make spectacular seizures of 389kg of cannabis along Kamba Road and were able to scuttle the activities of PMS smugglers on our waterways in Yauri, thereby evacuating 150 drums of PMS, equivalent to 30,000 litres. The two seizures are worth N21,180,000,” Kalla stated. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
