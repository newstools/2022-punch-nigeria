The Coalition of Northern Groups has criticised the Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, for saying residents in the North-East are currently sleeping with their two eyes closed. In a statement signed by the Special Adviser to the Senate President on Media and Publicity, Ola Awoniyi, on Sunday, Buni hailed the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) for his untiring efforts at restoring peace and normalcy to the troubled North-East. But reacting, the spokesperson for CNG, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, said, “If Buni, a governor in one of the most vulnerable states in North, has said that the North sleeps with both eyes closed, then it is unfortunate. This has definitely confirmed the long-held concern that most governors, particularly in the northern states, either live in isolation or are in deep and deliberate denial. “It also proves that leaders such as this are the ones who are blocking the President from fully appreciating the magnitude of the problems facing the country around security and the economy. While it may not be out of place to say that before the coming of this administration, virtually the entire North was a battlefront, and the nation was a hostage of Boko Haram, today there is a vastly improved atmosphere in North-East states with Boko Haram pinned to enclaves. “It is, however, a gross exaggeration and untruth to say that the whole of northern Nigeria is so safe that people sleep with their eyes closed.” Suleiman added that it was a serious problem when elected leaders place more premium on the dictates of their personal political expediency at the expense of the welfare of the people they lead.
