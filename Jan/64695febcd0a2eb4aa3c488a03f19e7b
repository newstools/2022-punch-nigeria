A 25-year old housewife, Aminat AbduLateef, who was recently delivered of a triplet at Osun State Hospital, Ede, on Sunday called on well-meaning Nigerians for assistance. AbduLateef, in a chat with The PUNCH, said she was delivered of the babies through caesarean session. She said beside medical consumables that were bought, out of N55,000 bill given to her by the hospital, N45, 000 had been paid through the help of relations. She added that her husband, a member of a vigilante group, Qowiyu Akinloye, who could have been of help, had been in detention in Ilesa Custodial Centre after he was arrested on May 13, 2021 during a public fight in Ede. She said, “My husband is a member of vigilante group. He was innocent, but he was called for settlement of a dispute in Ede during a public fight and he went there. He has been in detention in Ilesa since May 13, 2021. “I delivered the baby through caesarean session. They are my first. I was barely pregnant when my husband was arrested. My family and relatives have been assisting me, but I need assistance from well meaning Nigerians to pay the hospital bills and take care of the babies.” Also speaking with our correspondent, elder sister to the father of the triplets, Jelifat Akinloye, said apart from the hospital bill, the babies had been placed on special food which the family could not afford. She said, “The babies are very small and special food has been recommended for them. A tin of the food will cost N3, 000. “We really need help from government and well-meaning individuals to take care of the babies and to get my brother out of detention. He is innocent of the charges against him.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
