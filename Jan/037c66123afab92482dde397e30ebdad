A road crash on Friday night along the Obinaetiti Akwuzu junction by Nteje-Onitsha Expressway claimed the life of one person. According to eyewitness account, two vehicles were involved in the accident. An unidentified driver of a blue Mercedes 911 with Registration Number XA129AWK and another one driving a Honda Accord car with Registration Number RBX155PC were said to be involved in the accident. The probable cause of the crash was attributed to obstruction and speeding. The eyewitness said the accident occurred when the driver of the Honda car, driving on a high speed, hit the Mercedes Benz 911 from behind. The driver of the Mercedes Benz 911 had sighted a heap of sand and gravel on the road and slowed down to avoid it while the driver of the Honda car, who did not watch, rammed into the vehicle. The sand, it was learnt, belonged to a construction company. “Three male adults were involved in the crash, two persons survived unhurt while one person died,” the eyewitness said. As of the time of filing this report, the dead victim had been deposited at the Wisdom Mortuary, Awkuzu. The truck was taken to the Federal Road Safety Corps office at Nteje, while efforts were being made by the rescue team to clear the obstruction. The FRSC Sector Commander in the state, Adeoye Irelewuyi, commiserated with the family of the dead victim. He warned the motoring public to desist from speeding and be at alert while driving. “Traffic rules and regulations must be obeyed at all times,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
