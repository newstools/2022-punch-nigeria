A 33-year-old man, Adekunle Samson, who was charged with rape, has been discharged and acquitted by an Ekiti State High Court sitting in Ado Ekiti three years after. The defendant was arraigned before the court on November 5, 2019 on one count of rape. The charge read, “Adekunle Samson, on April 25, 2018, at Ise Ekiti, did rape one Yemi, contrary to Section 358 of the Criminal Code Law, Cap. C16, Law of Ekiti State, 2012.” The police prosecutor, Richard Olowoyo, called three witnesses and tendered a medical report and a cutlass as exhibits. But the defendant, who spoke through his lawyer and called no witness, pleaded not guilty. In his judgment, Justice Bamidele Omotoso said, “I have come to the conclusion that the prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt the allegation of rape against the defendant. “I found as a fact that there existed an amorous relationship between the defendant and the victim prior to the incident and that alleged sexual intercourse which prompted the police to arrest the defendant and arraign him before this court was done with the consent of the victim. In conclusion, the defendant, Adekunle Samson, is hereby discharged and acquitted of the offence of rape.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
