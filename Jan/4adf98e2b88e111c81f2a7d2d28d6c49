Operatives of the Ogun State Social Orientation and Safety Corps, aka So-Safe Corps, have arrested a suspected notorious kidnap kingpin, Bature Ibrahim, in the Oke-Ogun area of the state. Ibrahim, who was arrested on Saturday, was alleged to have been responsible for the unrest along the Olorunda-Imala Road in the Abeokuta-North Local Government Area of the state. The Commander of the Corps, Soji Ganzallo, stated these in a statement by the Director of Information of the agency, Moruf Yusuf, on Sunday. He said, “Operatives of the corps were instructed to secure identified black spots across the state and revisit the records of suspected kidnappers to effect their arrests. “Bature Ibrahim was arrested on Saturday, January 15, 2022 at 6.05am along the Olorunda-Imala Road in his attempt to escape through Olorunda town after he heard that his name was mentioned by his counterparts, who were in the custody of the Nigeria Police Anti-Kidnapping Department, Eleweran, Ogun State. “The suspect and the items found on him, clothes and cash, were handed over to the police anti-kidnapping department same day for further investigation and likely prosecution.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
