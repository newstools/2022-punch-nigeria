Reacting to his death, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), described Tahir, who was also the Chairman, Board of National Commission of Nomadic Education, as a “well-respected” scholar. In a condolence message by his media aide, Malam Garba Shehu, on Thursday in Abuja, the president noted that the late professor made tremendous innovation and contributions to basic education and teacher training in the country. The president believed that Tahir left the scene when Nigeria needed his wise counsel, expertise and patriotic services most. He stated that the nation would continue to treasure and build on the successful skill set, research and policy development, deposited in his students, professional networks, journals and publications. ”The late UBEC chairman was not only a distinguished academic, but also an accomplished administrator who had used his vast knowledge to add value to the public offices that he held. ”Despite his illustrious public service record and accomplishments, Tahir was an incredibly humble man who didn’t allow power and social status to go to his head,” he stated.
