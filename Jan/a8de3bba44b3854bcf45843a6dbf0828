American businesswoman and Hilton empire heiress, Paris Hilton, had lauded Chess In Slum founder, Tunde Onakoya, for his humanitarian works. Onakoya caught Hilton’s attention on Monday after tweeting about a boy he adopted from the slums of Ikorodu, Lagos, who was resuming school. “About a year ago, I found this little boy in the slums of Ikorodu picking scrap from the floor. I adopted him and he has lived with me ever since then. Today is his first day in school. He aced his entrance examination and will be starting from Primary One,” he wrote. An associate of Onakoya, @AdeleyeOuwako1 who works for the non-profit organisation also posted a video of the boy, with the caption, “What love cannot transform doesn’t exist.” “Y’all need to see the joy in his face when he came to wake me up from bed this morning, saying Uncle Korayy, I’m ready for school. Proud to be part of this journey with @chessinslums x @Tunde_OD,” he wrote. Responding to Adeleye’s tweet, Hilton wrote, “Love this, and God bless you both.” Hilton further shared a picture of the organisation’s Twitter page and the channels for donation. In a tweet, Onakoya thanked the heiress for advocating their cause. “My pleasure. Thank you for what you are doing to help these children. May God always bless you,” she replied. Chess In Slum Africa was founded by Babatunde Onakoya in 2018. The organisation aims at providing mentorship and unlocking the potential in underprivileged children using Chess educational resources. In December, The PUNCH reported that the organization carried out a Chess tournament at Oshodi under-bridge, Lagos, which saw 19-year-old Adeoye Fawas emerging as the winner. Copyright PUNCH.
