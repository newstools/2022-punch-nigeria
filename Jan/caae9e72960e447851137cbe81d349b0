About 10 Tunisian players are likely to miss their round of 16 encounter against Nigeria at the Roumdé Adjia Stadium in Garoua on Sunday due to COVID-19 and suspension. The Eagles of Carthage qualified for the knock-out phase as one of the four best losers after losing two out of three games in Group F. The Tunisians have been plagued by major COVID-19 concerns but have recently been boosted by the return of four players from isolation- Oussama Haddadi, Ali Jemal, Mohamed Drager and Naim Sliti. However, the team will be without Wahbi Khazri who grabbed a brace in their 4-0 thrashing of Mauritania, Dylan Bronn, Ghaylène Chaalali, Mohamed Romdhane, Ali Maâloul, Ben Hmida, Aymen Dahmen, Yoann Touzghar, and Issam Jebali, who are still in isolation, while goalkeeper Issam Jebali has been suspended. The Tunisians will be hoping to have more players return against in-form Nigeria. The North Africans arrived in Garoua on Friday for the game and will have their first training on Saturday (today). Both sides last met at the AFCON in a third-place fixture of the 2019 tournament in 2019 with Al Shabab striker Odion Ighalo scoring the only goal of the encounter. Tournament rules state that if a game must proceed, 11 players must be available — even if no recognised goalkeeper is among those fit and in the case where an opposition cannot provide 11 players, the game will be forfeited with the opposition deemed to have won the game 2-0.
