The Lagos Waste Management Authority has commenced the clearing of illegal dumpsites at Apapa, in a bid to ensure all black spots in the area are free of wastes. The Managing Director of LAWMA, Mr Ibrahim Odumboni, said this in a statement on Tuesday. He said, “The agency had mobilised men, trucks, pay-loaders and other necessary materials for the exercise after overcoming a major challenge of vehicular access to the Tin Can Island Port along Apapa-Oshodi Expressway, which had previously prevented the evacuation of wastes. “No fewer than 15 truckloads of refuse have already been carted away to the Olusosun landfill since the operation began on Wednesday at black spots that were turned to dumpsites by residents and traders operating illegal markets in the axis. “This exercise would be a continuous one, and it is aimed at mitigating the challenge of indiscriminate dumping of refuse experienced in the Apapa axis and other parts of the state.” Odumboni also appealed to residents of the state to shun the act of indiscriminate waste disposal. “Our advocacy team was on the ground during the exercise to sensitise residents on the need to imbibe effective waste management as a way of life. LAWMA is totally committed to ensuring that every nook and cranny of the state is rid of illegal dumpsites as we usher in the New Year. We, therefore, appeal to residents to shun the act of indiscriminate waste disposal in view of its attendant negative consequences,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
