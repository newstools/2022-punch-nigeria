A gubernatorial aspirant of the People’s Democratic Party in the party’s January 26 Ekiti State primary, Chief Segun Oni, has condemned the attack on the state party secretariat, describing it as “condemnable and barbaric”. Oni, in a statement he signed and made available to newsmen in Ado-Ekiti on Thursday, slammed the attack in its totality. He said, “It is a barbaric and heartless attack purposely directed at the party secretariat. “The attackers need to be told that such will never stop the party from attaining victory in the June 18, governorship election.” Oni, a former governor of the state, called for urgent steps to ensure adequate security to safeguard lives and property during the electioneering. He said that the people of Ekiti were on the move with the PDP in their readiness to snatch victory in the forthcoming election “The vandalism of the secretariat was an action taken too far; partakers of this action should be brought to book,” he said. When the News Agency of Nigeria called the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Sunday Abutu, on phone he said that he had yet to receive any information on the alleged attack. “Anytime the command receives the information and confirm the attack, I will on behalf of the Commissioner of Police, Mr Babatunde Mobayo, address the press,” he stated.
