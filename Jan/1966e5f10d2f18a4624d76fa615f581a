Nollywood actor, Femi Adebayo, and his siblings have gifted their mother a new car as the latter clocked 70 years on Thursday. The actor took to his Instagram story to share a picture of the car, with the caption, “For our mother. We love you mum.” Femi’s father and veteran actor, Adebayo Salami, also reposted the picture on his Instagram page, with the caption, “Alhamdulillah for the blessings of family. Thank you, my children.” While celebrating his mother, Femi Adebayo partly wrote, “My mother is many things but top on the list is ‘Love’.
She embodies the true meaning and definition of love. “She’s the true definition of ‘if I no chop, my mother no go chop.’It is my everyday prayer that if I have to come to this world 10 million times, the Almighty should make me come through her. Mummy, I love you so much. “In Sha Allah, I will celebrate your 120 years in this world in good health and abundance of blessings. Ejide, we all love you. Continue to grow in health and peace of mind.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
