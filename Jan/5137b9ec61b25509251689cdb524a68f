Teebillz, who was married to Nigerian singer, Tiwa Savage, took to his Instagram page on Sunday to announce that he was happy to be a father again. He shared a picture of himself feeding the baby with the caption, “Blessed to experience the most amazing feeling once again. King Zayn.” See post below:  The music executive had announced the birth of a son three months ago in October 2021. It was reported that his first marriage to Kenea Udoh, Teebillz had two children and his union with Tiwa Savage produced her son, Jamil Balogun. Though the number of children by the talent manager is not certain, Teebils had last year appreciated his lover for taking care of his five children named Khalil, Gaetano, Jamil, Bisi, and Ona.
