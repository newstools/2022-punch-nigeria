His daughter, Ayinke, had confirmed the death of Kujore on Monday when she shared a picture of the music legend, with the caption, “RIP Dad”. In an official announcement by the family on Tuesday, the family revealed that Kujore died after a brief illness at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja. The statement, signed by his children, read, “The family of Wonder Adedayo Kujore, the Soko Music exponent, wishes to inform the general public officially of his death. “Dayo Kujore, died yesterday morning at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja after a brief illness.
He was 69 years old. Survived with children and many grandchildren. “The body has been deposited at a morgue while the burial arrangements will be announced later by the family.” Kujore, who was among the modern-day pioneers of the Nigerian-styled musical art form, was born on the 4th of April, 1962 in Igbore Robiyan, Abeokuta, Ogun State to parents who were clerics of the African Church. As a child, Kujore joined the choir in his local church and learnt how to play musical instruments such as the guitar, and the piano which made him fall in love with music. Travelling Juju musicians who came to his village to perform at special events spotted the young Kujore’s talent and invited him to join them during their performances, which he did. After performing with the likes of Chief Composer Jossy Olu Oguntade, MD Jaiyesinmi and Prince Adekunle, he formed a band called the Superstars with some youths, after which he formed his own band.
