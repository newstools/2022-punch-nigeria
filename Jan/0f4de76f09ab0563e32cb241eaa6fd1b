Nigeria are excited after former England youth international Ashleigh Plumptre got approval to switch her allegiance to the Super Falcons. The 23-year-old defender, who plays for Women’s Super League side Leicester City, is eligible to represent the African women’s football powerhouse because of her father’s Nigerian heritage. After joining training camps in Austria and Abuja, she has now been cleared by world football’s governing body Fifa and is eligible for Nigeria’s tricky 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations play-off against Ivory Coast in February. “We are happy to receive Ashleigh’s official clearance from FIFA,” NFF director of communications Ademola Olajire told BBC Sport Africa. “It was only possible because of her commitment and dedication. She made the federation’s work a lot easier by providing all the requirements in quick time. “Ashleigh personally approached the English FA directly to get the required international clearance from that end. “Her professionalism and unflinching desire to play for Nigeria is honestly heart-warming. That big move on her part obviously helped a lot and prevented the long wait for the FA’s response.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
