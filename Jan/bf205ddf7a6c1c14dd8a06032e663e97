Actress and filmmaker, Funke Akndele-Bello, has advised her followers never to keep up on their dreams. She stated that if they are consistent with what they do, they would eventually have a breakthrough. Taking a stroll down memory, the actress posted pictures of her taken many years ago. Looking slimmer in the photos, it was in clear contrast to how glamorous she looks these days. She added the caption, “I love throwback pictures because they remind me of where I am coming from. Thank you Lord for the journey so far. Never despise small beginnings. Stay focused because better days are ahead. Stay ‘woke’ and don’t give up.” In the video, she could be heard saying, “It’s throwback Thursday; look at me. Change is very good. Check me out here; I was very slim. See me now; money is very important. Look at how I’m glowing. Change is very constant. Just keep on doing what you’re doing. The change would meet you positively.” Unsurprisingly, the pictures generated a lot of reactions from her colleagues and fans. Actor, Ibrahim Chatta, “Very inspirational.” Gospel singer, Tope Alabi, wrote, “Wow, glory be to God.” Actor, Deyemi Okanlawon, wrote, “What God cannot do does not exist.” Adannadavid_fam wrote, “Damn mama, you are too much.” Jbeautyfull commented, “You are the funniest”; while Yetunde Bakare wrote, “You’re an inspiration.” Copyright PUNCH.
