The House of Representatives, on Wednesday, has set up an ad hoc committee to investigate funds belonging to the Federal Government being held in commercial banks. The lower chamber of the National Assembly also alleged that 71 million Nigerians were operating bank accounts without proper identification. The total amount being held by commercial banks is allegedly worth N1.2 trillion. The committee, which is headed by Hon. Unyime Idem (PDP, Akwa Ibom), would investigate the unremitted funds as well as infractions by the Central Bank of Nigeria. The resolution of the House followed the consideration of a motion presented by Dachung Bagos from Plateau State at plenary, who noted about 45.85 million bank accounts were yet to be linked since the introduction of the Bank Verification Number by the CBN in 2014.
