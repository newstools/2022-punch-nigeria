AFCON 2021 group record
Except a draw is played, Nigeria or Egypt will emerge first winners or losers in Group D of AFCON 2021. Eguavoen’s record
Nigeria is led by Augustine Eguavoen, who was on-field captain when the Eagles won the title in Tunisia in 1994, and then coached the Eagles to third place in Egypt 12 years later. In 2004, he was assistant to Coach Christian Chukwu when the Eagles picked up the bronze medals in Tunisia. Eguavoen is the only man to have coached Nigeria to win all three group phase matches at the AFCON – when they defeated Ghana, Zimbabwe, and Senegal in Port Said at the 2006 finals in Egypt. This record may be broken if Nigeria is defeated by Egypt today. Unbeaten Eagles
The Eagles qualified for their 19th AFCON appearance enjoying an unbeaten qualification where they finished at the top of Group L with 14 points ahead of Lesotho to secure smooth entry into the group stages of the tournament. They will hope to keep a clean record in the 2021 AFCON campaign. 51st win at AFCON Nigeria’s Super Eagles are targetting their 51st AFCON win in today’s game. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
