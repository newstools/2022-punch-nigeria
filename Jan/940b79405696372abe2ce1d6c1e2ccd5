The Governor of Lagos State, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said the newly purchased two sets of Red Line trains for the rail project by the administration will build the state’s economy. Sanwo-Olu disclosed this on Wednesday, in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Gboyega Akosile. The governor was quoted to have said this during his visit with the state delegation to Milwaukee, in the United States, to inspect the interior of the Talgo 330 kilometre per hour intra-city metropolitan trains. He said, “A train is not something you can just go on the shelf and pick up. We are very lucky to get brand new trains. We have seen our beautiful white and red trains. Coincidentally, the rail line is called Red Line and you can see they have given us the colour. We are just going to brand it and put up our seal there. “We hope that this purchase of the trains will be the beginning of a mutually beneficial business relationship. Providing source of livelihood for our citizens is all about providing jobs for our people and that is what we are doing. It is about ensuring that we can build our economy; people can move from one location to another and businesses can grow.” The Chief Executive Officer, Talgo USA, Antonio Perez, said “For us, it is important that our trains are utilised. It doesn’t make any good for the trains that we built to be stored and kept without passengers riding them.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
