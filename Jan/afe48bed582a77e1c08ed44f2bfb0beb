Senate President Ahmad Lawan has asserted that Nigerians will remember the Ninth National Assembly for its legislative achievements after the end of its session in 2023. This was contained in a statement by his media aide, Ezrel Tabiowo, on the occasion of Lawan’s 63rd birthday on Wednesday. The Senate President said, “Tomorrow, some of these people that are calling us all types of names will be writing very good commentaries about what we have been able to achieve in this Ninth National Assembly.” Lawan stated that the National Assembly in 2022 would focus on security through oversight of funds appropriated in this year’s budget to the armed forces and security agencies. He explained that this would guarantee transparency in the procurement process, and ensure the welfare of military and security personnel on the frontlines of restoring security volatile areas of the country. “We have appropriated about a trillion for our security agencies and armed forces, now it is for members of the National Assembly to ensure that the procurement process by the armed forces are transparent and everybody there is accountable. “[And] of course, we should do oversight as much as possible for the welfare of our soldiers and security personnel. They need to continuously be motivated,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
