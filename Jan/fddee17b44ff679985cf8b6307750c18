The Lagos State Building Control Agency has sealed over 60 buildings in the state for violating physical planning and building control laws. The Head, Public Affairs Unit, LASBCA, Mrs Adetayo Akitoye-Asagba, said this in a statement on Thursday. She said, “In a bid to rid the state of illegal and non-conforming structures, the Lagos State Building Control Agency has sealed over 60 buildings in Ikoyi, Amuwo Odofin, Iba, Eti-Osa, Ogudu and Maryland areas for contravening building control laws. “These buildings were sealed for different contraventions including failure to respond to statutory notices served, non-conformity with approved drawings and absence of certified professionals on-site amongst others. Akitoye-Asagba added that residents should visit the agency’s offices to know the status of their property under construction. “Non-response to notices served by LASBCA and the continued unlawful construction of their property in violation of the physical planning and building control laws of the state led to the enforcement exercise. “We appeal to developers, owners of property undergoing construction and residents across the state to visit any of the agency’s website or our offices located in all Local Government/Local Council Development Areas of the state for necessary information about the status of their buildings,” she said.
