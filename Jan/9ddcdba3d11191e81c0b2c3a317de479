Bishop, Ijesa North Anglican Diocese, Ijebu-Jesa, Osun State, Dr. Isaac Oluyamo, has called on the federal and state governments to listen to Nigerians and make life easy for them in the New Year. This was contained in the New Year message of the clergy obtained in Osogbo on Saturday. Oluyamo, who decried high rate insecurity in the country, however urged Nigerians to be grateful to God for seeing them through 2021. He also charged the Federal Government to ensure food sufficiency and meet other basic needs of the people to rekindle their hope in the country. The message further read, “As we usher in a New Year, it should be the beginning of a new dawn. We appeal to the police to be civil in every situation. There should be no indiscriminate arrest or treatment that threatens society. “We also appeal to the Federal Government to make life easy for us this year 2022. Governments at the federal, state and local levels should have our best interest at heart. They should listen to us and the voice of reason to make life easy in 2022. “There should be no inflation. People are hungry, provide food. People are homeless on the streets, provide shelter. People are unemployed, provide jobs.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
