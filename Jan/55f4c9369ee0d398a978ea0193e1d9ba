The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has commended the Super Eagles for an impressive start at the ongoing 33rd Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, defeating a formidable opponent, Egypt 1-0, in their group stage encounter. Buhari’s message was contained in a statement signed on Wednesday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, titled, ‘President Buhari hails Super Eagles’ inspiring start at AFCON.’ Buhari stated, “The President strongly believes, like millions of football-loving Nigerians, that the spectacular outing in Garoua, Cameroon is a foretaste of what to expect from the dedicated team as they square up against other opponents in the tournament.” He urged the Austin Eguavoen-led team and the coaching staff to remain good ambassadors on and off the field, and give loyal fans and Nigerians more exciting moments to celebrate. Buhari also assured the team of his unflinching support as they soar like an eagle to write another chapter in the annals of Nigeria’s rich football history. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
