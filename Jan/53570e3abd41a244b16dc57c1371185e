Former governor of Ekiti State, Ayo Fayose, has said the main opposition, the Peoples Democratic Party, must produce Nigeria’s next president. This is as he asserted that the Party has all it takes to win the 2023 presidential elections. Fayose said this in an interview on Politics Today, a Channels Television programme monitored by our correspondent, on Wednesday. “PDP must produce the next president in Nigeria. There is nobody that can vote for this party(APC) again. The government has lost its bearing on how to control the country. People are hungry, you are building rice pyramid. Carry the rice to the grassroot,” he said. He praised the National Chairman of the PDP, Iyorchia Ayu, whom he said had conducted himself with discipline and decorum. He said the chairman had directed all stakeholders not to come to his house to lobby for anything. When asked to speak on his relationship with the National Leader of the All Progressive Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, he said he has respect for Tinubu as a Yoruba leader, but his allegiance is to his party. He said the reason why he’s not going to contest in the 2023 presidential election is because of his determination to ensure there is unity in his party in Ekiti State. “I believe that anyone who want to rule Nigeria must first govern his state. My work is to reunite all members of the state and the party to win the governorship election, whether the person is my candidate or not. Even if former governor Segun Oni wins the primaries, I will support him,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
