No fewer than 109 more Glo subscribers on Thursday in Abuja received the different items they won in the Joy Unlimited Extravaganza promotion. According to a statement, they included a new Kia Rio winner, 32 winners of refrigerators, 38 winners of television sets and 38 power generating sets winners. The statement quoted Globacom’s State Activation Manager, Ibrahim Katsina, as saying that with the Abuja presentation over, the promotion would be rounded off with the final prize-presentation to be held in Lagos on Thursday, January 27. A real estate executive, 52-year-old Patrick Obekpa, who won the Kia Rio car in Abuja, is said to be the 14th car winner in the promo. One more car winner will emerge at the Lagos event to conclude the 15 cars Globacom promised to give out at the launch of the reward scheme in October 2021. Obekpa was quoted to have said that, “I was on my way to the office when I got the call that I had won the car. Everything since that point has been like a dream. “I have, for a few months, been saving to replace my old car which was involved in an accident. That is why this gesture from Glo is stunning.”
