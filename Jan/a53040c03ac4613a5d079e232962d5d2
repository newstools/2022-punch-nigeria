Novak Djokovic lost his bid to avoid deportation from Australia on Sunday, with a Federal Court unanimously rejecting his appeal to stay in the country and defend his Australian Open title. “The orders of the court are that the amended application be dismissed with costs”, Chief Justice James Allsop said. Meanwhile, Djokovic said Sunday he was “extremely disappointed” by a top Australian court’s decision to uphold the government’s cancellation of his visa, but he would comply and leave the country. “I respect the Court’s ruling and I will cooperate with the relevant authorities in relation to my departure from the country,” the 34-year-old world number one said in a statement on the eve of the Australian Open.
