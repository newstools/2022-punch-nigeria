The  Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has called on residents of the state to prioritise the welfare of the elderly population of the state. The governor was quoted to have made the call while inaugurating the Thani-Oladunjoye Old People Care Centre in Oke-Owode, Epe, according to a statement on Tuesday. Sanwo-Olu, who was represented by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Civic Engagement, Aderemi Adebowale, noted that the centre would go a long way in complementing the efforts of the state government in the area of social welfare development. He said, “Majority of Lagosians have refused to come to the reality that some of these elderly people have contributed immensely to the socio-economic development of the society during their prime. “The onus is on the people to care for the elderly by focusing on issues affecting them. Every individual will age and require the support of the younger generation at some point in life. “This is a bold step in re-writing our history as a people and changing the undesirable narrative of our lack of desire to adequately take care of our elderly population.” Sanwo-Olu urged individuals and organistions to partner with the state to ensure citizens’ welfare. “Those of you that are very familiar with me can attest to the fact that at every opportunity, especially at events like this, I have always canvassed that nowhere in the world can government alone meet the needs of the people or its citizens,” he said.
