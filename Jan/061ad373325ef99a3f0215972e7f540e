The Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano; a former Peoples’ Democratic Party vice-presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi; friends, and well-wishers have paid glowing tributes to the late Mrs Charity Maduka. Mrs Maduka, the wife of Coshcharis Group boss, Mr Cosmos Maduka, was buried on Friday at her hometown in Nnewi, Anambra. Obiano described her as a “selfless” and “dogged” person who led a life of service to the people and the community. The governor said her death was a great loss, not only to the family, but to the people of Anambra State and Nigeria as a whole. Obiano said Mrs Maduka would be remembered for her role in ensuring the prudent financial management and laying the foundation for the subsequent success of her family and the community. He said, “Mrs Charity Maduka played a significant part in making the husband become a role model to a generation of not just Igbo people but all Nigerians. “She was a detribalised, simple and unassuming individual who always left a memorable footprints wherever she went. Her death would be missed by the state.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
