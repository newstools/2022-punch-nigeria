Super Eagles winger, Chidera Ejuke, says he is delighted to be making his first Africa Cup of Nations appearance for Nigeria and believes the team will do their best to make the nation proud in Cameroon. The 33rd edition of the continental showpiece is billed to begin on January 9, through to February 6, with the Eagles set to begin their campaign on January 11 against Egypt, before facing Sudan on January 15 and Guinea-Bissau on January 19. The CSKA Moscow tricky winger says it’s always been a dream for him to represent Nigeria at a major tournament. “I feel happy and excited to be part of the final squad for the AFCON, it’s like a dream come true,” Ejuke said in a YouTube interview. “Growing up, we’ve been praying for opportunities like this to get to represent our country and for me being part of the team, I’m excited and looking forward to what’s going to happen.” With the withdrawal of high-profile players Victor Osimhen, Paul Onuachu, Leon Balogun and Shehu Abdullahi from the competition through injuries, Nigerians have lowered their expectations on the team. However, the 24-year-old says the team will do their best to make the nation proud in Cameroon. “The AFCON is just around the corner, we’re looking forward to what’s going to happen there. We’re not making promises but we know we’re going there as a team who is going to fight and work hard to make Nigerian proud.” Copyright PUNCH Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
