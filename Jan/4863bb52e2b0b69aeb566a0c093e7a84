Prominent Nigerian rapper, Jude Abaga, popularly known as MI, has urged tweeps to create a ‘kinder energy’ for black youths on Twitter. The One Naira crooner took to his Twitter account on Saturday to make this call. According to him, coming back into the platform after being away for a while made this realise that the social media platform was a toxic place. He then urged users of the platform to create a better energy to accommodate young black people on Twitter. “After being away from Twitter for a while, I can clearly see how toxic this place is. Wow! We need to create kinder energy for our young black people in this place,” the rapper tweeted. His statement comes days after the Federal Government decided to lift the Twitter ban in Nigeria after a 222-day suspension. The Federal Government had suspended Twitter operations in the country on June 5, 2021. However, an official statement on Wednesday revealed that the suspension has been lifted. Copyright PUNCH.
