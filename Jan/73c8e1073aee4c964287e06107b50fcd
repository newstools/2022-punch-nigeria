The Lagos State Government has said it will establish 32 agricultural projects for schools across the state through the Lagos Agricultural Scholars’ Programme. The Commissioner for Agriculture, Abisola Olusanya, said this in a statement on Thursday. Olusanya, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Mr Hakeem Adeniji, was quoted to have said this during a meeting held at the Agricultural Complex, Agege. She said, “Due to the skyrocketing cost of agricultural inputs by approximately 170 per cent, we are focusing on new enterprise under the rebranded LASP programme. In 2021, the ministry obtained the approval of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to embark on new projects for sustainability under a new nomenclature for the programme – LASP. “Consequently, we shall be establishing 32 projects in snailery, rabbitry rearing of grass cutters and goats, as well as vegetable production in more correctional centres in Lagos State and selected public secondary schools located within education districts one, two and four. These projects shall be implemented as phase one for the early part of year 2022 being a carry-over from 2021.” Olusanya added that the initiative was organised to expose students to modern agricultural skills and farming methods. “LASP is part of the ministry’s youth empowerment scheme designed to expose students to modern agricultural skills and farming methods with the aim of empowering them with sound practical knowledge of agriculture to complement the theoretical aspect being taught in the classroom and also assist schools to generate income, ensure food security and mitigate possible effects of global food crisis,” she said.
