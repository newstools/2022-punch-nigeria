The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, will on Wednesday meet with the chairmen of the 23 local government areas of the state, the Commissioner of Police and the Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps. The meeting will hold at the Government House, Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. Special Assistant to the Rivers State Governor on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, made the announcement on Tuesday. He, however, failed to state the purpose of the meeting which may not be unconnected to the issue of soot in the state caused by the activities of illegal oil refineries. Copyright PUNCH.
