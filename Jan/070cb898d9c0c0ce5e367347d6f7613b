Two persons died and two others were injured in a road crash on Tuesday in the Federal Capital Territory. The accident was said to have occurred around 9am in the Idu Forest area of the FCT. According to eyewitnesses, a truck laden with cement rammed into two tricycles and a motorcycle. The two victims were said to have died on the spot, while the injured were rushed to the Crown Hospital in Gwagwa. A resident of the area, Johnson Oye, said, “He (driver of the truck) came to supply cement to those building houses here. We can’t say if he actually lost control or was trying to overtake them; we just saw that the truck had knocked down two tricycles and a motorcycle. “The motorcyclist and his passenger suffered high degrees of injury and were taken to the Crown Hospital. “The other two that died were in one of the tricycles. The truck driver did not wait after hitting them; he was ready to crush anybody that stood in his way.” One of the survivors, who gave her name simply as Alimat, said she was on her way to get drugs for her child who was ill when the crash occurred. “I can’t really recall how it happened; we were in the front and the truck was behind us. I can’t explain what happened next. I thank God that I am alive. I had gone to buy drugs for my sick child. The rider of the motorcycle I mounted sustained serious injuries,” Alimat stated. When contacted, the Sector Commander, FCT Command, Federal Road Safety Corps, Samuel Ochi, said he was not aware of the accident. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
