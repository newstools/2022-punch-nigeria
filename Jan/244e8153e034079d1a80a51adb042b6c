Remains of Timothy Adegoke, whose death occurred at Hilton Hotel, Ile-Ife, in November 2021 left the morgue of Osun State University Teaching Hospital, Osogbo. The corpse was received by the late Adegoke’s brother, Gbade, some clerics and a few other relatives of the deceased around 12:45 on Friday for the homeward journey to Eruwa, his hometown. Before the corpse was moved into a waiting ambulance, some operatives of Osun Police Command, said to have come around to sign necessary documents before the deceased would be released, were sighted in the premises of the hospital. Counsel to the deceased’s family, Naim Adekilekun, in a chat with our correspondent on the hospital premises, insisted that the trial of the suspects arrested in connection with the death should be moved back to Osun State. “We want the trial of the suspects to be done here in Osun. We hope justice will be done in this matter,” Adekilekun said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
