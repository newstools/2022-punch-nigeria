The Oshoja ruling house in Ikeja, Lagos, has appealed to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to intervene in the kingship crisis in the community. A statement by the head of the ruling house, Mr Issa Akinlabi, appealed to Sanwo-Olu to declare Mr Wasiu Owolabi as the next king of Ikeja. It added that kingmakers had accepted to have Owolabi occupy the stool of Olu of Ikeja after going through rigorous screenings. The statement reads, “It will be recalled that for the past seven years the stool of Ikeja has remained vacant after the demise of the former king, Oba Raufu Amori, who died on July 1, 2014. “We appeal to Sanwo-Olu to urgently wade into the issue as a matter of urgency. The capital city of Lagos State has been without a king for the past seven years. We would appreciate your support as the executive governor of Lagos State to approve and install Owolabi as appropriate. “In May 12, 2014, the kingmakers comprise of Akogun, Ekerin and Balogun of Ikeja forwarded the name of the Oba-elect, Mr Wasiu Owolabi, to the Ikeja Local Government Area and the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs after rigorous screening.” Meanwhile, the ruling house had renounced one Tajudeen Muritala, whom the statement said is allegedly parading himself on social media as the newly elected king of Ikeja. Owolabi also said, “After rigorous screening, I emerged as the most deserving royal son and my name was forwarded to the Lagos State Government for screening which was later forwarded to the Ministry of Justice; I was issued clearance as the newly elected Olu of Ikeja on August 10, 2016.”  Copyright PUNCH.
