In compliance with the directive of the Kwara State Government, beggars have vacated areas prohibited for street begging in the Ilorin metropolis in the state capital. PUNCH Metro findings showed that beggars have vacated such areas as Tanke-University of Ilorin Road and Gerin-Alimi-Airport Road. Recall that a team from Kwara Environmental Protection Agency had last Friday evacuated the recalcitrant beggars from the Gerin-Alimi-Airport Road, with a stern warning to them not to return to the spots. The agency warned that any beggar who failed to comply with the directive of the state government will henceforth face prosecution. As part of efforts to ensure strict compliance with the government’s order by the beggars, the Commissioner for Social Development, Hon. Abosede Aremu, on Tuesday, led a team to some of the prohibited areas to assess the level of compliance. After the assessment tour, the commissioner expressed satisfaction with the level of compliance by the beggars. She praised the leaders of the Hausa community for their cooperation and for speaking with the leaders of the beggars on the need for the beggars to vacate the prohibited areas within the Ilorin metropolis. The representatives of the Hausa community, Surajudeen Hussaini, Rufai Sanni, and Mohammed Lawal, pledged their continued support for the government in ensuring that the beggars stay off the prohibited areas.
