Publisher and newspaper columnist, Dele Momodu, has officially informed the Peoples Democratic Party of his intention to contest the presidential ticket of the party. Momodu disclosed this on Thursday afternoon at the PDP National Secretariat in Abuja where he formally presented his letter of intent to the National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu. According to Momodu, the move became necessary because he cannot run for the presidency without the nomination of his party. Receiving the publisher at his office, Ayu affirmed that the PDP will offer a level-playing field for all aspirants. The Chairman expressed hope that Momodu is bringing his political and media experience to the party and advised him to seek party members’ support. Ayu also assured him of the PDP’s support if he emerges as its candidate, saying that all other aspirants will rally round whoever becomes the flagbearer. Details shortly… Copyright PUNCH.
