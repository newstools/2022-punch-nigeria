Instagram comedian, Isaac Aloma, aka Zicsaloma, says he is not moved by the criticisms he gets for acting like a woman. Speaking in an interview with Sunday Scoop, he said, “Everyone can’t like what one does. People criticise for different reasons; most of which do not matter to me. I am making my fans happy and it pays my bills; that is what matters. What I do made me who I am today. I have met great people I only dreamt of meeting because of what I do.” Asked to list the high points of 2021 for him, Aloma said, “I had several high points but some of them were working with many A-list celebrities such as Don Jazzy, Mercy Johnson, Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde, Toyin Abraham and Yvonne Nelson.” Speaking on the issue of rivalry among skit makers, he said, “I would not say there is no rivalry but it is almost not noticeable. The unity between Nigerian comedians cannot be overemphasised as it is seen in the constant collaborations and support we give ourselves.” On why he is planning a show in the United Kingdom, Zicsaloma said, “I have been able to meet a lot of my fans at different shows or events in Lagos and it has been overwhelming how I constantly get social media messages from my fans in the UK fans, expressing their wish to meet me. That was why I decided to have a show in the UK.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
