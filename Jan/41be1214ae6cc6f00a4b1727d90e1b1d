The Enugu Electricity Distribution Company has said it is set to embark on an intensive revenue drive across its franchise area. The EEDC said in a statement that the exercise would effectively commence on January 25 (today) through January 29. The statement signed by its Head of Corporate Communications, Mr Emeka Ezeh, on Monday, said the revenue drive was to enable the company to cover up for the lost days experienced in January, which was occasioned by the imposed sit-at-home order and insecurity situation in the South-East geopolitical zone. It said the exercise would entail visits by officials of the company to its customers for payment of their energy bills and disconnection of those that were indebted. It said, “This move became necessary to enable EEDC to effectively sustain its operations and provide quality services to its customers. In addition, it will enable the company to pay for the energy it imported and meet up with its obligations to the market operators and other stakeholders. “EEDC, therefore, appeals to its esteemed customers to cooperate with the officials that will be visiting their premises during the period of the revenue drive. It is pertinent to note that the power sector cannot effectively operate if energy bills are not paid by customers. “To avoid being disconnected, customers are advised to visit the EEDC cash offices nearest to them or any of the collection agents within their locality, to pay their bills. Payments can also be made through various online channels. EEDC assured its customers of its commitment to delivering quality service to them, and count on their support during this revenue drive exercise.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
