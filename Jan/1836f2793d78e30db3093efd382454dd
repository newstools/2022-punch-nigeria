The Lagos Eminent Lions Club, District 404B-2 Nigeria, has unveiled its water system project which was donated to Unity High School, Oshodi. The club’s District Governor, Mr Kayode Oshinuga, on Wednesday, inaugurated the borehole, three water tanks and 16 taps within the school premises in Oshodi. He said, “For any service project we want to undertake, we are encouraged to find out from the community what they need, and in this case, we undertook a community need assessment and the school made a request that this was what they need. “In our tradition, we say, ‘when there is a need, there is a lion.’ This water project is the first phase of our project in the school and it is our investment in the social welfare of students.” The former Principal, Unity School, Oshodi, Mrs Adenike Faronbi, said, “The Lagos State Government has done so much for us, but with the support of your club to provide water, which is a basic necessity, we are mindful of the crucial role you have played, because, with this, the risk of the students being exposed to water-borne diseases is reduced.” The President, LELC, Mr Ekundayo Kolawole, said, “Unity school has also requested for the upgrading and equipping of their library and this will be the second phase of our project to contribute to learning.” Copyright PUNCH.
