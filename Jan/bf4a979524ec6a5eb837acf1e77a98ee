Super Eagles defender William Troost-Ekong says he relishes his partnership with teammate Kenneth Omeruo. Troost-Ekong, a former U-19 and U-20 Holland international, made his debut for the Eagles in 2015, two years after Omeruo had won the AFCON title in 2013. The 28-year-old, who currently partners Omeruo in central defence at the ongoing tournament in Cameroon, said the Leganes defender had been awesome in the heart of the Eagles defence. “I think he’s (Omeruo) been great,” Troost-Ekong said. “He is a fantastic player. He was a player I was looking up to before I joined the Eagles; he had won the AFCON at that time. I’ve enjoyed playing together with him. “At the last World Cup in Russia, we played games together as a back three and at the last AFCON in Egypt we played most of the games together so in that sense there are no surprises. “We have some fantastic players like (Chidozie) Awaziem and Leon Balogun, who is not here, obviously. “I enjoy playing with Kenneth. I think he’s a fantastic defender and he makes it easy. We have a lot of options defensively and it’s keeping us all sharp to perform to our best.” On playing under five different coaches, the Watford defender said he tries to adjust to their playing styles amid the difficulty. “Each coach brings their own style and most important thing as a player is to try and execute their plans,” he continued. “Each time a new coach comes in, there is a change of direction and we adapt to it because we are working towards the same goal. “The main thing is that the players buy into it and are enjoying their football again.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
