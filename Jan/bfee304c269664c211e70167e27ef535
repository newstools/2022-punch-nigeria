The Super Eagles players are still being owed two-match allowances by the Nigeria Football Federation ahead of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The Eagles, who are expected to arrive in Garuoa on Wednesday, are drawn in Group D with seven-time winners Egypt, Guinea- Bissau and Sudan. Speaking in a press conference on Tuesday in Abuja, captain Ahmed Musa stated that the team would hold a meeting when the entire squad was complete, ahead of the tournament. “We are owed two games allowances by the NFF and we will be having a meeting when every player is in camp,” the Fatih Karagumruk forward said. “The coaches, officials of the NFF and representatives of the players will meet to discuss, so we can stick with a plan.” The 28-year-old, a member of the 2013 squad that won the AFCON title for the third time in South Africa, added that the Eagles won’t be in Cameroon for sightseeing, despite their late preparations for the tournament. The former Leicester City winger joined up with the squad on Monday, with the team having just three full training sessions since last week. “We have been together for a while now and we are ready for this tournament,” Musa added.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
