The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, has expressed optimism that his ongoing trial by the Federal Government for alleged terrorism would only “last for a while.” He also told his followers to embrace  peace  and not be distracted. Kanu’s lawyer and human rights activist, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, said these in a statement issued on Friday titled, ‘Update on our routine visit to our indefatigable client, Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu at the headquarters of the Department of State Services, Abuja, being January 28 2022.” He said, “Our visit to our indefatigable client – Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, remains positive as our legal strategies were discussed, and he is in firm spirit. “Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu deeply appeals to Umu Chineke to avail themselves of the peace initiative presently ongoing and not to be distracted anymore. He further implored all Umu Chineke to keep their eyes on the ball because enemies are struggling in vain to entrench disharmony. “Onyendu reiterates that the ongoing interventions towards peaceful coexistence must be respected, encouraged and abided by. His call for unity among the entire Umu Chineke at all levels, who believe in his peaceful message cannot be overemphasised. “Further, Onyendu extends his warm regards to millions of his fans and followers who have equally remained consistently resolute and focused. He is convinced that the present situation will only last a while and he will emerge victoriously.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
