Ogun State Government said it will not allow terrorists, killer herdsmen, kidnappers or bandits to turn forests to a hiding place after unleashing mayhem on the people. The state government said it was collaborating with Oyo and Lagos states to dislodge terrorists from forests across the state. The government expressed worry on the persistent clash between farmers and herders, insisting that security of the state was being threatened by armed herders from the northern part of the country and local outlaws. Commander of Amotekun Corps in the state, David Akinremi, said these in a statement made available to newsmen on Friday. Recently, eight villages in the Imeko-Afon Local Government Area of the state were recently attacked by murderous herders as well as the violent exchange between herdsmen and some Ohori farmers at Idofa village, which left five persons dead and property worth millions of naira destroyed. Akinremi, a retired police commissioner, said Amotekun personnel had also collaborated with the Army, Police, Department of State Services, Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps among others to rid the state of criminals. He said “We won’t allow killer herdsmen and kidnappers in our forests. The state government has concluded arrangements to fortify all the 20 local government areas of the state with Amotekun operatives.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
