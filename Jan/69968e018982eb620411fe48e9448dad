Travellers whose boat was hijacked by suspected pirates over a week ago in the Calabar, Cross River State channel, have yet to regain their freedom. PUNCH Metro gathered that out of the 17 victims, only five had been set free. The boat travellers were on their way from the Safe Journey beach in Calabar to Oron beach in Akwa Ibom State on January 17, 2022, when the pirates struck. The state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Irene Ugbo, confirmed on Wednesday that the remaining victims were still being held. She said, “The victims are still with the abductors.” Our correspondent learnt that among those still being held were a professor from the University of Calabar and a naval officer. The pirates reportedly threatened to kill the victims if their families failed to pay a ransom of N36m. It was gathered that among those freed a week ago were a pregnant woman, an injured four-year-old child, an elderly woman and the boat driver.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
