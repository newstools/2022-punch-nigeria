The people Ukwa East and West Local Government Area of Abia State have passed a vote of no confidence on the member representing Ukwa East/West Federal constituency in the House of Representatives, Uzoma Abonta. Speaking under the umbrella of Coalition of Ukwa Leadership Accountability, the constituents asked Abonta to resign within 24 hours or face recall from the House of Representatives. COFULA, in a petition to the Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission Prof Mahmood Yakubu, read by its spokesperson, Ukaegbu Chinenye, stated that the over 15 years of Abonta’s representation of the constituency was colossal waste. They alleged that Abonta failed, neglected and refused to use his office to attract commensurate projects to the constituency. The petition dated January 17, 2022 read in part, “We have the worst road in Nigeria, no light, water and good hospital, despite being an oil-producing federal constituency. “Throughout the period, Abonta never deemed it fit to call for a constituency meeting, he represented only his interest and pocket. “The self-serving representative gradually blossomed into despot and talks down on us. Instead of protecting and representing the constituency, being his primary responsibility, he makes mockery of us with impunity.” The group, also in a three-point communiqué after its meeting on Monday, made available to our correspondent pointed out that the collection of signatures for Abonta’s recall in had already commenced.
