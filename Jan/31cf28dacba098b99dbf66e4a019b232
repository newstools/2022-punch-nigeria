The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) has expressed sadness over the death of 19 passengers who met their tragic fate on Thursday in a road accident that occurred on the Kano-Zaria Road. Buhari’s message is contained in a statement signed on Friday by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, titled ‘President Buhari expresses sadness over the death of 19 passengers in Kano road accident’. Reacting to the incident, the President said, “I’m devastated and saddened by this unfortunate tragedy that claimed the lives of passengers who happily left their homes without any idea that it was going to be their last day on earth. “The frequency of road accidents is particularly worrisome and it calls for greater reflection on the importance of safety standards. “I understand that the accident was blamed on over-speeding and this account worries me deeply.” Buhari, who cautioned drivers to take safety regulations seriously, said they have the responsibility to protect their passengers. “It’s unfortunate that ours is a country where, despite regular public enlightenment programmes by road safety officials, our recalcitrant drivers treat the issue with indifference. “Adherence to safety standards and regulations can go a long way to protect lives,” he said. The President, thereafter, extended his condolences to the Government of Kano State and the families of those who died in the accident. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
