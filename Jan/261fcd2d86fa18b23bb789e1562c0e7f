Nollywood actress, Annie Idibia, has told her critics not to abuse the privileges she had given to them. She made this known on her Instagram story on Saturday, where she ranted about people who are courteous to her but do the opposite behind her back. In an earlier post, she had noted that entitlement was the biggest sin. She wrote, “Don’t call me Ma, Mama or Madam in front of me, then behind me, you refer to me as “Annie” or she! “Do not abuse the privileges you were given! Nobody owes you anything! No one owes me anything either! “Even if it s a smile, hug, water or one naria, do not be unfortunate or ungrateful to ever utter words like, what has she/he done for me?’ “It clearly says/shows how ungrateful and entitled you are.” The mother-of-two also advised her fans to be mindful of how much access they give to people. She warned that when people get too comfortable, they may become disrespectful and “totally carried away.” “Be Mindful of how much access you give. Be careful of how much information you give when you are vulnerable,” the actress said. She added, “Be careful of how much you open up. People will get too ‘comfortable’ and then become disrespectful. “They’d get totally carried away and totally forget their place! Don’t share too much of yourself freely; your pain, hurt, and even ur joy.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
