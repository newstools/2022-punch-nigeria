There was palpable fear among some residents of Osogbo, following the movement of about 1,000 cattle led by some herdsmen into the Osun State capital, under the cover of night. Residents of Omobolanle area of Osogbo, who sighted the large number of cattle late on Wednesday, had reportedly alerted men of Amotekun Corps that a herd of cattle and herdsmen were approaching the town. Responding to the distress call, men of Amotekun Corps, led by the Field Commander, Amitolu Shittu, it was learnt, stopped the herders and interrogated them. In a chat with our correspondent on Thursday, Shittu, who confirmed the incident, said the herders were not armed, but added that their presence led to panic among residents. He said, “It is true that some herders coming from Ogbomoso had entered Osogbo under the cover of the night. They were 12 herdsmen leading about 1,000 cattle. “They didn’t want to cooperate initially, but after we stopped them, they said they were looking for water. They also told us they had checked round the town during the day to identify routes they wanted to take. “We informed them that Osun has outlawed open grazing. We then led them to a river. After their cattle had taken water, we marched them to a border between Osun and a neighbouring state. Their presence led to panic but we quickly arrested the situation.” Copyright PUNCH.
