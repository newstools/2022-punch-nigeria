Athletic Bilbao came back from a goal down to defeat La Liga champions Atletico Madrid 2-1 on Thursday and set up a Spanish Super Cup final against Real Madrid. The Basque outfit trailed just after the hour mark when a header from Joao Felix crashed off the post before being deflected into the goal via the back of Unai Simon. However, the match swung Bilbao’s way inside four minutes late in the second half. A 77th-minute header from Yeray Alvarez levelled the scores before Nico Williams hit the winner nine minutes from time. Real Madrid made sure of their place in Sunday’s final with a 3-2 win over Barcelona on Wednesday. AFP
