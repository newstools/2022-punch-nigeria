Troops have rescued eight kidnap victims in the Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State. The state Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, who disclosed this on Tuesday, also said three terrorists were killed by troops in separate operations in the Chikun, Igabi and Giwa local government areas of the state. Aruwan, who did not give details of when the operations took place, said the state government was furnished with the information by military authorities. The commissioner said, “According to the first operational feedback, troops in the Maraban Rido general area of Chikun LGA responded to sounds of gunfire and swiftly mobilised towards the target location in Ungwan Musa. The troops fought their way through an ambush, which they cleared aggressively as they approached the scene of the attack. “An intense fire fight followed at the targeted building. The troops’ superior firepower eventually prevailed over the terrorists, who escaped through a back fence with gunshot wounds as confirmed by bloodstains, which lined their exit. “The troops pursued the terrorists through their withdrawal route and in the process rescued eight persons, who had initially been taken hostage. “One of the outlaws was neutralised by the troops during the operation. “Similarly, an attack at Unguwar Tasha in the Birnin Yero general area of the Igabi LGA was successfully foiled by security forces when terrorists tried to force their way into residential buildings in the area. One of the bandits was neutralised in this operation. “Also, a terrorists’ attack was foiled in Hayin Kanwa, Giwa LGA. One of the terrorists was similarly neutralised during the encounter.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
