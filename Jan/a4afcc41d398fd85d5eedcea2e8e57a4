Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, says the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), will offer guidance on the parts of the country the All Progressives Congress should zone its chairmanship and 2023 presidential tickets to. The governor stated this after a visit to the President at the State House in Abuja on Friday. Abiodun spoke ahead of the APC National Convention in February and general elections next year. He said, “I am not in any position to advise the party. I am a governor, I am a member of the party, and I will continue to be guided by the party leadership and in line with the party’s discipline. “We have a President in place, our President is the leadership of the party, I believe that His Excellency Mr President will continue to offer us the guidance that is required and we will do that which we need to do under his leadership. “We are aware that the party is working on zoning and when that is formalised and ratified by NEC (National Executive Committee), then it will be made public, then we will know where the chairman of the party will come from, we will know where the President will come from and things will evolve in their own time.” Abiodun was accompanied on the visit by a delegation including former governor of the state, Olusegun Osoba; Chairman of the Council of Obas, Oba Babatunde Ajayi; former deputy governor, Salimot Badru and a foremost industrialist, Sulaiman Adegunwa. The governor said he was at Aso Villa to thank Buhari for his recent visit to Ogun State where he inaugurated about five projects. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
