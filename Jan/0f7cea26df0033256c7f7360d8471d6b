The Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, has said he will declare his intention to contest in the 2023 presidential election after the national convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress. This is as he revealed that youths and women including Nigerians abroad are urging him to run for president and build on the achievement of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). Bello said this while addressing journalists in Lokoja, the Kogi State capital. “We are looking forward to the convention of our great party and by the grace of God, I will declare. But we must have a platform to run on and that is the All Progressives Congress. The party has been built solidly under the leadership of Governor Mai Mala Buni. They have done a great job, we shall conclude the rest in our convention. “By the mandate and calling of Nigerians, Nigerian youths and women and people all over the world that are calling me to run and build on the achievement of President Muhammadu Buhari. I will surely answer them immediately after our convention as the case may be,” Bello said as quoted by Channels Television. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
