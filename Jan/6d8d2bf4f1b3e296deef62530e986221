Brentford’s Premier League clash with Wolves on Saturday was delayed for 20 minutes during the first half after a drone flew above the stadium. The drone appeared above Brentford’s Community Stadium in west London, close to Heathrow Airport, with 31 minutes played and the score tied at 0-0. Referee Peter Bankes and fourth official Martin Atkinson ordered the players off the field in accordance with Premier League rules, with the stadium announcer confirming play had been stopped due to an “unofficial drone”. Both sets of players looked baffled with Wolves captain Conor Coady asking Bankes: “What is going on?” The teams eventually re-emerged at 1550 GMT and had a brief warm-up before play restarted, with 19 minutes of the first half still remaining. There had already been a six-minute delay after a clash of heads between Brentford team-mates Mathias Jensen and Rico Henry, which left both bleeding heavily. Half-time eventually arrived 71 minutes after the match originally kicked off. AFP
