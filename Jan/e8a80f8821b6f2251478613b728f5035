The Nasarawa State Police Command has arrested a 43-year-old man, Mr Dan’asabe Eddo, for allegedly raping an 80-year-old woman in the state. The state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Ramhan Nansel, disclosed this in a statement in Lafia on Sunday. According to the statement, the suspect went to the house of the octogenarian, who lived alone, and raped her. The statement read, “One Dan’asabe Eddo, a 43-year-old man of Kubasha village, Kagarko LGA, Kaduna, but resident in Kundami village, Garaku, Kokona LGA of Nasarawa State, nocturnally went into the residence of an 80-year-old woman, who stays alone in the same village, and forcefully had carnal knowledge of her. “Upon receipt of the complaint, police operatives attached to the Garaku division immediately swung into action and got the suspect arrested. “Upon interrogation, the suspect admitted to the commission of the offence and blamed it on the handiwork of the devil.” Nansel said the state Commissioner of Police, Adesina Soyemi, had directed that the case be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Lafia, for further investigations. The police spokesman urged members of the public to protect the elderly to guard against a recurrence of such incidents. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
