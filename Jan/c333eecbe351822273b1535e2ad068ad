Former Super Eagles midfielder, John Ogu, has revealed that there are so many things that go on behind the scene when footballers fail to show up for national assignments. Watford forward, Emmanuel Dennis, has been in the news after his club refused to grant him permission to feature for the Eagles at the AFCON as club coach Claudio Ranieri revealed that the invitation for the in-form player came late. There have been controversies following the player’s inability to honour the call-up with Eagles interim coach, Augustine Eguavoen, has blamed Watford for stopping the player, “Dennis told me he wanted to come for the tournament but Watford threatened him from coming.” Ogu in a series of tweets revealed how a manager in Portugal told him to lie to Nigerian handlers he was injured and won’t be available for selection for a friendly. “I’m not even surprised at the situation of foreign managers or clubs not wanting their players to go represent their country in tournaments. One certain manager in Portugal asked that I told the Eagles coach then that I was injured so as not to go for a friendly game. “The disrespect to Africans and its football tournaments. They don’t rate any of them at all. We have seen so many tournaments FIFA and UEFA have already introduced in world football but when it comes to Africa and Africans, it’s always a different case.” Football fans in Nigeria have slammed Dennis on social media for choosing to play for Watford instead of attending the AFCON with Eagles who will be missing key players such as Victor Osimhen, Paul Onuachu, Leon Balogun and Shehu Abdullahi.
