The vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2019 election, Peter Obi, has said Nigeria must prioritise security in 2022 for the country to move forward. This he says will boost investments in the country, stressing that without security, people will not think of other meaningful things to do. Obi said this while fielding questions from journalists at the Sam Mbakwe International Airport, Owerri, the Imo State capital, on Monday. He said, “Security of lives and property must be a priority for the country to move forward. “With security, investments will flow into the country and citizens will also have the confidence to invest in the country. “Until the people are secured, they will not think of other meaningful things to do.” With the 2023 general elections fast approaching, the former governor of Anambra State advised Nigerians to choose leaders with good character. “I am talking of leaders with verifiable antecedents and whose character and disposition are beyond reproach,” he said. Reacting to an interview on Arise TV during which the Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-rufai, spoke about the need to restore security and ensure that competent persons were elected, Obi expressed his agreement with the governor. He said, “It was truthful of El-Rufai to have admitted that if security was guaranteed, that Kaduna State would have done better than she is presently doing. “He did also mention that Nigeria is in a critical junction that needs good leadership to salvage her.” Copyright PUNCH.
