The Katsina State Police Command has said its operatives repelled a terrorist attack on Badole village, in the Kurfi Local Government Area of the state. The spokesman for the command, SP Gambo Isah, in a statement on Monday, said the terrorists swooped on the village early Saturday and rustled an unspecified number of domestic animals. He revealed that operatives of the command and members of the vigilantes in the council, who were alerted to the incident, mobilised and blocked the exit routes of the terrorists at Yarrunfar Koza village. According to him, the development led to a gun duel between the security team and the terrorists. “The team engaged the terrorists in a gun duel; many were neutralised and all the rustled animals were recovered,” the statement added.
