THE Imo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has described as disastrous, the two years reign of Hope Uzodinma as the governor of the state. The PDP, in a statement issued by its state Publicity Secretary, Emenike Nmeregini, on Monday, assessing the second anniversary of the governor, accused him of underperforming. The main opposition party said that within two years, the Uzodinma’s administration had politicised insecurity in the state and allowed bandits, kidnappers and terrorists to overrun the state. It also alleged that the state is now the unemployment capital of the country, owing to bad governance. According to the PDP, the state is now the most indebted in the South-East zone, owing to what it called huge borrowing without proper utilization of the funds by the Uzodinma administration. “Last year alone, the regime accessed over N59 billion loans from foreign and domestic sources. This year, 2022, Senator Uzodinma has perfected plans to borrow an additional N61bn. “When added to well over N103bn which has come to the local government areas from FAAC (Federal Accounts Allocation Committee) under Uzodinma, the N105bn which has come to the state, the N24bn which the state has internally generated and the N10bn which represents the 13 per cent oil derivation; it is heartbreaking that there is nothing in Imo to show for the monies,” the party lamented. When contacted for reaction, the state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, simply dismissed the PDP’s claims. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
