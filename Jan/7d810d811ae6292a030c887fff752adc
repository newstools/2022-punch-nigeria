The Lagos State Blood Transfusion Service has embarked on awareness to sensitise residents to the benefits of voluntary blood donation. The Executive Secretary, LSBTS, Dr Bodunrin Osikomaiya, said this in a statement on Wednesday, adding that donors could visit any of the agency’s voluntary blood donation centres or licensed blood banks. She said, “The LSBTS is joining many parts of the world to raise the awareness for voluntary blood donation by tagging January as its Blood Donor Awareness month because there is usually a period of blood shortage caused by reduction in blood donations and blood donation drives or cancellations by walk-in donors during the yuletide season and holidays. “Since the commencement of the awareness program, our team has visited churches, mosques, Kanu Ndubuisi Park, city malls, Alausa secretariat, Oshodi Bus Rapid Transit Park, among others, to sensitise residents to the need for blood, benefits of blood donation and where blood can be donated voluntarily.” Osikomaiya added that the campaign will boost the availability of blood for those who need it. “We are optimistic that with this awareness campaign more individuals will be recruited as voluntary blood donors and organisations would include voluntary blood donation activities as a corporate social responsibility, and these will increase the availability of blood for all those who require it,” she said.
