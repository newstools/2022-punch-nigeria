Alex Lacazette’s finish at the end of a flowing team move against Southampton has been named as the Premier League Goal of the Month for December. The move started from the back with Aaron Ramsdale and involved clever link-up between Martin Odegaard, Takehiro Tomiyasu and Bukayo Saka. Our winger then picked out our French striker in space, who fired emphatically into the top corner from the edge of the box.

“It was perfect movement from the back,” Laca said. “From Aaron then we went through on the right side with one-touch [football] and then the cross from Bukayo and I could score. “It was really good, because we work this every week, this is the type of goal every team would like to score. Everyone was involved and it was really satisfying. “It would go in my top five [of my favourite goals] because it was really a team goal and I believe that football is all about the team, so these types of goal are really amazing for me.” Lacazette’s strike beat the likes of Kevin De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva and Mason Mount to the prize.
