Guinea-Bissau has been handed a big boost ahead of their final Group D game against Nigeria at the Roumde Adjia Stadium, Garoua on Wednesday, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The Djurtus welcome back five players for the fixture after they tested negative for COVID-19 in Garuoa. The players are Nanu, Alfa Semedo, Mimito Biai, Maurice Gomis and Joseph Mendes. The quintet tested positive for COVID-19 last Friday but have since been cleared by officials, media officer of the Guinea-Bissau team Edgar Pires told PUNCH Sports Extra. “The players trained with the team, which is a big boost but they will have to undergo another test again before the game,” Pires said. PUNCH Sports Extra had reported on Monday that their coach Baciro Cande, who missed the game against Egypt due to COVID-19, will return to the bench for the game after he also tested negative. In his absence, Cande’s assistant Emiliano Te was in charge of the team in their 1-0 loss to Egypt. Guinea Bissau are currently third in the group with a point from their opening two games but they need to avoid defeat against the Eagles and hope Sudan fail to get a win in their final fixture against second-place Egypt. Nigeria currently lead the group with six points having defeated Egypt and Sudan 1-0 and 3-1 respectively, while seven-time champions, the Pharaohs, are second with three points. Sudan are bottom with just one point with an inferior goal difference of -2 to Guinea Bissau, who have -1. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
