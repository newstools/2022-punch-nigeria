Several empty creates and bottles were destroyed in a fire incident that occurred at the create depot of the International Breweries, Ilesha, Osun State, on Friday. The spokesman for the Osun State Fire Service, Ibrahim Adekunle, said in an interview with our correspondent that as of Saturday morning, firemen had yet to completely extinguish the inferno. Adekunle, who said the prompt response to a distress call by the firemen prevented the spread of the inferno to other places, added that no life was lost in the incident. According to him, comprehensive investigation into the cause of the incident has not been done. He, however, said bush burning around the location of the brewery probably triggered by cigarette butts was strongly suspected. He stated, “From our records, the fire started around 6pm on Friday and men of the Osun State Fire Service and those of the Federal Fire Service were immediately deployed to the scene. “The place affected is the create depot, where empty creates or creates with empty bottles were kept. As of this morning (Saturday), we have yet to completely subdue the fire due to the nature of the items kept there. But we have restricted it to a place. It can’t spread again. “We have not done a comprehensive investigation yet, but we strongly suspect bush burning, maybe triggered by cigarette butts. “However, we have been able to restrict it to a place. It can’t spread again. We can’t estimate the loss yet, because we have not collected the details of what was kept in the depot from the management. No casualty was recorded either.”  Copyright PUNCH.
