The Lagos State Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources, Mr Olalere Odusote, has said the state will continue to leverage on gas potential. Odusote said this at the groundbreaking of Autogas Conversion Centre in Lagos by Portland Gas Limited and TDHL International Logistics Limited. He said, “There is no gainsaying that Nigeria has not leveraged its gas potential. We rank low in Sub-saharan Africa in per capita consumption of LPG with an estimated consumption of 1kg per capita. When we compare that with 3kg per capita in Ghana, 5.5kg per capita in South Africa and 44 kg per capita in Morocco, we still have a long way to go. “Lagos plays a pivotal role in the Nigerian economy and remains the focal point of the country’s economic activities. We are fully committed to collaborating with the Federal Government through the Ministry of Petroleum Resources to transition Lagos State to a gas power economy by promoting increased utilisation of natural gas in the state. “In place of this gas, Nigeria still primarily depends on dirtier fuels which result in poor air quality.” The Director-General of the National Automotive Design and Development Council, Mr Aliyu Jelani, said vehicles converted or produced to run on autogas produce fewer amounts of harmful emissions associated with traditional fuels.
