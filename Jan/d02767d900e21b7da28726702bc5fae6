The Taraba State government has earmarked N4.7bn for pensions and gratuities in the 2022 budget to address the plight of retired civil servants in the state. The government budgeted N83.2m for Taraba State Library Board. The Commissioner for Budget and Planning, Mr Solomon Elisha, disclosed these at a briefing in Jalingo on Monday. In the budget as signed into law by the Governor, the Office of the Accountant General got the lion’s share of N16.1bn for debt servicing and consultancy, followed by the Office of the Governor N11.3bn, while Taraba State Sports Council got the least allocation of N31m. Commenting on the budget, an economist, Mr Terna Phillips, told our correspondent that the state needed to invest more in infrastructural projects like roads, water, health care, agriculture and mineral subsectors to boost the economy. He said, “Taraba is a poor state that needs not be poor, giving the huge potential available in the state. The state has a good climate for the production of virtually every crop. “Good investment in road construction, agriculture, social justice that would see sustainable peace return to the state, among others, can transform the state into an investor destination.” Copyright PUNCH.
