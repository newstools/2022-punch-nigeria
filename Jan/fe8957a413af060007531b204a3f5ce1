Super Eagles captain Ahmed Musa donated the sum of $1,500 to a mosque in Garoua on Friday after Jumat service, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The mosque, which is located close to the Eagles camp, (Hotel Le Ribadu) in Garoua, is where the Muslim players in the team pray daily since their arrival in the northern part of Cameroon on January 5. The gesture is expected to help the clerics complete the building, which is still under construction. According to a team official, Musa, who has made one substitute appearance at the tournament, has always had it in mind to support the building of the mosque since he first prayed there. “It’s just his little way of saying thank you to them,” the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. Musa will be aiming to make his second appearance at the tournament against Tunisia in a Round of 16 clash at the Roumde Adjia Stadium in Garoua on Sunday. The 28-year-old winger is the most capped player in the history of Nigerian football with 104 appearances for the Eagles since his debut in 2011 against Guinea in Conakry.  Copyright PUNCH.
