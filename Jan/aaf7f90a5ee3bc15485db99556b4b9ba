Nigerian airline, Arik Air, has released a statement rubbishing claims that one of its aircraft crashlanded due to a technical fault on Wednesday Nigerian Actress, Uche Elendu, had taken to her Instagram page on Wednesday to narrate the incident which saw herself and other passengers returning to Lagos after the faulty plane had to make a U-turn. “My flight, Arik Air from Lagos to Asaba just crashlanded in a remote area. We were 10 minutes to Asaba but the gear failed and the pilot had to reverse to Lagos. I’m on a 20 minutes bus ride to the terminal now, not a word of apology from the crew,” she alleged. Contradicting Elendu’s claims, the airline in a statement released via their official Instagram page on Wednesday, stated that the said airplane landed safely at the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos. “One of our dash 8 Q-400 aircraft operating the Lagos-Asaba flight this evening made an air return to base due to a technical issue. “The aircraft landed safely, and the Pilot in Command, in compliance with safety procedures, decided to disembark the passengers on the airside of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport. The aircraft was later taxied to the Arik Air hanger for maintenence action,” the statement read. Apologising for the inconvenience, the airline claimed it provided a substitute aircraft for the affected passengers. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
