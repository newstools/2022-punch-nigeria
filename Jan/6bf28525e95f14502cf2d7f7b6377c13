The Ogwaniocha community in Ogbaru Local Government Area of Anambra State has petitioned the state governor, Willie Obiano, over frequent attacks, killings and destructions in the community. In the petition signed by the President General of the community, Mr Christopher Obituhe; and the Secretary, Mr. Chidi Eze, they said the “satanic and barbaric acts” had thrown the community into chaos. They said the ongoing crisis in the community had forced the people to take refuge in various Internally Displaced Persons’ camps. They, therefore, called on the governor to intervene to alleviate the plights of the people. They urged the governor to use his power to ensure that troops are deployed in the community. They disclosed that the crisis in the community started when a group of people tried to enthrone someone as the traditional ruler of the community against the will of the people. They alleged that some people invaded the palace of Igwe Oliver Nnaji, kidnapped him and burnt his four vehicles. They added, “This satanic and barbaric act threw the community into chaos and has caused death of over 10 innocent individuals, including old and young who were killed by this notorious gang in a quest to satisfy their satanic ambition of their master who wants to become the traditional ruler of our community at all cost. “Moreover, 80 per cent of the houses in our community have been razed down, making 85 per cent of the populace homeless. This murderous act forced Ogwu-Aniocha people out of the community.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
