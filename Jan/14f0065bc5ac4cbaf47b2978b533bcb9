The wife of a Kaduna-based journalist, Gladys Binniyat, has raised the alarm over the deteriorating health of her husband, Luka. According to her, Luka has been unable to walk since Tuesday. Binniyat, who is a freelance journalist with Epoch Times, a United State of America-based newspaper and the spokesperson for the Southern Kaduna Peoples has reportedly been in detention since November 4, 2021, on the orders of the Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs in the state, Samuel Aruwan. Efforts to admit Luka to bail have been futile. Speaking to our correspondent on the telephone on Thursday, she lamented the treatment given to him at the prison clinic, stating that he should be taken to a better medical facility. Gladys said,”He called me on Tuesday saying that his legs are giving him issues. He said they were swollen and he could not work. “He was rushed to the prison clinic in a wheelchair. They just bandaged his legs and he gave them money to buy drugs which he used. “They took him back to the cell, before they attended to him. I don’t have confidence in the treatment they gave to him, he complained of pains at around 7 am and you gave him treatment by 6pm, if it is something that would have killed him that was how they would have left him to die. “I saw him this morning. His legs are still swollen and can’t work. I want them to release my husband for me so that he can be taken care of. “I am not sure of the kind of drugs given to him, I don’t trust them. I want him to be taken to a good medical facility for proper checkup and treatment.”
