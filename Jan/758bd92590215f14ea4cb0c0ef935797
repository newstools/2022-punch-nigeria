Speaking at the event that had in attendance former Governor of Oyo State,  Senator Rashidi Ladoja, Chief Niyi Akintola (SAN), said, “While eulogising the late Olubadan, the Araba of Ibadanland, said, “Oba Saliu Adetunji was a king that stood out among all the kings, Ibadan has ever had. “This is a king that allowed all religious groups to operate unhindered in Ibadanland.  He never discriminated against any religion. That was why his reign was peaceful  and Ibadanland  experienced  unprecedented development.” Araba of Ibadanland also urged those at the helm of affairs in Oyo state, to emulate the late monarch by ensuring that all religious groups are accomodated for the peace and development of the State.
