The Lagos State chapter of the National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives has suspended its three-day warning strike. The PUNCH reported that the state executive council of the association at its meeting on December 29, 2021 resolved to embark on a three-day warning strike from January 10 to January 12, 2022. The nurses commenced the strike on Monday to protest against poor remuneration and working conditions in the state health sector. However, the state chairman of NANNM, Mr Olurotimi Awojide, after an emergency congress of the union, said the strike would be suspended to allow government fulfil its promises. He said, “We appreciate the governor for his prompt response; we had a marathon meeting with him and other stakeholders. We are hopeful that implementation on our demands will commence immediately. “It is on this note that we are suspending the strike to give room for the implementation of our demands. All nurses in the state are expected back at their duty posts by 8am on Tuesday.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
