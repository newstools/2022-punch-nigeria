The Executive Secretary of African Academy of African Languages, Africa Union, Dr Lang Fàfa Dampha, says the objective of the inaugural edition of the African Languages Week is to demonstrate the indispensable role of African languages in the integration and sustainable peace and development of Africa. Dampha, who stated this in a statement, noted that it would also promote the dynamics of African philosophies of life through the empowerment and use of African languages. The week-long celebration runs from January 24 to 30, 2022. According to him, the celebration of African Languages Week will also be used to increase awareness and appreciation of African languages by looking at pragmatic ways of empowering and rendering them relevant to the lives of Africans. He said, “The African Languages Week is also geared to taking stock on how African languages are faring in the world of global languages so as to see where we stand in our language development endeavors. “It is also a way of developing linguistic cooperation and exchange, and assessing the necessary and vital work of developing the languages and the work that still needs to be done.” .
