The Kaduna State Police Command, on Saturday, said its operatives raided a notorious bandits’ camp in the Sabon-Birnin Forest in the Igabi Local Government Area of the state and rescued nine kidnap victims. The command’s Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammad Jalige, who disclosed this in a statement, also said the operatives, in collaboration with other security agencies, killed one bandit and arrested two others during the raid. Jalige identified those rescued as Bashir Hussain, 40; Abdullahi Adamu, 40; Lawal Habib, 17; Umar Yahuza, 31; Joseph Samuel, 43; Nazifi Sani, 20; Mohammed Shuaibu, 40; Zainab Bashir, 22; and Alheri Ibrahim, 40. He gave the names of the suspected bandits arrested as Rabe Baushe and Badamasi Usman, adding that they were taken into custody for further investigation. The police spokesman said the rescued victims had since been reunited with their families after undergoing medical check up at the police medical facility in the state. He, however, noted that one Bashir Hussain, a kidnap victim, who sustained bullet wounds, was rushed to the Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital in the Kaduna metropolis. The statement read in part, “On December 31, 2021, around 2am, operatives of the Kaduna State Police Command, in collaboration with the Force Intelligence Bureau and the Special Tactical Squad of the Force Headquarters, Abuja, and some vigilantes stormed a notorious bandits’ camp belonging to one Isiya located in the forest of Sabon Birni village of the Igabi LGA of Kaduna State. “The mission was cautiously and successfully executed, which resulted in one bandit being neutralised, while many others escaped with bullet wounds.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
