Ex-international, Ike Shorunmu, has backed the Super Eagles for a final berth at the Africa Cup of Nations, The PUNCH reports. The 33rd edition of Africa’s football showpiece begins on Sunday, January 9 with the final to hold February 6. Nigeria have made it to seven finals of the AFCON since their first appearance in the 1963 edition, winning the title in 1980, 1994 and 2013, and were losing finalists in 1984, 1988, 1990 and 2000. Speaking with The PUNCH, Shorunmu said he was confident Austin Eguavoen’s side would make it to their eight AFCON finals. “The Eagles side are very young but they are loaded with experience and I tip them for a final place at the AFCON in Cameroon. “The truth is every country is aiming to win the tournament but they need to have that positive mindset that they can do it. Adapting to their environment will also determine how well they will do. I am sure that they (Eagles) will give us a good tournament in Cameroon and make us proud.” Nigeria are in Group D with seven-time champions Egypt, Sudan and Guinea-Bissau. Copyright PUNCH.
