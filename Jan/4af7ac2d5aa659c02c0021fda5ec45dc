The Lagos State Commissioner for Agriculture, Abisola Olusanya, has urged workers of the state’s Agricultural Inputs Supply Authority to go beyond their targets in a bid to excel. Olusanya, according to a statement on Wednesday, was quoted to have said this during a retreat and capacity training organised by LAISA. She said, “The officers on various marketing techniques need to drive up sales in all the farm service centres; they need to be passionate, committed and disciplined to excel in their duties. “I want to urge the beneficiaries of this training to set for themselves a target that will motivate them to run to excel and go beyond the target set for them in the office because if they focus on the agencies’ target, they might fall short, but if they focus on outdoing the target then they have planned to excel.” The General Manager of LAISA, Mr Bolaji Balogun, said the agency’s officers were committed to boosting food production in the state. “The officers of the agency are committed to the task of supporting the ministry’s vision of boosting food production in the state by providing indigenous farmers with high-quality agricultural inputs such as seedlings, fertilisers, agro-chemicals, fishing nets and fish feeds, among others,” he said.
