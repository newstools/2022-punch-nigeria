The President of African Insurers Organisation, Mr Tope Smart, has called on insurance stakeholders on the continent to unite and address the challenges bedevilling insurance growth. Smart, in his New Year message to insurance operators in Africa, said the insurance penetration rate in Africa remained low when compared with the global average, according to a statement. “We need to bridge this gap by addressing all the challenges confronting us as a sector in Africa. With determination and commitment, we can do this,” the group managing director of NEM Insurance Plc said. While calling on African insurers to remember and renew their trust in AIO executives, he said he looked forward to a better African insurance industry in the years to come. Smart said, “The insurance industry is growing bigger, stronger, and more resilient. Together, we are working on several projects, which we believe will bring us closer and make us stronger and better. “So, it is with distinct pleasure that I join you in welcoming this New Year 2022. AIO will be celebrating 50 years of existence this year 2022 in Nairobi, Kenya and this is a milestone we need to celebrate in grand style. We have done much, and we will do more.”  Copyright PUNCH.
