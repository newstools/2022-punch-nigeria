Atlanta ’96 Olympics gold medallist Dosu Joseph has applauded the Super Eagles following their impressive performances at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. The Eagles beat favourites Egypt 1-0 in their opener, before another 3-1 triumph over Sudan on Saturday to book a spot in the tournament round of 16. Speaking with The PUNCH, Dosu said he was highly impressed with the Eagles performance at the tournament, adding that the Eagles Nigerians used to know are the ones he saw in Cameroon. “The performance of a team is a gradual process and it is also about coach too and we are having both in this situation,” Dosu, a former goalkeeper, said. “The Eagles are winning, which is what Nigerians need and they are not just winning but they are playing very well. They are very serious and play as a team. “They’ve been able to string passes together from the defence to the attack. I can say the spirit of the Super Eagles has changed, everybody can sit in their comfort zone, eat or drink and watch the Eagles play. “This is not the same situation some few months or years back. I must say that the Eagles are currently high flying even though it took a while to have the federation listen to our cry. But we are happy now and we can all say that the Eagles are back.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
