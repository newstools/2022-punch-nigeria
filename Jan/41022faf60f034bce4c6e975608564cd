Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, has alleged sabotage as a mega school inaugurated barely six months ago by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), was razed. Speaking at the school premises in Muna area of Jere Local Government Area of the state, on Tuesday, the governor said it was beyond mere coincidence for a school that has no electricity to go up in flame. He said his government will uncover the cause of the fire. Zulum said, “This school was inaugurated by President Muhammadu Buhari barely six months ago. Government has spent huge amount of money, but unfortunately, it has been completely razed down. “Preliminary investigation shows that there is some level of sabotage because I see no reason why a school like this, which has not been connected to national grid, no electricity, no power generating set, and you just see fire at the last floor of the building.” The school principal, Saidu Umaru, said 19 classrooms and three laboratories were razed on Monday morning.
