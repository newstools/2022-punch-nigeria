Activist Omoyele Sowore on Sunday said the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), transferred ‘bad luck’ to the Super Eagles of Nigeria through a video conference he had with the team earlier on Sunday shortly before the Eagles’ match with Tunisia. This is as the Eagles are out of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations after they lost 1-0 to Tunisia in their Sunday encounter in the Round of 16. The Eagles had won all their three matches at the group stage in Cameroon but lost to Tunisia to the shock of many Nigerians and international observers. Shortly before the game with Tunisia, Buhari held a video conference with Coach Austin Eguavoen from the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Buhari said, “You’ve been doing Nigeria proud. You’ve been winning. Please keep on winning. The Federal Government is supporting you, and I say thank you to all the technical crew and the players.. Please keep doing the country proud.” Reacting before the match, Sowore took to his Facebook page and said, “Just heard Muhammadu Buhari just passed his bad luck to Nigeria’s Super Eagles! We are working hard to neutralise it! #RevolutionNow.” After a shot from Youssef Msakni gave the Carthage Eagles their only goal in the game, Sowore wrote, “Muhammadu Buhari is bad luck for Super Eagles and Nigeria as whole! I said it! #RevolutionNow.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
