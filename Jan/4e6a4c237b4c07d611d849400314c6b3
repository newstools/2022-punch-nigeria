Former Nigeria head coach, Sunday Oliseh, has tipped Cameroon as a credible ‘title contender’ at the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Oliseh said the host nation is “strong, aggressive, and well organised”. The former Ajax and Juventus midfielder also said that Cameroon is fun to watch. He also said that their captain Vincent Aboubakar, who has netted five goals at the tournament so far, leads a formidable team. In a tweet after Cameroon drew with Cape Verde, Oliseh wrote, “Tall, strong, solid, aggressive, compact, hosts & relatively well organized! The indomitable Lions team, though at times static and not so nimble-footed, is definitely in my opinion, a credible title contender and Fun to watch with Aboubakar. AFCON is heating up!!” Cameroon was the first country to qualify for the 2021 AFCON round of 16 after beating Burkina Faso and Ethiopia. The Indomitable Lions finished on top of Group A with seven points after playing a 1-1 draw with Cape Verde on Monday. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
