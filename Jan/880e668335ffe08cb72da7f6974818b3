A group under the aegis of Coalition of Akko All Progressives Congress Support Group has passed vote of no confidence in the Chairman of House Committee on Police Affairs, Usman Kumo. Kumo is a House of Representatives member representing Akko Federal Constituency. Speaking during a media briefing on Monday, Chairman of the group, Khalid Kumo, said the constituency lacked purposeful and quality representation. The group bemoaned the increasing rate of crime in the constituency, linking it to wanton youth unemployment. He said, “Our constituency lacks a purposeful and quality representation it deserves in the national assembly. This has made it to become the most backward and poverty-stricken out of all the six Federal Constituencies in Gombe State. “Data available has shown that we have the greatest number of jobless youth in the state with majority of them turning into political thugs, phone snatchers and engaging in sorts of social vices.” Copyright PUNCH.
