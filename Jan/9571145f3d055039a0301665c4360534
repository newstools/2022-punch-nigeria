The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.); former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, have commiserated with the Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal, over the death of his elder brother, Bello Muhammadu. “President Muhammadu Buhari joins Sokoto Emirate Council, government and people of Sokoto State as well as family of the Governor, Rt. Honourable Aminu Waziri Tambuwal in mourning the demise of esteemed religious and community leader, Alhaji Muhammadu Bello, Wazirin Tambuwal,” a statement by Buhari’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu read. Also in a statement issued in Abuja on Wednesday by his media office, Atiku said, “I’m deeply touched and devastated by the news of your elder brother’s demise, Alhaji Bello Muhammadu, the Wazirin Tambuwal. “From what I have heard of him, he was a gentleman and a humble leader who was widely respected by his people. Such testimony is a reflection of his fine character and leadership qualities.” Governor Bello described the death as painful, noting that the people of Sokoto and humanity at large will miss his wise counsel. The governor said, “It is unfortunate that the people of Sokoto State have lost a rare gem. He was not only a blessing to the state but also to the country. “I sympathise with the people and government of Sokoto State and particularly, my brother and friend, Governor Aminu Tambuwal, and the family of the deceased. May God grant you all the fortitude to bear the loss.” According to the family, the octogenarian died on Tuesday and was buried according to Islamic rites on Wednesday.
