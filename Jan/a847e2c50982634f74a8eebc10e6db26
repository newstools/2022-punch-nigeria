Ex-Senegales International, Mamadou Diallo, has said that the Teranga Lions of Senegal have done well at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. “We told the boys to take each match one game at a time and they did,” Diallo said. The Terenga Lions of Senegale will be playing against the Stallions of Burkina Faso in the semi-final on Wednesday. Although the Senegalese team struggled to qualify in their group fixture, they have been able to surmount all obstacles to reach the semi-final in the tournament. Senegal drew in a goalless draw with Malawi, and Guinea, while beating Zimbabwe with a goal. The Lions went ahead to beat Cape Verde with two goals to nil in the Round of 16, and Equatorial Guinea, three goals to one, to reach the semi-final of the 2021 AFCON. Copyright PUNCH.
