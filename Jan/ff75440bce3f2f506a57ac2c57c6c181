Italian Serie A side Venezia and Spanish LaLaliga club Alaves have entered the race for out of favour Bordeaux striker, Josh Maja, Saturday PUNCH reports. The striker has only made four appearances for the Ligue 1 side this season and Bordeaux will be hoping to take his €90,000 monthly salary off their wage bill after putting former Arsenal captain Laurent Koscielny off their wage bill. Apart from the Serie A and LaLiga side, several English Championship teams including Birmingham City and Blackburn Rovers have indicated their interest in signing the player on loan but Bordeaux are looking to sell the striker out permanently. Despite the interest from Spain and Italy, sports daily say the striker is only interested in a return to England. The Nigeria international has been plagued with a back injury that saw him miss Bordeaux’s first 18 league games of the ongoing campaign. Maja was on loan to Fulham in the Premier League last season but failed to help the side maintain their topflight status. His compatriot, Samuel Kalu, recently joined English Premier League side Watford on a €4m four-and-a-half-year deal.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
