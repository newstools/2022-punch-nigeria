The Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello, has condemned the kidnapping of some Chinese working in the state on Tuesday and appealed to security personnel to double efforts to ensure the victims’ safe return. In a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mary Noel, in Minna on Thursday, the governor expressed concern over the boldness displayed by the terrorists to have attacked the workers in the presence of security personnel attached to the site where they were working. He emphasised the need for security agents to bring criminal activities in some parts of the state to the lowest level, particularly now that the perpetrators had been declared as terrorists by the Federal Government. The governor, however, commended the efforts of the security personnel, who engaged the kidnappers. He stated that the abduction would cause a setback to the delivery of ongoing projects. “The attack is really disturbing as it will cause some setbacks to the Zungeru Dam project, which the Federal Government has been making efforts to complete in record time,” Bello stated. He expressed sadness over the loss of lives during the abduction, adding that it was an unfortunate incident that should not reoccur in the state. The governor added, “It really saddened my heart to hear about this attack. It is even more worrisome to know that the lives of labourers were involved. This action may negatively affect the completion of the Zungeru Dam, which is of great significance to the country. “My heart goes out to the families of the labourers who were killed and those injured; I pray that Allah will grant them quick recovery.” Copyright PUNCH.
