The Lagos State Government has partnered with Del-York Creative Academy to train 100 new filmmakers through the Lagos Creative Industry Initiative programme. The Commissioner for Tourism, Arts and Culture, Mrs Uzamat Akinbile-Yussuf, said this in a statement on Saturday. Akinbile-Yussuf was quoted to have spoken during the graduation of the trainees who received higher diploma certificates in filmmaking. She said, “The state government and Del-York have invested huge resources to consistently empower youths within and outside the country in different aspects of filmmaking, through exposure to modern film production techniques and the use of the latest equipment in the industry. “I congratulate the 100 trainees on the completion of the programme and I want to encourage them to continue in their drive towards success in their chosen career paths.” The President of Del-York Creative Academy, Mr Linus Idahosa, described the graduating students as refined products that will make a difference. “All our graduating students here today are refined products that have gone through the furnace to come out as purest gold. “This process was to ensure that they are not just creators, but are game-changers. We have handed you the tools to change your narrative and your lives, such that your families and this nation will become proud of you. So, go out there and make that difference,” he said.
