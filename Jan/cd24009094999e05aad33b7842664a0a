The Lagos State Government has called on miners and other relevant stakeholders in the state to observe relevant sand mining policies that will safeguard the health of residents. The Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources, Mr Olalere Odusote, said this on Wednesday during a meeting with stakeholders in Alausa, Ikeja. He said, “Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu wants the state government, traditional rulers and relevant stakeholders to be on the same page concerning all the relevant policies and laws as they relate to sand mining because the land is a major asset to the state government and must be deliberately managed according to relevant laws. “This meeting will make it easier for the government to fulfill its functions to the stakeholders on mining-related issues in a manner that will promote sound health for residents of the various mining communities and guarantee environmental sustainability.” The Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Shasore Sholabomi, said the plans of the government regarding the mining sector can only be achieved by working together with all stakeholders. “The state government has plans in place for this sector but despite the plans already outlined by the government, we realised that we must work with all our stakeholders including security operatives, tipper associations and garage owners to achieve our plans for the mining sector,” she said. The Chairman of the Mining Forum, Lagos State chapter, Mr Akeem Abogun, urged the state government to tackle the issue of illegal miners and curb activities of impostors in the sector.
