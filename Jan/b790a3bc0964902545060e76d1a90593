The Delta State Government has promised to come up with a comprehensive plan to assist the victims of the Ogbe-Ijoh market in Warri, which was razed by fire last Sunday. The state Governor, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa, gave the pledge on Friday during a visit to the market to see the extent of damage as he sympathised with the victims of the fire disaster. Okowa, who was represented by his Deputy, Kingsley Otuaro, expressed the government’s concern over the incessant fire disasters at the Ogbe-Ijoh market. He however assured that the state government would liaise with the Warri South Local Council and the market leadership to help the traders. The deputy governor, who said the market had an original design with fire service station, police station and other facilities, stated that the government needed to look critically at the fire disasters in the market. He said, “I am here to actually see for myself the level of damage occasioned by the fire a few days ago. We are very much concerned as a government and we are worried because this appears not to be the first time we have had an inferno in this market. We need to look critically into what has over time constituted this perennial fire outbreak and to see what we can do.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
