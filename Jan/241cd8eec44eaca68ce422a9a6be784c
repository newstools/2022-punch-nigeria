The Kogi State Governor, Mr Yahaya Bello, has urged governments and private organisations to patronise indigenous contractors and engineers, saying such gesture possesses great ripple benefits to local economy. Bello said this when he visited the project site of the ongoing construction of the Lokoja Civic Centre, according to a statement issued late Sunday night by his Chief Press Secretary, Onogwu Mohammed. He expressed satisfaction with the pace and quality of work delivered so far. According to him, the civic centre is one among the several infrastructural facelifts ongoing in the capital city of Lokoja in a bid to position it as the befitting capital of the confluence state. He added that the government was carrying out numerous infrastructural projects which it said would be completed, despite the meager funds available and the numerous obligations to its citizens and other financial demands. Earlier, the contractor of the project, Friday Idachaba commended the governor for trusting an indigenous contractor and assured him that the job would be delivered in a week. According to him, the civic centre has a capacity to seat over 15,000 people, a spacious car park, male and female convenience rooms, dressing rooms and other facilities as well as a close circuit camera for security purposes and floodlights to enhance illumination for night activities.”Copyright PUNCH.
