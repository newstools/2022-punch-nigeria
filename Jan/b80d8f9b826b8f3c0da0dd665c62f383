MEDIA mogul, Dele Momodu, has said that his presidential bid would not be intimidated by anyone who feels they can buy the whole of Nigeria with loads of cash fraudulently and illegally filched and taken from the Nigerian people. He stated this while informing the Peoples Democratic Party of his intention to contest for the party’s presidential ticket. Momodu disclosed this at the PDP National Secretariat in Abuja, on Thursday,  where he formally presented his letter of intent to the National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu. In his letter to the party’s chairman, Momodu congratulated him, noting that Nigerians are ready to restore hope, which began with the late Moshood Abiola. Momodu wrote: “I’m convinced that the time has come to seriously challenge and dislodge those politicians who have held our country to ransom by kidnapping, hijacking and destroying the future of our younger generation and generations yet unborn. “I’m better prepared now than at the time of my first foray into the fray in 2011, and I am fully ready and certainly capable for the onerous tasks and responsibilities ahead.” Copyright PUNCH.
