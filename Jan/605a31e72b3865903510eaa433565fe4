Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang missed Gabon’s Africa Cup of Nations clash with Ghana due to minor heart issues. Gabon Football Federation said in a statement that the player was stopped from playing by the Confederation of African Football. Aubameyang, 32, tested positive for coronavirus upon arrival in Cameroon last week and subsequently missed Gabon’s 1-0 victory over Comoros on Monday, his country’s opening game in Group C. Gabon head coach Patrice Neveu also tested positive prior to tonight’s game and did not travel to Yaounde’s Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo. Apart from Aubameyang, CAF’s medical commission also identified ‘cardiac lesions’ in Axel Meye and Mario Lemina. The three players earlier missed Gabon’s opening victory over Comoros after testing positive for coronavirus. “According to the Caf medical commission, the players Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Axel Meye and Mario Lemina, barely out of Covid, cannot take part in the match,” read a statement on the Gabon Football Federation Twitter handle. “The examinations have shown cardiac lesions, and Caf did not want to take any risks.” Copyright PUNCH.
