LEADERS in Ogun West Senatorial District have canvassed the adoption of a consensus governorship candidate from the region ahead of the 2023 governorship election. The stakeholders, who include a former Deputy Governor of the state,  Salmat Badru, said a consensus arrangement is the only solution to the alleged marginalisation crisis in the region. The leaders under the auspices of Ogun West Stakeholders Forum stated this on Thursday at a forum tagged, ‘Ogun West Engage Series 2,’ held in  Ilaro. The forum, which comprises professionals, businessmen, technocrats, civil servants and politicians from Ogun West claimed that disunity among the indigenes and personal interests were the major reasons the region had not produced a governor. They also lamented the continuous unfavourable representation of the region in the distribution of political appointments and infrastructure development, urging Governor Dapo Abiodun not to follow the path of his predecessors.
