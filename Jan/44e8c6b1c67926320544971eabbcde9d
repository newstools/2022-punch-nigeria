The Kano State Government has banned men and women from swimming in the same pool, smoking shisha, and entry of children into hotels. These laws were enforced by the state’s Task Force on Tourism Development Levy, according to Sahara Reporters. The Chairman of the Committee, Baffa Dan-Agundi, stated these laws following a meeting with hotel and event centre owners. He said, “Part of our term of reference is to stop underage children from entering hotels without their parents, banning shisha smoking, swimming between men and women in the pool, lesbianism, and gay practices. “The committee will further oversee the activities of DJs at wedding ceremonies and event centres. All events centres should be closed by 11 pm.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
