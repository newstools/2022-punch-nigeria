The Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Obafemi Hamzat, has said that the opinion that Nigeria’s problem is leadership is not 100 per cent correct. Hamzat said the problem is that the family has broken up and there is a lack of personal responsibility in the country. The deputy governor said this over the weekend at the commissioning of the Ultra-Modern Quranic Central Mosque and Turbaning of Admiral Jubrila Ayinla and his wife, Alhaja Jemilah Ayinla, as the New Baba Adinni and Amira Tul-Mehmeen of Quranic Muslim Community respectively. He said, “A lot of people are of the opinion that the problem of Nigeria is leadership. Well, l want to say that, it is not 100% correct in my view. The problem is that the family has broken up and there is a lack of personal responsibility in the country. Many people have left their responsibilities undone which is having negative effects on the society and country at large.” He, therefore, called on all citizens irrespective of their religion to see personal responsibility as important and play their roles effectively and efficiently, adding that leadership starts from the home which is the bedrock of any developed society. This is as he called on religious leaders in the state to focus their sermons on the importance of personal responsibility and family values in a bid to tackle the myriads of problems facing the country.
