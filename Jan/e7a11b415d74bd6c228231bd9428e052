The Lagos State Government has said it will work towards a compilation of e-surveys to be issued to land allottees in the state. The Permanent Secretary, Office of the State Surveyor-General, Olutomi Sangowawa, said this in a statement on Saturday. Sangowawa was quoted to have said this while receiving delegates from the state Land Use Allocation Committee in his office. He said, “We are working towards future plans that would upscale available schemes due to the need for adequate resources that will promote effective performance and this is why we are collaborating with the LUAC not only to foster a mutual relationship between both institutions, but also to come up with statistics required for the compilation of e-surveys for better service delivery. “The issuance of these e-surveys to allottees will improve turnaround time and the professional expertise in the Office of the State Surveyor-General; it will bring about a seamless workflow between our team and the LUAC for excellent service delivery to Lagos residents.” The Executive Secretary, Lands Bureau, Mrs Lolade Ajetunmobi, said her team’s visit was aimed at discussing better ways of achieving the ultimate goal in respect of land and survey matters in the state. “There is an urgent need for us to work as a team in order to curb hindrances emanating from communication gap so that we can continually project the good work of the state government,” she said.
