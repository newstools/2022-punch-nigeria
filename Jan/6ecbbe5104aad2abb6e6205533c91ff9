Bandits have raided Gbagyi community in the Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State, killing a resident and abducting 10 others. The bandits, who invaded the community around 10pm on Monday, rode on motorcycles, with each carrying two gang members. A resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the bandits entered the community through the riverside. He explained that a man who attempted to make a call after seeing the hoodlums was shot dead. The source noted that the bandits abducted 10 residents, including women and children. He said, “The bandits operated for about two hours and went away with no fewer than 10 persons. They killed one person. “When they entered the community through the riverside, they started shooting sporadically and members of the community ran helter-skelter. They went away with women and children. Members of the same family were among the victims. “As I speak, many residents are fleeing Gbagyi to neighbouring Television, Sabo and Ungwan Gimbiya, that is not also safe. “We are calling on the government to do more by deploying troops in the area. Some of us are retired workers who deserve rest. We built houses of our own, but can’t live here because of bandits. Most of the houses here are empty because their owners fled.” As of the time of filing this report, there was no official confirmation of the attack by the state government or the state police command. The state police spokesman, ASP Mohammad Jalige, did not take his calls which rang out. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
