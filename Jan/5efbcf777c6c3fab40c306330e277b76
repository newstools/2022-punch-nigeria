A member of staff at the National Assembly slipped and fell at a staircase and died on Monday. Eyewitnesses said Abdul Abayomi, 34, tripped and fell on the upper rung of the staircase while ascending the second floor of the White House section of the National Assembly Complex. Cleaners, who sighted him when he fell, were said to have alerted other workers who immediately came to his aid. His colleagues were said to have taken him to the National Assembly Clinic for medical attention but he died on the way. He was said to have died of cardiac arrest and other underlining ailments. The deceased was with the Inter-Parliamentary Department under the Directorate of Inter-Parliamentary and Protocols of the National Assembly’s bureaucracy. He was said to have married on December 4, 2021. While he was from Osun State, his wife is said to be from Delta State. Also, an ad hoc worker was said to have fallen from a scaffold while working at the fourth floor of the National Assembly Complex which left him with a deep cut on his head, aside other injuries. The worker was said to have been taken to the National Hospital where he is receiving medical attention. The injured worker is said to be recuperating. When contacted, the Director of Information, National Assembly, Dr Emmanuel Agada, said he could not confirm the death since he has not received any information on it. “Honestly, I just left the office but I didn’t get any such information on the incident. So I am not in a position now to confirm the story,” Agada said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
