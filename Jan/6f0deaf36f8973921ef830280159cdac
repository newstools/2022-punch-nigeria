The All Progressives Congress has distanced itself from a list making the rounds that detailed purported zoning of offices announced by the Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Mai Mala Buni. This is according to a disclaimer signed on Wednesday by the APC’s Director-General, Press and Media Affairs, Mamman Mohammed. The disclaimer read in part, “The attention of the Governor of Yobe State and Chairman APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Mai Mala Buni, has been drawn to media publications with purported zoning of offices allegedly announced by him. “He has in clear and unambiguous terms denied the said list, saying, it is false, baseless, unfounded, misleading and has nothing to do with him.” Buni said the APC has not taken any decision at any fora on anything relating to the zoning of offices. He said, “The publication is just a figment of the author’s imagination that has nothing to do with the Chairman and the party. “The public is hereby urged to disregard the purported list as it is misleading and completely false.” The Chairman urged the press to resist unverified stories, and rumours, and to always verify all issues related to the party, promising that the doors of the party are always open.
