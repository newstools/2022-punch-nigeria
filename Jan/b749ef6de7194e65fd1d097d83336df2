Super Eagles interim coach Austin Eguavoen held crucial talks with Almeria striker Sadiq Umar over his performance at the ongoing African Cup of Nations, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Umar has struggled to impress at the tournament, despite scoring in the Eagles 2-0 win over Guinea-Bissau in their final Group D game. Eguavoen revealed that he advised the former Glasgow Rangers striker to try to make assists as he bids to settle into the team. Taiwo Awoniyi has been Eguavoen’s first choice striker at the tournament, with the Union Berlin marksman scoring once in two appearances so far. “Yes, I had a personal discussion with him (Umar),” Eguavoen said ahead of his side’s game against the Carthage Eagles. “We have a lot of confidence in him and he is an integral part of the team. He has been scoring a lot of goals in Spain but this is the national team. “He should look out for assists before thinking of scoring so as to grow his confidence. “But he told me as a striker his job is to score goals, which I understand. That’s the instinct of a good striker. If you have a chance to make an assist do it and if you have a chance to score get the goal.” On Sunday (today) Nigeria play Tunisia in the round of 16 after ending the group stage with three wins in three games. The Tunisians only managed to qualify as one of the best third-place sides. The match will be Eguavoen’s 16th for Nigeria across three stints, during which he walked off the pitch victorious in 13 of the previous 15, with only two narrow defeats. He is also the only man to have coached Nigeria to win all three group phase matches at the AFCON, achieving this in 2006 and 2022. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
