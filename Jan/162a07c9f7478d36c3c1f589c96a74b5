The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has said it is the bounden duty of leaders, particularly within the West African sub-region, to do the best for their people, despite shrinking resources. He said this while receiving, in the farewell audience, the Ambassador of Burkina Faso, Piabie Firmin Gregoire N’do, at the State House in Abuja, on Friday. This was disclosed in a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina. “Leaders should do the best for their people within the limits of resources,” Buhari affirmed, adding that he hoped the outgoing Ambassador would use experiences garnered in the field “for decision making in your country when you go back.” On his part, Ambassador N’do who had spent eight years on tour of duty said he enjoyed his stay in Nigeria, had his last daughter here and holds very pleasant memories of the country. This is as Buhari jocularly asked if he gave his daughter Nigerian names. N’do expressed the good wishes of his country, and of himself to Nigeria, commending Buhari for good diplomacy, which has seen Nigerians leading many international organisations. He equally expressed appreciation for different kinds of support from Nigeria to Burkina Faso during the flooding crisis, their national elections, and at many other critical times. Copyright PUNCH.
