Gunmen on Sunday shot dead a petrol dealer at Okeluse community in the Ose Local Government Area of Ondo State. The deceased, said to be the owner of a petrol station in the area, was identified as Aborowa Oladimeji, aka Popular. According to the police, a petrol attendant, whose identity was not revealed, was also shot during the attack. An eyewitness, who asked not to be identified, said the assailants stormed the community around 9pm and opened fire on the duo. Another resident described the gunmen as Fulani herdsmen who had been terrorising the community. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mrs Funmilayo Odunlami, confirmed the incident, but said it was a case of attempted kidnapping. She noted that the attendant was receiving treatment at a hospital where he was rushed to after the attack. Odunlami said the police and other security agents were on the trail of the perpetrators. She said, “Five men on a motorcycle opened fire on the people. While the owner of the filling station died, the attendant survived. As I am talking to you, our men and other security agents are already in the area, trailing the hoodlums.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
