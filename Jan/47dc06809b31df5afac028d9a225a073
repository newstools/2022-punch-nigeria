Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, has said his decision to depose the paramount ruler of Otuokpoti community in the Ogbia Local Government Area of the state, Cousin Wongo, cannot be revoked. Diri stated this at a reception in the community shortly after inaugurating a divisional police station constructed by the Ogbia council chairman, Ebinyon Turner, on Thursday. The governor had on Monday announced the removal of the monarch, the community development committee chairman and the youth president over their alleged complicity in the kidnap of the Commissioner for Industry, Trade and Investment, Federal Otokito, from his residence in the community on January 20. The Otokito regained his freedom about five days after with injuries inflicted on him by his abductors. Diri, who spoke against the backdrop of protest from some quarters against the traditional ruler’s dethronement, said his pronouncement was final and there is nothing anybody could do about it. He said, “I did not depose your paramount ruler because I hated him. The circumstances that led to his dethronement are known to me and the commissioner of police and that deposition stands. Anybody that is protesting, I am very sorry. “As a governor, once I make a pronouncement, that is it. Nobody can do anything about it. In the Constitution and the laws of Bayelsa on chieftaincy and traditional rulers, the final authority lies with the governor.” The governor also disclosed that the police commissioner had earlier hinted that the state command had its searchlight on the community before the kidnap of his cabinet member. He called on the newly appointed paramount ruler, Rescue Abe, to unite Otuokpoti people and not allow the community to be used for criminal and illegal oil refining activities as the government would not condone crime and criminality.
