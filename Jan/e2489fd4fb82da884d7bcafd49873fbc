Abia State Governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu has called for calm from all the parties involved in the crisis in Owaza, Ukwa West Local Government Area, where the Nigerian Army is allegedly having issues with the community over the alleged killing of some soldiers. Ikpeazu urged them to give peace a chance and allow the state government to find a solution to the matter. The governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Onyebuchi Ememanka, said, “The governor expresses concerns regarding the ongoing reprisal attacks in Owaza by soldiers of the Nigerian Army following the alleged killing of a soldier in the community, and tasks the soldiers to show a high level of patriotism and not allow the situation to degenerate any further, as the state government continues to engage the leadership of the Army on the issue.” Meanwhile, the local government’s Chairman, Chief Okey Kanu, has also condemned the killing of the soldiers on duty along Obibor-Owaza Pipeline Road, saying the perpetrators must be brought to book. Some soldiers attached to 144 Brigade of the Nigerian Army were reportedly killed by yet-to-be identified persons between the boundaries of Obibor Obuzor and Umuagalaba Owaza. This incident has forced residents of the affected communities to desert their villages as military personnel lay siege to all the communities around Owaza and Obuzor Asa. Copyright PUNCH.
