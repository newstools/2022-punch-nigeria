Residents of the Basorun area of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, on Friday, panicked after a fuel tanker was engulfed in fire at a filling station. The PUNCH reports that the tanker was discharging fuel to the underground tank at Olarem Filling Station when the fire started beneath the truck and before the tanker was engulfed in fire, the driver was said to have jumped inside and driven it away to the roadside. A photographer, Dotun Omiyale, who lives in the neighbourhood narrated via his Twitter handle that it took the three fire fighting water trucks to put out the fire.      Copyright PUNCH.
