Policemen and vigilante in Maihula, Bali Local Government Area of Taraba State on Thursday turned back over 600 strangers who came into community in two trucks. Residents told our correspondent that the youth, vigilante and policemen in the area prevented the strangers who allegedly came in from Zamfara from settling in the area. It was gathered that residents of the area woke up to see over 600 strangers trying to settle in their community. Mr Terna Iortyer told our correspondent that the development caused tension in the area. He said, “The strangers came into the town in two trucks and there was tension as their mission was unknown. “The youth in the area initially wanted to use force on the strangers, but were prevented by the elders and policemen in the community. “You know there have been cases of kidnapping in the state and Governor Darius Ishaku recently raised the alarm over regrouping of terrorists in the state and we had every reason to be afraid. “The strangers have left, but the youth are still on the alert and are turning back any strange vehicle coming into the town.” Further checks by our correspondent revealed that people fleeing Zamfara, Katsina and Sokoto States as a result of banditry are already in some communities in the state. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Usman Abdullahi, said he was not aware of the movement of the strangers into the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
