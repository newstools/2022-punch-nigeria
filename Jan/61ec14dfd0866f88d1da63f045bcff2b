State governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congresson Sunday evening met being closed-door  at the Kebbi State Governors’ Lodge, Abuja. The emergency meeting was part of efforts geared towards tackling the crisis rocking the party. Although the Progressives Governors’ Forum Chairman, Abubakar Bagudu, did not disclose the issues to be discussed at the meeting, it is believed that the core agenda is to clear the air over the date for the party’s national convention. While some governors and stakeholders are opposing an alleged plan to retain the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, others are calling on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to intervene. There are heightened tensions between the forum;s members who want a February convention and those who are seeking a postponement. The various lawsuits filed by disgruntled party members from various states were also expected to form part of discussion.
