Nigerian singer, Timi Dakolo, on Thursday noted that people can be really famous and still be broke. The award-winning artiste made this known in a tweet that read, ” You can be really famous, I mean really really famous and still be broke.” Dakolo, who is known for sharing insightful and motivational posts on his social media pages had recently advised beginners to give themselves time to grow. The singer tweeted this on his page on Tuesday, when he noted that one’s beginnings should not be compared to another person’s experience. “Just so you know. Nobody started really really good. We learnt on the job. Your beginnings shouldn’t be compared to someone’s 10 years of experience. That’s so unfair to what you are building. Give yourself time to grow,” the tweet read.
