A fake lawyer arrested in Zamfara State, Chukwuka Jude, has been sentenced to one year imprisonment by the Chief Magistrate Court One in Gusau, the state capital. The Chief Magistrate, Sa’adu Gurbin-Bore, said having admitted committing the crime, the defendant was convicted accordingly. “Impersonation and cheating are punishable offences under Section 179 and 324 of the Panel Code with three years jail term and seven years jail term with fine or both,” he said. But the defendant’s counsel, Joseph Eze, urged the chief magistrate to temper justice with mercy as the accused person is a family man with seven unemployed children. “The accused person also suffered fire outbreak twice, hence there is the need to grant him soft sentence,” he added. But the chief magistrate ruled, “Considering the plea by the counsel to the defendant, Chukwuka Jude is therefore sentenced to one year imprisonment for cheating. “He is also sentenced to six months imprisonment or N50,000 fine as an option for impersonation.” He said if the fine was not paid, convict would serve the two jail terms concurrently.
