The Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, on Friday, pledged the loyalty of the military leadership to democratic rule in the country. Irabor made this known during an interview on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television’s programme, ahead of the Armed Forces Remembrance Day. “Today, I believe that Nigerians are no longer in doubt as to the subordination of the military to civil rule; I believe that no one is in doubt that democracy has come to stay,” he said amid the recent military takeover of government in some African countries. “I believe that no one is in doubt any longer that the current military leadership, and of course, since the democratisation in 1999, that the military is well focused to perform its constitutional roles,” he added. His statement came amid recent military coups in West African countries such as Mali and Guinea; as well as North-Eastern nation, Sudan. Irabor admitted that some Nigerians might still be struggling with the experience of military involvement in politics in the past. Speaking on the significance of the Armed Forces Remembrance Day, Irabor stressed the need to educate the coming generation about the nation’s history. “Going forward, I believe that some of these misperceptions that some Nigerians have had with respect to military engagement will begin to change,” he said.
