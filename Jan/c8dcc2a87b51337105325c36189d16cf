Former Super Eagles goalkeeper Dele Aiyenugba has advised Maduka Okoye to move on from the disappointment of Nigeria’s exit from the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon and focus on his career. The Eagles crashed out of the competition after losing 1-0 to Tunisia on Sunday, with fans claiming Okoye was to blame for the defeat. The ball hit the ground just before getting to Okoye, who could only parry into his own net, but Aiyenugba, who attended the AFCON in 2006, 2008 and 2010, says the mistake could happen to the best keepers in the world. “That shot could beat any goalkeeper in the world if you’re not well placed. Even if it was an error from the keeper, you must have the ability to learn from the mistake,” Aiyenugba told PUNCH Sports Extra.’’ “As a footballer you get abuses and criticisms but you need to move past them. “Anyone can make mistakes and most times we as goalkeepers pray that those mistakes don’t cost us games. If Nigeria had ended up winning the game, no one would talk about the error.’’ Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
