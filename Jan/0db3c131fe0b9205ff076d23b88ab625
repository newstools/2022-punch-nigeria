Men of the Ogun State Police Command have arrested the pastor in charge of Spirit-Filled International Christian Church, Olumore, Abeokuta, Timothy Oluwatimilehin, for allegedly luring a housewife and her two daughters away from their family. The randy pastor allegedly kept them in his house, where he had carnal knowledge of all of them. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday. Oyeyemi said the pastor was arrested following a complaint lodged at the Adatan Police Station by the woman’s husband. The PPRO explained that the husband was accompanied by an official of the state ministry of women affairs to the police station to lodge the complaint. Oyeyemi said the husband complained that his wife and two daughters were lured by the pastor, who took them into his custody and started having sex with them. He said, “Upon the report, the DPO, Adatan division, SP Abiodun Salau, detailed his detectives to effect the arrest of the randy pastor. “On interrogation, the pastor confessed to the crime, but pleaded for forgiveness. “In his confession, he explained that he took advantage of a little misunderstanding between the woman and her husband to carry out the devilish act.” The PPRO said the state Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, had directed the anti-human trafficking and child labour unit of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department to take over the case and investigate it with a view to charging the suspect to court.
