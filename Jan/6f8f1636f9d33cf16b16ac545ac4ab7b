Leganes defender Kenneth Omeruo is a major doubt for the Super Eagles second group game against Sudan on Saturday at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations tournament, The PUNCH reports. Omeruo partnered William Troost-Ekong in the Eagles defence as Nigeria comfortably beat seven-time champions Egypt in their Africa Cup of Nations Group D opener at the Stade Roumde Adjia stadium in Garuoa on Tuesday. Leicester City forward Kelechi Iheanacho scored the match-winner for the Eagles in the 30th minute, burying a stunning half-volley on the turn –- in his first game of the tournament. Omeruo, 28, who was making his third AFCON appearance, was however replaced in the 79th minute for Semi Ajayi after he went down unchallenged. He is expected to undergo some tests to ascertain the extent of the injury later today. Should Omeruo fail to shrug off the injury, interim coach Austin Eguavoen could call on either West Brom defender Ajayi or Chidozie Awaziem for the game as they bid to qualify for the round of 16. Omeruo made his debut at the AFCON in 2013, when Nigeria lifted the title for the third time in South Africa. He has 55 appearances for the Eagles, scoring once. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
