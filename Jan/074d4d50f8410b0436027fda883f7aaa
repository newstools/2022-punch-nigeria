Strong indications have emerged that commissioner-nominees and those to be appointed by the incoming governor of Anambra State, Prof Charles Soludo, will be subjected to oral and written interviews before a panel of judges to merit their positions. The Coordinator, Anambra Leadership Forum, Mr Samuel Ejimofor, an aide to Soludo, disclosed this in Awka on Tuesday. Ejimofor advised those, who have been visiting Soludo’s country home in Isuofia, Aguata Local Government Area of the state, to lobby for appointments to stop such. He said they should rather prepare their resumes and wait for the governor-elect’s swearing-in after which the panel on appointments would be set up. He added that there was increased pressure to enlarge the transition committee from the present 80 members to 90 given the short time available to complete its assignment. Ejimofor, “People should not be in a hurry to be lobbying for appointments because the old system of someone introducing their relations and imposing people on the governor and forcing it down his throat has gone. “As for the transition committee, the time is short considering the terms of reference, so those who think that the number is too large do not seem to know the enormity of the work that is before the members as well as the pressure for the number to be increased to about 90 or thereabout.” Copyright PUNCH.
