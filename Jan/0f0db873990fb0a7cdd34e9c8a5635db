As part of its ongoing 2022 Zero Accident Campaign, the Lagos State Safety Commission has sealed some lounges and nightclubs within the Lekki and Victoria Island areas of the state for violating safety regulations. The Director-General of LSC, Mr Lanre Mojola, said this in a statement on Tuesday, adding that the campaign would reduce accidents that could result in injury and fatalities. He said, “As part of our ongoing 2022 Zero Accident Campaign, several lounges and nightclubs within the Lekki and Victoria Island areas of the state have been sealed. The owners of some of these establishments showed flagrant disregard to the state government regulations to register with the safety commission through its portal, despite different attempts to ensure their compliance. “Other infractions include non-regularisation of their safety documents, such as obtaining the Safety Compliance Certificate as required by law. They also lacked fire extinguishers, cleared marked exit routes with appropriate safety signages, and there were also food safety concerns, poor hygiene and housekeeping as other safety infractions identified by the commission.” Mojola added that the agency would continue to carry out enforcement exercises in other public facilities. “The enforcement exercises will continue regularly across the state until such facilities comply and as such we enjoin owners and operators of such facilities to seek a safety-first policy as this preserves their businesses and enhances the well-being of not only their staff but also visiting members of the public,” he said.
