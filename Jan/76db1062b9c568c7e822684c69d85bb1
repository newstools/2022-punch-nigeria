A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party in Ogun State, Mr Segun Showunmi, has urged the Federal Government to revisit calls for restructuring this year. Showunmi, in his New Year message, said, “The country has wobbled enough and if it will ever become the giant of Africa that it is supposed to be, it must set machinery in motion in the New Year to allow the spirit and ideals of restructuring to flow unhindered.” The PDP chieftain also expressed displeasure over what he described as the lackadaisical way the Federal Government had been fighting the anti-graft war in the country and asked it to go after corrupt governors. He stated, “Many conversations have occurred as to how do we live within the shared national boundary, Nigeria? Some have captured it under the popular term restructuring, which to their minds, a roundtable will be needed to take in the views of all ethnic nationalities. “Much thought given to the idea has left me with a settled opinion that yes, we must give more powers and authority to the constituent components of our country, as it will unleash our potential as a rainbow nation and it will engender peace, progress and prosperity.” Copyright PUNCH.
