THE All Progressives Grand Alliance has chided the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Chief Andy Uba, over the latter’s comments on the Anambra airport. Uba had on Thursday, after landing at the airport for the first time, hailed Governor Willie Obiano, for “providing the state with a functional airport”. He, therefore, called on all the stakeholders in the state to be committed to the development of the state, irrespective of party differences. However, the National Coordinator, APGA Media Warriors, Chinedu Obigwe, dismissed the claims by the APC stalwart. In a statement in Awka on Sunday, Obigwe said the claims that Uba hailed Obiano over the airport facility was only “an afterthought remedial steps aimed at covering his shame of fighting tooth and nail to stop the commencement of flights operation at the airport”. Obigwe said over 2,000 passengers had passed through the Anambra airport without hiding their excitement over its state-of-art facilities, adding that Uba’s excitement was not unique. Obigwe said, “What is good is good and that thing that is good is what Obiano has done for Ndi Anambra and that is what Uba is also enjoying, even though, he tried to stop it. “Uba alighted from his private jet like a thief in the night that was hiding from being recognised because of his past deeds.” “He arrived at the airport in company with Amb. Jerry Ugokwe, Hon. John Emeka, Hon. Carter Umeh and others. He did not talk to any journalists rather he was hiding from them and avoided getting closer to them. He left without inspecting the good works done at the airport.” Copyright PUNCH Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
