The Peoples Democratic Party in Osun State has demanded a free and transparent governorship election in the state from the Independent National Electoral Commission. INEC had fixed July 16, 2022 for the governorship election in the state. Oladele Oluwabamiji, the Director, Media and Publicity of a faction of PDP in the state backed by Senator Ademola Adeleke, told Saturday PUNCH that the conduct of Osun poll by INEC would determine the fate of 2023 general elections. Oluwabamiji, who said there must not be a repeat of controversies that dogged 2018 governorship election in the state, added that the rest of the world would be watching how the electoral commission would manage the governorship election. He said, “There is nothing we expect than to be fair as the umpire. The kind of scenario that we witness in 2018 should not repeat itself. “I hope INEC will not try the will of Osun people this time around. They should be able to gauge the temperature; they should be able to feel how the pulse of the people of Osun State is wired, vis-a-vis what happened in the last election and INEC being fair would be the least that people will expect from them. “They should be fair, not just in the interest of Osun State, but also in their own interest too because Osun election being the gateway to other national elections will tell us a lot about what to expect in the subsequent national elections.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
