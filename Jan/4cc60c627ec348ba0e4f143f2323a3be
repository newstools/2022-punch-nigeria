Some terrorists on motorcycles on Sunday stormed Damari village in Birnin-Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State, forcing the villagers to flee the area. It was gathered that the terrorists were in search of one Abba, a notorious terrorist who was said to be in charge of the area and had been declared wanted by the Kaduna State Police Command, since 2020. But there was no official reaction from either the state government or the state police command as the state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammad Jalige, said he had yet to contact the officer in charge of the area as of the time of filing this report. The terrorists were said to be on a revenge mission to Damari area said to be Abba’s stronghold. The fight among the gangs had claimed several lives since Friday. The source said, “The bandits invaded the village in large number, riding on many motorbikes. One motorcycle was carrying two passengers. “The bandits were said to be looking for members of the Abba group, a notorious bandit leader said to be in control of the area. “The bandits stormed the village on Sunday morning, shooting sporadically while the villagers ran in different direction for their own lives.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
