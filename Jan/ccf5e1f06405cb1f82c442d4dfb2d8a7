Controversy has surrounded the rice and the N500,000 Christmas gift from Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun to his loyalists in Ijebu North Local Government Area of the state . Three persons have been arrested and detained for tampering with the gifts . But a lawyer, A.D. Sosanwo, has demanded a N10m damage from the Ijebu Ode Area Police Command  for unlawfully detaining the  three persons whom he described as  his clients . Sosanwo, in a petition to the police which was copied to the Inspector -General of Police and the Ogun State Commissioner of Police, explained that his clients were arrested on January 2 and 3, 2022 and were being detained beyond the specific constitutional period. He identified the detainees as Morufu Idowu, Adebayo Rabiu and Wasiu Raji, adding that they were arrested on the order of the Secretary to the State Government, Mr Tokunbo Talabi. According to the petition, the men were arrested by police officers in Ago-Iwoye and transferred to Ijebu -Ode Area Command. They were   accused of taking some bags of rice meant to be distributed. The lawyer explained that the Area Commander demanded that the bags of rice be returned following which the matter would  be resolved amicably. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
