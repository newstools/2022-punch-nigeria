Residents said the gunmen attacked Makurdi community in the council on Tuesday night. It was further revealed that those abducted included a woman and her two children. The incident reportedly took place at 10pm. One of residents, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, “The bandits started their operations in the community from the residence of one Alhaji Magaji Makurdi, a businessman who specialises in supplying farm products to companies. “They later killed him while shooting sporadically inside his compound before they left with his wife, two children and telephone.” The deceased’s son, Bishir Magaji, confirmed the attack to journalists on Wednesday. He said, “I sent a text message to the police that there was an attack in Makurdi community and that my father was killed while my stepmother and two of my siblings were kidnapped by the bandits. But by the time the police arrived, the bandits had completed their operation and left.” He further revealed that the gunmen later freed his sister on Wednesday, adding that his late father’s wife and her baby were still in captivity. Another source revealed that a health worker identified as Dini was also killed. The spokesman for the Katsina State Police Command, Gambo Isah, however claimed nothing of such happened in the community. “There was no any incident of such in Malumfashi, please. I just spoke with DPO,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
