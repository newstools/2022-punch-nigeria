The Accord Party said on Saturday that it would reap from the crises plaguing the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party following their contentious primaries for the June 18 governorship election in Ekiti State. The National Youth Leader of Accord, Abdulrahman Mohammed, who made this known during the party’s primary where its governorship candidate, Reuben Famuyibo, emerged, the party in Ekiti was stepping up door-to-door mobilisation to showcase its candidate and manifesto to shore up its membership base by attracting APC and PDP members. Mohammed said, “Our chances are very clear. You can see that APC and PDP are in trouble. They cannot put their house in order. There will be litigations upon litigation in the two parties because they imposed candidates.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
