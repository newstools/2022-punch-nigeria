No fewer than two Chinese expatriates working at the ongoing Zungeru Hydro Electric Power Dam project in Niger State have been kidnapped. PUNCH Metro gathered that another Chinese national was shot, while two of their security guards were killed when armed kidnappers stormed the site. The incident occurred on Tuesday when the personnel were working on the connection of high tension extension from the dam to Gusase community, in the Shiroro Local Government Area of the state. Our correspondent learnt that the armed men arrived at the construction site on motorcycles and shot sporadically. An eyewitness, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the kidnappers carried sophisticated weapons. He said, “We were shocked with the sudden appearance of the armed kidnappers with their sophisticated weapons; we were confused and did not even know what to do or say.” He revealed that one of the Chinese workers was shot and two of their internal security guards killed, while the kidnappers left with two expatriates. As of the time of filing this report, the actual number of people kidnapped could not be ascertained, as many workers, including the expatriates, were said to have run into the bush. When contacted on the telephone, the Secretary to the Niger State Government, Ibrahim Matane, confirmed the incident. He said, “Yes, I can confirm that the incident actually occurred, but we have yet to get information on the number of people involved and until we get that, we can’t say exactly the number of people involved.” Copyright PUNCH.
