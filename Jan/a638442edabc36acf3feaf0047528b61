A socialite, Obi Iyiegbu, popularly known as Obi Cubana, who chairs the Cubana Group, on Saturday, promised to mentor a young hawker, Ekuma Jeremiah, who was caught on camera in the Ajah area of Lagos last week giving money to persons being transported to prison in a Nigerian Correctional Service van. Cubana disclosed his intention in an Instagram live interview with a broadcaster and radio talk show host, Ifedayo Olarinde, popularly known as Daddy Freeze. He promised to sponsor the boy’s tertiary education in any institution of his choice and also establish him. He said, “Love should be shown in our actions and not just in our words. I want to meet the young boy who, despite being a hawker, gave N100 notes to people in a prison van and was not even aware that he was being filmed by a concerned passerby who was driving on the same road. “Anyone who knows him should connect the boy with Daddy Freeze or me. I want him to go to school in good condition, and I would see him through the university, and if he wants to do his Masters degree abroad, I would also make sure that he is comfortable while going to school because his generosity touched me. “I will do whatever he wants for him, and by God’s grace, when he is done in school, he will get a top-level position at any of my organisations, and if he however finds a higher calling, he is free to do as he pleases. “The most important thing is that I want him to know that he now has a mentor who would guide him through this tough world.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
