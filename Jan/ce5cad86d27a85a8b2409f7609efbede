Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello has invited Lagos-based secondary school student, identified as Mayowa, who drew a portrait of him and has placed him on lifetime scholarship. Mayowa, a secondary school student, had on December 21 2021, drawn and uploaded the artwork depicting governor Bello in northern, southern, and eastern attire, connoting the governor’s “unifier” title. The post made via the Instagram handle, @cridarts, had about 473 views. In the post, the young artist wrote, “I did a painting of Governor Yahaya Bello @officialgybkogi. Please guys, help me tag @officialgybkogi until he sees this.” Receiving the apparently elated artist in Abuja on Wednesday, Bello offered him a lifetime school scholarship. The governor said he is pleased with the creativity and talent of the young man and would be available to see him through in his academics. Bello is known for appreciating creativity and encouraging young people. He is said to be the only governor in Nigeria whose cabinet is made up of over 70% of youths. Copyright PUNCH.
