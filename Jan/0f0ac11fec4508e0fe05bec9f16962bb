The Adamawa State Police Command has apprehended a 57-year-old commercial driver for allegedly stabbing his 40-year-old wife to death. The suspect, Alfa Muhammed, a resident of Lande B village, in the Gombi Local Government Area, reportedly had a disagreement with his wife, Hamsatu, which led to their separation. The wife was said to have relocated to a house close to their residence. While trying to make her new apartment comfortable, she reportedly removed a zinc door of their former house to put in her new abode. Angered by Hamsatu’s action, the suspect allegedly used a knife to stab her in the neck. She was said to have become unconscious and was rushed to a hospital where she was confirmed dead. Alfa was apprehended by policemen from the Gombi divisional headquarters following a complaint filed by the village head of Lande, Babangida Boka. The police said the suspect and the deceased had eight children together before the incident. The spokesman for the Adamawa State Police Command, DSP Suleiman Nguroje, who confirmed the incident in a statement, said the Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Barde, had ordered investigations into it. He said the CP, while ordering the prosecution of the suspect after discreet investigations, advised members of the public against taking the law into their hands. Copyright PUNCH Copyright PUNCH.
