A 17-year old singer, Oboghene Ezaga, aka OB, has said he wrote his first song at the age of six. Revealing how his musical journey began, he told Sunday Scoop, “I grew up in a musically-inclined household. Everyone on my mum’s side as well as my dad sing. A lot of nineties RnB, gospel and soulful music really influenced me. I wrote my first song when I was six years old. I have also been a chorister in school and church. It was as if the fire was lit up in me when I turned 11 and I decided that music was what I wanted to do. I live and breathe music and I feel more comfortable on the piano when I’m singing. I realised that if there was something I needed to do for the rest of my life, it’s music.” On how he manages to combine his education and music career, the student of Psychology at the North Central Texas College, United States of America, said, “I feel they are two things I can do at the same time. Psychology is helping in my music career because I know how people think.” The young singer also noted that he was confident he would do well in the music industry. He said, “Young Nigerians are listening to ‘everything’ these days. Our appetites are expanding so, I believe I will find my people and my people will find me.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
