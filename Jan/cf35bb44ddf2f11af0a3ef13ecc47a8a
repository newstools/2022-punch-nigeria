He said, “The Osun Sector Command will go tough on commercial vehicles without the speed limiting device. “We impounded seven vehicles for violation of the speed limiting device. The total number of vehicles checked between December 29, 2021 and January 1, 2022, is 33. “Seven vehicles out of those ones checked have installed the device. We are embarking on serious enforcement of the speed limiting device to reduce crashes.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
