Egypt captain, Mohamed Salah, says the Pharaohs are under pressure to win the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. The Pharaohs are billed to kick start their AFCON journey against Nigeria at the Roumdé Adjia Stadium, in Garoua on Tuesday (today) but the fans will be hoping the team can claim a record eighth trophy come February 6. Egypt last won the competition in 2010 and the Liverpool frontman believes that the pressure to reclaim the title is enormous but they as players are prepared to take the games one at a time. “We are not the favourites to win the Africa Cup of Nations, but we will do our best to reclaim the title,” Salah said during the pre-match press conference. “I have not won a major championship with my country, and I would like to do that, and I hope that it will be this African Nations Cup. “There is great pressure from the Egyptian public because we are the best in the continent in terms of achieving the title.” Meanwhile, head coach of Egypt, Carlos Queiroz, says they are prepared to play seven games in the competition and hopefully win all of them. “We have a lot of players that are competing among themselves for a starting position, and that’s great because we came here to play seven games. “Our ambition is very simple. Win all the matches.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
