The Public Relations Officer of the Niger State Police Command DSP Wasiu Abiodun has debunked reports that 37 people were killed by terrorists in two communities in the state saying that 13 people were killed. Abiodun who made this refutal in a press statement made available to our correspondent in Minna on Thursday said the figures earlier reported were incorrect. The statement read, “The attention of the command has been drawn to reports that 37 persons were killed in Nakundna and Wurukuchi communities, Shiroro LGA. “The command wishes to state that on 10/01/2022 at about 1000hrs, suspected bandits/terrorists attacked some villagers who were harvesting crops in their farm at Nakundna village near Kaure in Shiroro LGA, and unfortunately, thirteen (13) persons lost their lives as a result of the attack. “Details of the incident were not immediately available due to the rough terrain and lack of communication network in the area.” He assured residents that the police and other security agencies would not relent in the ongoing onslaught against terrorists and other forms of criminality in the state. A resident of one of the communities attacked had said 34 persons were killed out of which 10 were members of the same family while corpses of 24 others were found in bushes. The resident also stated that barns and houses that accommodated over 200 people were burnt down adding that some of the local vigilance group members were also abducted by the terrorists.
