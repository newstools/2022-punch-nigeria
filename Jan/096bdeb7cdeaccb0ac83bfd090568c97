The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said the state’s Blue and Red Lines trains will commence operation this year. Sanwo-Olu said this on Monday while speaking with journalists after a tour round the train project from Ikeja where the Red Line begins to Marina where the Blue Line ended. He said, “Our promise is on course, we believe before the end of this year, we will see trains on top of these tracks. That is our commitment but we will continue to monitor and check ourselves. “In the last three and a half hours we have gone round to see the constructions ongoing between the Red Line and Blue Line. “I am happy to report as you all have seen that the constructions are going on as scheduled. Despite today being a public holiday, the contractors are on sites.” The governor added that the train stations would be at Ebute Meta and Marina and would be soon inaugurated. “At Ebute Meta, there will be an overpass from Muritala Mohammed Road up to Apapa Road. They are launching the columns, the station is far ahead because they have completed the station. “The Marina station is the most iconic for the Blue Line and the beams there will be launched. We have had precast beams stored at the National Art Theatre within six weeks, they should complete the launching,” Sanwo-Olu added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
