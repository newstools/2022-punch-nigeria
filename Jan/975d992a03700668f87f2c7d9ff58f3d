EndSARS campaigner and comedian, Debo Adedayo, professionally known as Mr Macaroni, has lauded the Nigeria Police for helping stranded motorists. A video, that showed the officers changing the tyre of a vehicle that appeared to have developed a fault while in transit, had surfaced online generating different comments. However, Mr Macaroni praised the policemen via his Twitter handle stating that he hoped to see more of such actions in the country. He wrote, “Rare footage of Nigerian Police showing love. Highly commendable. More of this Abeg.” In the video, one of the occupants of the vehicle, who didn’t state his name on camera, said the policemen saw him and his wife in need of help after their car developed a fault. He said they rendered assistance without asking or collecting any monetary or material compensation and asked Nigerians to thank them on their behalf should they ever come in contact with the officers.
