Two minors have been confirmed dead while five others were said to have been injured in an auto crash that occurred along Uyo-Ikot Ekpene Express Way. It was gathered that the accident occurred around Ibiakpan junction in Ikot Ekpene Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State at exactly 8:30 am on Monday. The Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps in the state, Matthew Olonisaye, who confirmed the accident in a statement in Uyo, the state capital, described the incident as unfortunate as it is happening at the beginning of the New Year. The Sector Commander who attributed the accident to wrongful overtaking involving a tipper truck and a motorcycle cautioned road users to always obey traffic regulations. “Drivers should stop abusing the usage of the road by obeying traffic rules and regulations. It’s unfortunate that this happened at the beginning of the new year. We commiserate with the families of the dead children. “Motorcycle riders should be reminded that motorcycles under 50cc are not allowed to ply the highway and should not overtake by the right-hand side of the vehicle. Drivers should not forget that motorcycle riders are human beings, and should not be harassed on the highway,” Olonisaye cautioned. He said seven people in all were involved in the accident including one male and female adult, three male and two female children, adding that one male and female children lost their lives in the carnage. He said the corpses of the deceased have been deposited at the mortuary unit of the Ikot Ekpene General Hospital while those injured are receiving medical treatment at the same facility.
