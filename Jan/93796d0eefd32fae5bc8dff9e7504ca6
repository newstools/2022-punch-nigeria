THE Lagos Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has re-arrested a suspected internet fraudster, Ismailia Mustapha, popularly known as Mompha, for laundering funds obtained through unlawful activities and retention of alleged proceeds of crime. Mompha, who was arrested on Monday, is currently standing trial alongside his company, Ismalob Global Investment Limited, on an amended 22-count charge bordering on cyber fraud and money laundering to the tune of N32.9 bn brought against him by the EFCC. The EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, confirmed this in a statement, titled, ‘EFCC re-arrests Mompha for alleged money laundering.’ Mompha had earlier been arrested by the Nigeria Immigration Service at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport on October 18, 2019, while boarding an Emirates Airline flight to Dubai, following a watchlist by the EFCC. He is alleged to have used his registered companies to receive illicit funds on behalf of cyber fraudsters from across the world in return for commissions. The statement read, “The account of one of his companies, Ismalob Global Investment Limited Bank, a Bureau de Change company, domiciled in Zenith Bank Plc, was allegedly used to launder funds derived from unlawful activities. “Investigation has revealed a fraudulent transfer slip of $92, 412, 75 found in the suspect’s iPhone 8 device. He will soon be charged to court.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
