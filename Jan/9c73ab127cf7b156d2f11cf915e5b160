The Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, has asserted that defections by state governors into the All Progressive Congress do not pose any threat to his presidential ambition in the party. Umahi made this known on Monday during an interview on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily programme monitored by our correspondent. He said, “I will feel happy rather than being threatened. My ambition is in the hand of God. “The more we have governors in the APC, the more chance we have to win the election. The more chance we have to continue the project of Nigeria from where Mr President will leave it by 2023.” It was earlier reported by The PUNCH that Umahi, who doubles as the Chairman of the South-East Governors’ Forum, had informed the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), of his intention to run for President in 2023. Umahi has also been at the forefront of demanding for Igbo Presidency. He explained in the past that one of the reasons he left the Peoples Democratic Party for the APC, was that the PDP did not consider zoning the Presidency to the South-East geopolitical zone.
