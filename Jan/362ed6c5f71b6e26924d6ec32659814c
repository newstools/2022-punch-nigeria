No fewer than two persons were killed and two others injured in a road accident on Tuesday in the Federal Capital Territory. The accident was said to have occurred around 9am in the Idu forest area of the FCT. PUNCH Metro gathered that the accident occurred when a cement truck rammed into two tricycles and a motorcycle. Two persons were said to have died on the spot, while two others who were injured were rushed to the Crown Hospital in Gwagwa. A resident, Johnson Oye, said, “He (truck driver) came to supply cement to those building houses here.  We can’t say if he actually lost control or was trying to overtake them; we just saw that the truck had knocked down two tricycles and a motorcycle. “The motorcyclist suffered a high degree of injury and was taken to the Crown Hospital. The other two that died were in one of the tricycles. The truck driver did not wait after hitting them; he was ready to crush anybody that stood in his way.” One of the survivors, who gave her name as Alimat, said she was going to get drugs for her sick child when she was involved in the crash. She said, “The rider of the motorcycle I boarded sustained serious injuries.” The FCT Federal Road Safety Corps Sector Commander, Samuel Ochi, said he was not aware of the accident. Copyright PUNCH.
