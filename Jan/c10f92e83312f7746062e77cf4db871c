The Nigerian Army has said troops, in conjunction with other security agencies, have dislodged a notorious stronghold of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra and its armed affiliate, Eastern Security Network, at Lilu Forest in Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State. Director Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday. Nwachukwu said Lilu, a border town between Imo and Anambra states, was hitherto known to be used as an operational base of the dissidents. He said the operation, which was conducted in the early hours of Monday, led to the neutralisation of some gunmen in a firefight that ensued. “After dislodging the dissidents from their fortress, the dogged troops recovered 10 pump action shotguns, two locally fabricated guns, one revolver pistol, rounds of 7.62 mm special, live cartridges, machetes and IPOB flags. Other items recovered are mobile phones, laptops and other dangerous weapons. “The operation was jointly conducted by troops of 82 Division, Nigerian Navy, 211 Quick Response Group of the Nigerian Air Force, Department of State Services and the Nigeria Police. It was a well-coordinated dawn attack on the fortress, where plans were been perfected to violently enforce the illegitimate sit-at-home declaration by the irredentist groups.” Copyright PUNCH.
