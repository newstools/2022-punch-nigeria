A former presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections, Isaac Ositelu, has urged Nigerians not to lose hope in the transformation of the country to a greater nation. Ositelu, who spoke against the backdrop of the current economic challenges, insecurity and political crises, said the country would surmount its present challenges and emerge stronger. In a statement titled, ‘2023 Presidential Elections: Ositelu Unveils Recipe for Good Governance, Democratic Dividends,’ he urged Nigerians to put behind them the disappointments of their recent political experiences and get prepared for the transition in 2023. According to him, the citizens have pivotal roles to play in getting Nigeria back on track as a nation to earn global respect and honour. Ositelu said that the citizens must be actively involved in the decision-making processes by registering and obtaining their permanent voter card, protecting it jealously and ensuring that their future is not mortgaged through fraudulent disenfranchisement by politicians “who will offer peanuts in exchange for their PVC for electoral frauds”. “The astute political tactician called on the youth and women to take their pride of place in the political terrain by making their numbers count. He said that the Youths and Women should no longer accept to be willing tools in the hands of incredible politicians whose only interest is to use and dump them. “He called on the Youths and Women to play more active and leadership roles in the governance structures at the local government, state and federal levels in Nigeria. He said that the Civil Society Organisations, Independent National Electoral Commission, the political parties and other stakeholders in the electoral processes must heighten the public enlightenment campaigns on the virtues of citizens’ active and positive involvement in the election of leaders that would serve the overall good interest of the country and its citizens,” the statement added.
