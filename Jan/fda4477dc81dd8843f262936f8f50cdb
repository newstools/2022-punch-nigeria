The Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has granted amnesty to 10 inmates of the Nigeria Correction Service centres in the state. Four of those pardoned were freed totally while the remaining six, who had earlier been sentenced to death, had their sentence commuted to life imprisonment. It was gathered that the governor’s action was to mark the 2022 new year celebration. This was contained in a statement issued by the state Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Charles Titiloye, on Saturday. The statement read, “The Governor of Ondo State, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, SAN has ordered the immediate release from correctional centres in the state four (4) inmates serving various terms of imprisonment to mark 2022 New year celebration. “The release of the inmate was in exercise of the power conferred on Mr Governor by paragraph (a) (c) and (d) of subsection (1) of section 212 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended). The inmates were released based on report of good conduct at the correctional centres. “The governor also commuted to life imprisonment the sentence of six (6) condemned inmates who were sentenced to death by hanging by courts in the state. Mr Governor extended his grace and mercy to another inmate sentenced to Life Imprisonment. He is now to spend 15 years at the correctional centre. “The governor urged the released inmates to see their release as another opportunity to live a good life as better and reformed citizens. He urged the members of the public to accommodate and reintegrate them and not to discriminate against them.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
