Two persons have been killed by suspected herders in Igama community, in Ojugo ward of the Okpokwu Local government Area of Benue State. A resident who did not want to be mentioned said the suspects had continued to invade communities in the area in the last two weeks. The resident said the latest attack occurred on Tuesday evening where two persons, including a woman, were killed and several houses burnt. The suspected herders were said to have shot indiscriminately on entering the community. Confirming the attacks on Saturday, the Chairman of Okpokwu LGA, Mrs Amina Audu, said the attackers killed people without provocation. “Fulani herdsmen came and attacked the community and burnt houses and a woman was later found dead a few days after,” Audu said. She, however, said the incident was reported to the police while men of the Livestock Guards were sent to the area. “They have attacked the community for three consecutive times since January 13, 2022. They would just come into the community and attack them (residents). They normally come in the afternoon. We did not record a lot of casualties because security agents were deployed to the area,” Audu said. When contacted, the Benue State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Catherine Anene, said she had not received any information about the incident. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
