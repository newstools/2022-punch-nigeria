An eight-year-old author, Mofifunoluwa Atilola, has appealed to government and other stakeholders in the education sector to help children discover and nurture their talents. Speaking at the public presentation of her book, titled, ‘Eleana in the woods,’ which took place at the Nike Art Gallery, Lekki, Lagos, said if she could write, children of her age too should make endeavour to do so. Atilola who plays the basketball and piano skilfully encouraged her mates to make effort to write story books, saying her parents motivated her to write. She said, “My parents motivated me.I can write so they can write a book too. Parents should motivate the children in case they need help. I started step by steps by writing cinderalla stories. This is my first short story. “Children can do other sports, develop their talents in music and other skills if they put their mind to it. Government of Nigeria should help other Nigerians to learn other types of things.” Her father, Mr Shina Atilola, said, “During the holidays I feel she needed to improve on her writing and through a colleague I presented for a writing training, I didn’t know she will come out the best in her age category, and the organisers said they wanted to publish her short story which they did. She wrote the story before she turned six but due to COVID-19, we couldn’t publish it. As parents, have a lot to do, our learning starts when we give birth to them, we need to understand them better, discover their talents, create platform for them to excel, we should help them discover what they want and we shouldn’t influence them on what we they prefer.” Copyright PUNCH.
