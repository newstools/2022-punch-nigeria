The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Mai Mala Buni, has said the Buhari-led regime is bridging the gender gap by its appointment of Margery Okadigbo as Chairperson and other women to the board of the newly-incorporated Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited. Buni also congratulated the entire NNPC Ltd. board and management describing the appointees as truly deserving, progressive, eminent and experienced. This is according to a statement signed on Friday by the APC Women Representative, Stella Oketete, titled ‘APC Congratulates Okadigbo, NNPC Board, Management on Appointments’. According to Oketete, “On behalf of the National Chairman, APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, and entire supporters and members of the APC, I congratulate Senator Margery Okadigbo on her appointment as Chairman of the newly-incorporated Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited. “Commendably, President Muhammadu Buhari has again matched words with action in bridging the gender leadership gap by appointing Senator Margery Okadigbo among other deserving women into positions of leadership. Nigerian women are truly grateful.” The APC also described other members of the Board and management as “truly deserving, progressive, eminent and experienced,” adding that their appointment will further boost the regime’s landmark reforms in the country’s oil sector. “As Senator Margery Okadigbo assumes duty at the NNPC as Board Chairman, we are confident she will alongside her team bring their vast experience and contacts to bear on her important assignment,” the APC said.
