Former staff members of Wema Bank Plc in Nigeria and in the diaspora will converge on Lagos next month for a first reunion aimed at fostering social interaction and welfare of the over 300 members. According to a statement signed by the Chairman of Group Admin Team, Wale Adedapo, the event is slated to hold under the aegis of Wema Bank Ex-Colleagues Group in Ikeja. Adedapo said the reunion would explore the best possible means to empower members who had served the bank meritoriously in the past. The Chairman Titan Trust Bank, Mr Tunde Lemo, a former deputy governor of Central Bank of Nigeria and former Managing Director, Wema Bank, will be the special guest speaker at the event, according to the statement. “The current Managing Director of Wema Bank Plc, Mr Ademola Adebise, is also billed to attend the reunion as the special guest of honour, an attempt by the group to forge a closer tie with the contemporary Wema brand,” it said.
