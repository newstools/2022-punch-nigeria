The Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria has said teachers, who fail to register with it, will not benefit from the implementation of the elongation of service years and new salary scale. The Registrar, TRCN, Prof Josiah Ajiboye, disclosed this in an interview with The PUNCH in Abuja. He also spoke on the efforts of the council to clamp down on illegal teachers in the country. The PUNCH reports that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had promised that teachers in Nigeria would have the opportunity of having their service years extended from 30 to 35. This is as the president also promised to start the implementation of the new salary scale for teachers by January 2022. A circular obtained from the Ministry of Defence addressed to schools under it also stated that teachers, who retired in December 2021 but applied for the elongation of service, should stay back at their duty posts pending the time when all necessary documentation would be completed. The TRCN registrar, however, explained to our correspondent that part of the requirements would be the council’s licence. He said, “A major part of the requirements is the TRCN licence and certificate. That is the licence that allows you to teach in this country. If you do not have your TRCN licence and your certificate, there is no way you can benefit from the packages. “They must present those two because that is the only way we can verify that they are real teachers. Those without the certificates are not even supposed to be engaged as teachers. The TRCN, as the regulatory council, is also committed to flushing out the menace of fake teachers from our society.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
