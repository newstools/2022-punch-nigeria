The Yoruba World Centre has commenced plans towards the preservation of Yoruba language and culture through the media. The coordinator of YWC, Mr Alao Adedayo, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday. He said, “From this week, we shall visit all broadcasting stations in the South-West, one after the other. We want to know all they have been doing towards the preservation and promotion of Yoruba language and culture, and to suggest what other steps the YWC thinks should be taken. “The aim is to come together, all of us, to save our language and culture, and the time is now. It is also to remind ourselves that the survival of the language is also the survival of those media that use the language to get to their audience.” Adedayo added that the YWC will collaborate with all stakeholders, including Nollywood. “The YWC plans an immediate collaborative move with all stakeholders, especially the broadcast media, Egbe Akomolede (Yoruba Teachers Association) and the Nollywood, whose major language of communication is Yoruba,” he said.
