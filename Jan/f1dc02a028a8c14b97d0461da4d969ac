Hollywood actor, John Stamos on Tuesday, mourned his fellow Full House actor and comedian, Bob Saget, who was found dead in his Florida hotel room. Taking to his Instagram page, Stamos said he was not ready to accept that Saget has died, as he recalled how they met on the location of Full House thirty-five years ago. He wrote, “I’m not ready to accept that he’s gone – I’m not going to say goodbye yet. I’m going to imagine him out there, still on the road, doing what he loves with all his heart and humor. He’s standing on stage, killing! “Another two-hour set in front of a couple hundred of the luckiest people on the planet. They’re laughing so hard, they weep. “On his way to the hotel, he calls his beautiful, loving wife, Kelly. He says he feels 26 again, alive! Then asks her to fix up a picture he wants to post. She tells him it doesn’t need fixing, and tells him how handsome he is. He tells her he loves her with every bit of his heart. “And when he gets to the hotel to put his head on the pillow, he misses his daughters, his family, his friends. God, he loves us all so much. And he goes to sleep dreaming of when we’ll all meet again – and he’s smiling. “I know in my heart he’s smiling, still hearing the laughter from a few hours before. I’m just not ready to say goodbye yet. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
