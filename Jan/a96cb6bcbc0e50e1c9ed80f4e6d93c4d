Boat owners plying the Calabar/Oron route have cried out over insecurity on the Calabar waterways despite allegedly paying N5,000 daily for security. A boat owner, who pleaded not to be named, disclosed this to journalists in Calabar, Cross River State, while confirming that a boat conveying passengers from Calabar to Oron was hijacked on Monday. According to him, pirate attacks have been occurring on the waters since 2014. An attack, he said, occurred in December last year and one of the abducted passengers allegedly paid N250, 000 before regaining freedom. He also disclosed that while the passengers are usually released, the pirates are after the engine of the boats which cost over N2.5 million for a second hand engine. He appealed to the government to come to their aid. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo, said he was not sure of the incident. She said, “I called our Officer-in-Charge, Marine Division and he said that’s what he heard and nobody has come to report to the police. “The union leader in charge is supposed to come and report but nevertheless we are on the matter. “The area is being combed and our men are on the ground, nobody has come to complain but we are still on it.” Copyright PUNCH.
