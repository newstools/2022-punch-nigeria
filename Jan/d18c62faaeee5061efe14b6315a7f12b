The Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in Ogun State, Sikirullahi Ogundele, on Thursday, said “there is no faction anywhere in the state chapter of the party.” Ogundele said this following the successful harmonisation of all blocs of interest in the party since March 2021. Ogundele while reacting to the move by another faction in the state said the party has been enjoying a “crisis-free, stable and harmonious working relationship” in the state. The new faction led by Semiu Sobayo emerged on Wednesday in Abeokuta, the state capital. The faction at Ogun Senatorial District stakeholders’ meeting, held in Abeokuta, the State capital, declared Sobayo as the authentic chairman of the party in the state. The meeting, which was attended by some members of the SouthWest Executive, including zonal Treasurer, Omotoyosi Ogunse; zonal Ex-officio, Gbenga Idowu; zonal legal adviser, Barr. Mosuru Olakupoyi and a governorship aspirant, Hon. Segun Showunmi, passed a vote of confidence in the national chairman of the party, Iyorcha Ayu. Ogundele – led PDP is recognised by the National Working Committee of the party. According to him, PDP is a political assemblage of “experienced, rich and disciplined minds that cannot afford to close its doors against anyone.” Ogundele added that “the state chapter of the party under my chairmanship has been discharging its duties as the main opposition party in the state independently without any form of influence or interference from any individual or group of people. “As we look up to the next rounds of political activities, I appeal to all well-meaning members of the public to rise in patriotic partnership with our party in the collective desire to rescue our dear Ogun State from the unpardonable maladministration as manifestly exhibited by the ruling APC government.”
