The Governor-elect of Anambra State, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, has commiserated with the victims of the fire incident at the Obodo Ukwu end of the Onitsha-Owerri Road in Onitsha. The fire occurred early on Friday following a petrol tanker explosion on the road which razed buildings and shops in the market around the scene. A statement on Saturday by Soludo’s media aide, Joe Anatune, said the incoming governor expressed deep sorrow at the magnitude of material losses suffered by the victims. He lamented the incessant tanker explosions in the Onitsha axis and other cities around the country. He assured that a lasting solution to prevent future occurrences would be fashioned out to safeguard precious lives and material losses in future, saying this current trend cannot continue
Soludo commended President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Willie Obiano for their immediate reactions and condolences to the victims. He, therefore, called on relevant government institutions saddled with the responsibilities of providing succour for cases of this nature to provide the needed relief and support to ameliorate the losses, pains and agonies suffered by the victims arising from the unfortunate incident. He commended the gallantry of the youths, fire service officials and other security personnel who came immediately to the scene to stem the spread of the inferno. “We prayed to God to console all the affected victims while also calling for assistance from public-spirited individuals and corporate organisations for the victims,” he added.
