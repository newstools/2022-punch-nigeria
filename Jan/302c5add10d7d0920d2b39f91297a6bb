The Outdoor Advertising Association of Nigeria has decorated the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, and the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, as its national patrons. The association’s President, Mr Emmanuel Ajufo, in a statement on Sunday, said the appointment of the traditional rulers was in recognition of the fact that as custodians of the traditions and cultures of the nation, they occupied a pedestal that positioned them as formidable rallying point, for peace and national unity. “OAAN members hold the kings in high esteem and will henceforth be looking on to them as fathers in the hope of getting fatherly guidance from them on every issue of concern. The decision to honour the traditional rulers was influenced by the Association’s conviction that such a step will ultimately be in the best interest of OAAN and the practice of Outdoor Advertising in the country. “The emergence of the first class traditional rulers as national patrons for OAAN is because the out-of-home business is routed in every area of the country and there is the need to give members who are in various parts of the country sense of belonging. Therefore, it is in demonstration of our high regard for the traditions and cultures of Nigeria that we are identifying with those that are custodians of those values,” Ajufo said. The decorations, according to the statement took place recently at the palaces of the two traditional personalities. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
