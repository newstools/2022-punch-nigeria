The Head of Civil Service of the Federation, Folashade Yemi-Esan, has called on labour and trade unions to embrace the principles of collective bargaining and mutual respect for the promotion of national interests. This was disclosed in a statement issued on her behalf by Akinwunmi Taiwo of the OHCSF and made available to Saturday PUNCH on Friday. Yemi-Esan was said to have spoken at a meeting of the National Public Service Negotiating Councils which serves as an interface between the Government and the labour/ trade unions. According to Yemi-Esan, there cannot be meaningful development in any country where the grievances of workers who are the drivers of development are ignored. She said, “Organised labour has the critical role of evolving and inculcating new principles of industrial relations that would promote collaboration and advance institutional strategic thinking. “This is with the objective of sustaining industrial peace and harmony in the public service for improved productivity especially in the face of current global realities and circumstances.” Copyright PUNCH.
