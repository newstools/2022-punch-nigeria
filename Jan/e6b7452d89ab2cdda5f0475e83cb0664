Turkish footballer Ahmet Calik has tragically died in a car crash. The 27-year-old, who played eight times for his national team and most recently turned out for club Konyaspor, was involved in the collision on Tuesday morning in the capital city of Ankara. Calik also played for Super Lig giants Galatasaray after spending his early years with Genclerbirligi. Reports from Turkey say that the incident occurred around 9am in the Hacilar District of Golbasi. The defender’s car is said to have gone out of control on the Ankara-Nigde motorway before overturning. Calik was alone in the vehicle, Mirror UK reports. In a statement, Konyaspor said, “We are deeply saddened by the loss of our football player Ahmet Calik, who has won the love of our fans and our city since the first day he came to Konyaspor. “Condolences to all of us, especially to the family of our football player Ahmet Calik.” Copyright PUNCH.
