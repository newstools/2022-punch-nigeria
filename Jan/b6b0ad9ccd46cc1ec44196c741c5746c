Barely a week after terrorists killed over 40 members of a vigilante group n Gassol Local Government Area of Taraba State, suspected terrorists have again killed three persons in an attack on Wuro Bokki village in the same local government. It was gathered that the terrorists, numbering about 12, attacked the village at about 5.30pm Saturday. A resident, Nasiru Adamu, told our correspondent on the telephone that those killed were all relations of the village head. Another resident of the area, Bello Dauda, told journalists that the entire area has been taken over by terrorists who hide under the guise of cattle rearing to commit crimes, including kidnapping and cattle rustling. “We are Fulani herdsmen, but not the type of Fulani bandits that came into this area from Zamfara State and are committing crimes,” Dauda said. The state police command’s Public Relations Officer, Abdullahi Usman, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, confirmed the attack but said two persons were killed. “Yes, there was an attack on Wuro Bokki village in Gassol Local Government Area and two persons were killed. “Normalcy has returned to the area and the command has deployed personnel to the area to boost security and give people confidence,” he said.
