Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has berated the leaders and people of Ogoni ethnic nationality for promoting disunity among themselves, while blaming the backwardness of their area on others. Wike stated this at the 30th celebration of Ogoni Day with the theme, “Leaving no one behind”, held at the Birabi Memorial Grammar School, Bori town in Khana Local Government Area of Rivers State on Tuesday. The governor queried how many Ogoni leaders can truly defend the interest of Ogoni land, and genuinely pursue issues of environmental degradation and resource control with the same zest demonstrated by their forebears like late Ken Saro-Wiwa, without selling out. He said “People like Ken Saro-Wiwa and all of the people you are celebrating on Ogoni Day, how many of you can today stand for what Ken (Saro-Wiwa) stood for? “How many can today stand for the great Ogoni men who died for your struggle?” He regretted how some Ogoni people have now debased the struggle and have rather used it to collect money from those who do not want the goals of the struggle achieved. The governor said such monetary gains they make can best be described as blood money and wondered with what conscience that they gather each year to celebrate a struggle that they have betrayed. “You use Ogoni Day to make money. God will never forgive you. I will never be at a party to make blood money. All of you, you are here today for Ogoni Day, are you standing firm for Ogoni people? Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
