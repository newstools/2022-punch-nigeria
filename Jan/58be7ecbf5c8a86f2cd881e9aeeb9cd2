The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has taken into custody a former Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in Lagos State, Mr Olasupo Shasore, SAN. Sashore is being grilled by EFCC operatives over his roles in the Process & Industrial Development scam. He had earlier been questioned by the anti-agency over the allegations against him. A competent source disclosed that the senior lawyer arrived at the commission’s  headquarters in Abuja on Tuesday afternoon and was  questioned for several hours. Sashore was alleged to have bungled the case filed against P&ID in London despite being paid a $2 million professional fee by the Federal Government. Reports said he was appointed as counsel for Nigeria in the arbitration leading to the legal tussle on account of his legal expertise and  position as a former president of the Lagos Court of Arbitration. Shasore was said to have been paid $2mn to assist in the first and second stages of the arbitration. But investigation by the EFCC later revealed that Shasore did not give his best to defend the country’s interest but rather kept pushing for settlement, suggesting that he was compromised. Giving an update on the latest developments,  a source said, “Sashore is still been questioned over his roles in the P&ID scam following new evidence uncovered by investigators. He will spend the night in our custody.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
