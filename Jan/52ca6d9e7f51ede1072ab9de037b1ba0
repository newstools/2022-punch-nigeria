The National Universities Commission has described as a challenge the outflux of Nigerian students to foreign countries for university education. The tertiary education regulatory body made this known in its latest weekly bulletin, which was made available to The PUNCH in Abuja, on Sunday. The commission, however, added that it would continue to leverage on its statutory mandates to ensure the orderly development of the university system in Nigeria. The publication read in part, “The recent outflux of Nigerian students to foreign countries for university education, which in most cases, such qualifications are being obtained from unaccredited institutions, has become a major challenge to the Nigerian university system. “The commission, in performing its statutory regulatory functions of ensuring the orderly development of the NUC, has continued to ensure and maintain quality and standards in university education. “As the activities of the commission have been progressively expanding in a bid to effectively meet emerging trends in higher education, it has equally led to the phenomenal growth of the university system in Nigeria. “On the way forward, Prof Abubakar Rasheed (NUC Registrar) reassured all that the NUC will continue to leverage on statutory mandates to ensure orderly development of the university system in Nigeria.” Copyright PUNCH.
