Nigerian songstress, Omawumi Megbele, and her husband, Tosin Yussuf, marked their fourth wedding anniversary on Thursday. The singer took to her Instagram page to share a picture from the ceremony, as she wished her husband a happy ‘tradiversary.’ She wrote, “Today four years ago! Happy Tradiversary(sic), my husband.” In an interview late last year, the singer had revealed that her husband has a huge influence on her music because she either expresses love to him or abuses him (playfully) with her songs. She said, “My husband plays a large role in influencing my music. I use my music to express love to him; sometimes, I use my music to abuse him. “And he will be like ‘Can you just sing about something else?’ Outside of that, I make sure my family is totally separate from my work.” Copyright PUNCH.
