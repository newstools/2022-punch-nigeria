The round of 16 stage of 2021/2022 Copa del Rey will feature a repeat of last season’s final, as FC Barcelona were drawn against Athletic Bilbao.
A Seville derby is also on the cards. Barca faced Athletic Bilbao in April of last year, winning 4-0 in the showdown at La Cartuja in Seville, with Lionel Messi scoring twice. He helped the Blaugrana to their only trophy of a disappointing season, and his last piece of silverware at the club. That defeat was the second in a Copa del Rey final in the space of two weeks for Athletic Bilbao, with the club having gone down 1-0 to their Basque rivals Real Sociedad in the delayed 2019/2020 final. Holders Barca scraped past Linares Deportivo 2-1 to reach the last 16 this time around. The other headline tie sees a clash between Seville’s two clubs — Real Betis and Sevilla — while Real Sociedad host Atletico Madrid in another all LaLiga encounter. Real Madrid, meanwhile, will face a trip to Elche. It means Los Blancos will face Elche twice in the space of a week, with Real Madrid hosting the team from the east of Spain at Santiago Bernabeu in a league fixture on Jan. 23. These ties will take place in the week commencing Jan. 17. Asked on Friday if he believed his side had been given an easier draw compared to Barca and Atletic Bilbao, Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti replied: “Well, no. All the teams want to perform well. “It will be a tough match we need to prepare for properly as we’ll play away against Elche. For me, it’s just a draw and we just need to be focused and prepared as the Copa del Rey is an important competition for us obviously.” Copa del Rey last 16 draw in full: Atletico Baleares vs Valencia
