Two people have died and many abducted following terrorists’ invasion of Tungan Bako and Kawo communities in the Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State. A resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told our correspondent that the terrorists demanded a ransom of N70m for the victims. It was gathered that the attacks, which occurred on Thursday night, made villagers in the two communities flee. The source said, “They called us that we should pay N70m as ransom before those abducted would be released. The situation is serious and villagers are fleeing the communities.’’ According to the source, the terrorists, riding over 30 motorcycles with two armed men on each, attacked the communities at about 11pm. Another eyewitness, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said, “Two people were shot while trying to escape into the bush. The operation lasted till about 3.30am on Friday morning without any help for the villagers from anywhere. The assailants left only when they satisfied themselves.’’ It was further gathered that a pregnant woman and her two-year-old son were among those abducted but the woman was later released while the son was taken away. The police spokesperson in the state, Wasiu Abiodun, could not be reached for comments. Calls made to his mobile were unanswered as of the time this report was filed.  Copyright PUNCH.
