Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has extended the Light-up Edo Project to Auchi and other areas in the northern part of the state. As a result, the state government has installed 283 solar streetlights at strategic locations on the major roads linking the towns in the northern part of Edo State. A statement quoted the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Energy and Electricity, Edo State, Stephen Uyiekpen,  as saying, “The Light-up Edo Project is part of the governor’s plan to transform the state into the preferred business destination in Nigeria, improve security and raise the standards of living of residents.” Uyiekpen said that “the solar streetlight project covers the ever-busy Auchi-Jattu road and the Jattu-Otaru Polytechnic Road.” He added, “The Jattu-Otaru Polytechnic Road has 105 solar streetlights installed (about 3.3km) starting from the polytechnic gate, while the Auchi-Jattu Township Road (about 4.9km) has a total of 178 solar street lights installed.” Copyright PUNCH.
