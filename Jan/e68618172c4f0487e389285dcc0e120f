The Governor of Yobe state and Chairman of the All Progressives Congress Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Mai Mala Buni, has denied reports claiming that the party will review the party’s congresses in Gombe State. This is as he warned proponents of the report against sabotaging the reconciliation process between the state governor, Muhammadu Yahaya; and former Governor Danjuma Goje. The governor’s Director-General, Press and Media Affairs, Mamman Mohammed, disclosed this in a statement released on Monday evening. In the statement titled ‘Gov Buni warns against sabotaging Gombe reconciliation,’ the APC leader said he has at no time, said or directed anyone to state on his behalf or the party, anything pertaining the said review. The statement read, “The report is a baseless speculation and a figment of the author’s imagination that does not reflect in any way the position of the party. “It is pertinent to note that, we have gone a long way in reconciling the two prominent members of the party in person of the Governor of Gombe State, Alhaji Muhammadu Yahaya; and his brother, Senator Danjuma Goje. “We condemn in strong terms any action deliberately concocted to sabotage the new peace and true reconciliation among these critical stakeholders of the party.” Copyright PUNCH.
