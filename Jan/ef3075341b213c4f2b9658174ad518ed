Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in Lagos State have arrested one Michael Jackson for his alleged involvement in Internet fraud. The suspect was arrested on Tuesday, according to a statement on Wednesday by the anti-graft agency. The statement titled, ‘EFCC Arrests Suspected Internet Fraudster in Lagos’, said Jackson was apprehended following “credible intelligence received by the Commission on the illegal activities of some individuals allegedly involved in computer-related fraud”. The statement added, “Jackson, who poses as Ella, a transgender woman, allegedly defrauded unsuspecting victims of millions of Naira. “The suspect, who also claimed to be a Disc Jockey, DJ, had in his possession fetish items, which he claimed was ‘for grace and success’.” The EFCC had last year said Lagos, particularly Lekki, the fast-developing upper-middle-class area of the state, is emerging as the new hub of Internet scammers with over 402 suspected Internet fraudsters arrested in the area between April and June 2021.
