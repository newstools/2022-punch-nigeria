Edo State Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, has described Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) as the best candidate for the 2023 Presidency, declaring that the whole of Edo is with him. Shaibu made the declaration on Saturday while speaking at the installation of the Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Clem Agba, as the Odumha of Auchi at the Otaru of Auchi Palace. The Vice President was the Special Guest of Honour at the occasion. “Your Excellency, just know that you have Edo, you have us, anything that you want to do, you have us and you have God. And by the Grace of God, we will have our own as the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria come 2023,” the Edo deputy governor said. Shaibu thanked the VP for taking time from his busy schedule to be in Auchi, adding that “by the grace of God, the young men and youths, we will mobilise ourselves so that we can take our destiny in our hands. The EndSARS was a clarion call to all of us.” He then noted that “the era of godfathers are over, it is now the era of good leadership and progressive leadership. Men that have intellect, men that will turn our state into an industrial state so that those who are unemployed will be gainfully employed.” Though many aspirants from the two leading political parties – the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party – have been declaring interest to run, the VP has not declared whether he would be running or not but his supporters have been urging him to join the race.
