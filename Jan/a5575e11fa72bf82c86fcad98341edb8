Napoli striker Victor Osimhen has congratulated the Super Eagles of Nigeria after their victory against Egypt. Nigeria defeated The Pharaohs for the first time in an opening fixture of the African Cup of Nations after losing in the 1963 and 2010 editions. Osimhen, who was unsure of his participation due to an injury he sustained in a match against Juventus, was eventually dropped from the squad after Napoli revealed that he had contracted the COVID-19 virus. The former Lille striker took to his Twitter handle to congratulate his teammates, urging them to keep the momentum through the course of the tournament. “Congratulations guys, amazing performance. We continue to build on this momentum,” he wrote. Osimhen played a pivotal role in Nigeria’s qualification for the postponed 2021 AFCON under former Technical Adviser, Gernot Rohr. Copyright PUNCH.
