Some chieftains of the All Progressives Congress in Oyo State have called for fervent prayers to an end to the spate of deaths in the state. They made the calls in separate statements on Friday in Ibadan following the sudden death in the UK of Angela, wife of Teslim Folarin, a senator representing Oyo Central. In a statement obtained by the News Agency of Nigeria, which he personally signed, Chief Sharafadeen Alli, an APC chieftain, expressed shock over the death and described the deceased as a woman of virtue, who supported her husband in his political and humanitarian endeavours. He called for prayers over the death of prominent people in Nigeria and Oyo State in particular. The senior Ibadan chief and former Secretary to the State Government condoled with Angela’s immediate family, particularly her husband and the entire Ibadanland. He said that Angela, a lawyer, died at a time her husband needed her support and urged the widower to consider and accept her death as the will of God. Also, Dr Olusola Ayandele, a renowned businessman and APC chieftain, commiserated with Folarin over the wife’s death. Ayandele, in a statement, said he received the news of Angela’s death as a rude shock, describing it as sad and devastating. He said that the deceased was a virtuous woman and great pillar of support for her husband, saying her death was a huge loss. The Ibarapa-born politician said the death of prominent people across the state in recent times called for fervent prayers.
