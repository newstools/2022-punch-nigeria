To further spice the bubbling social landscape of Lagos, a new event centre is set to open in Ikeja. Called Highpoint Event Centre and Suites, it is expected to make an impact in the hospitality sector in Lagos State as it offers a one-stop-shop desired by most event planners and hosts. In an interview with Merrymakers, the owner of the facility, Omolara Adebiyi, said, “The event centre is equipped with a top-class sound system, CCTV cameras, A-grade stage lights, eye-catching chandeliers and interior decor that will leave guests stunned with a satisfying feeling of value for their money. There are also three standby generators to ensure that our guests enjoy uninterrupted power supply while they party hard. The event centre also comes with a luxurious 20-room lounge, including a two-room VIP lounge and 18 single rooms that will make guests feel at home away from home.”  Copyright PUNCH.
