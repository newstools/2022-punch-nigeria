The Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry, Enugu, Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka, said on Sunday that it had received another invitation from the Department of State Services. Operatives of the DSS had in June 2021 visited the Adoration ground to deliver a letter of invitation to Mbaka. Mbaka raised the alarm on Sunday that his life was no longer safe, saying an anonymous person brought another invitation to him for interrogation by the DSS. He had earlier hinted about the invitation from the DSS in his New Year message during the crossover night service at the Adoration Ground, Emene, Enugu. Mbaka pleaded with his followers to intensify prayers for him over the fresh travail, saying he did not do anything wrong to warrant the hunt. “Anonymous brought a letter here inviting me to the DSS last year. Now, another anonymous has brought another letter from the DSS. Please, you must keep praying for Fr Mbaka,” he said. He described his Adoration Ministry as an answer to the prayers of the church over the years. He said, “If the Pope sees what is going on here, he will go to any length to protect it. Forget about what people are saying. Mbaka may not be the best, but God is using him to glorify his name. “Look at the hundreds of thousands of people who are gathered here just to worship God in the Catholic Church. Anyone who is working against this kind of gathering must be a Satan incarnate. That person must be doing a special work for the devil.” Copyright PUNCH Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
