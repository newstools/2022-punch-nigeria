Super Eagles defender, Chidozie Awaziem, faces a race to be fit for Wednesday’s Group D clash against Guinea Bissau, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The Alanyaspor defender is yet to make an appearance at the ongoing tournament after sustaining an ankle injury in training prior to the start of the tournament. The 25-year-old has been cleared by the Eagles medical team and trained with the squad on Tuesday night, but the game versus the Djurtus may come too soon for the former Porto defender. “Awaziem was a bit ill and he is okay now,” Eguavoen said during the pre-match conference on Tuesday. “Also the sprain on his ankle has also been taken care of.  But it’s a bit difficult if he will be available for selection, but we will see.” Awaziem, who is making his second appearance at the AFCON, has scored once in 26 appearances for the Eagles since he made his debut in the 2-0 loss to South Africa in 2017 at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium, Uyo.
