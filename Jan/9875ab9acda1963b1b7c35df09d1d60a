The number of workers with pension accounts under the Contributory Pension Scheme rose by 245,385 in nine months to 9,461,173. The latest data obtained from the National Pension Commission on ‘Total RSA registrations as at 30 September 2021’ showed the number of pension contributors stood at 9,215,788 as of December 2020.

While showing the Pension Fund Administrators’ market share by RSA registration, the commission said the ranking of PFAs by the number of registered contributors as of the end of Q2 2021 showed that there was an increase in the market share of the bottom three PFAs from 1.60 per cent in Q1 to 4.5 per cent in Q2.
