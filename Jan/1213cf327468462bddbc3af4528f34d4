The Nigerian Army, on Tuesday, said its troops, in a joint operation with other security agencies, dislodged the stronghold of the Indigenous People of Biafra and its armed affiliate, Eastern Security Network, in Lilu Forest, in the Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State. An undisclosed number of IPOB members were said to have been neutralised, while their weapons, including guns, cutlasses and Biafra flags, were recovered. A statement by the Director of Army Public Relations, Brig-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, said the operation was carried out in the early hours of Monday, January 17, 2022. He said Lilu, a border town between Imo and Anambra states, was hitherto used as an operational base of the dissidents. The statement partly read, “After dislodging the dissidents from their fortress, the dogged troops recovered 10 pump-action shotguns, two locally-fabricated guns, one revolver pistol, rounds of 7.62 mm special, live cartridges, machetes and IPOB flags. Other items recovered are mobile phones, laptops, among other weapons. “The operation was jointly conducted by troops of the 82 Division, Nigerian Navy, 211 Quick Response Group of the Nigerian Air Force, Department of State Services and the Nigeria Police. It was a well-coordinated dawn attack on the fortress, where plans were being perfected to violently enforce the illegitimate sit-at-home declaration by the irredentist group.” Copyright PUNCH.
