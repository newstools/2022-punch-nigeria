About five gunmen on Wednesday afternoon invaded the flyover at Aroma Junction, Awka, Anambra State and killed a young man. Our correspondent gathered that the gunmen intercepted the young man, whose identity is yet to be ascertained as of the time of filing this report, under the Aroma flyover, pursued him and shot him severally on the head. An eyewitness account said the gunmen ensured that the young man was dead before leaving the scene. When our correspondent visited the scene, he gathered that the victim was sitting under the flyover bridge a few minutes before the attackers located and killed him. Another eyewitness, identified as Mrs Ngozi Nwora, said the gunmen dragged the young man a few metres away to the bridge and started shooting him. According to her, many people sustained injuries while scampering to safety because of the gunshots. “This is unbelievable, it is inexplicable how life has become so cheap in this country. People kill a fellow human being like a chicken while others watch helplessly. “With what I saw today, there is no value for life in our system again. The attackers did not mask up and they did not come with vehicles, they just walked leisurely,” she added. The state police spokesman, DSP Tochukwu Ikenga, who confirmed the incident, said it was a cult-related issue. According to him, preliminary investigation by the police revealed that the incident was a cult-related war. He however said that the police are on it and have taken charge of the area.
