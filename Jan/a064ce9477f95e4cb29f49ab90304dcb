Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, has lamented that there are some public servants in the state who are cultured and tutored in corruption, saying that such cannot be eradicated but can only be minimised. Mohammed stated the State Executive Council Meeting held at the the Government House Annex, Bauchi on Wednesday, He said, “If you look at the generation of public servants that we have today, they are those who have been tutored, who have been cultured with aspects of corruption, take and take from the system. “Even committee meetings, the ways they are being done are not ways that are known to those of us that are from the federal system. “Civil servants have taken alliances, if you don’t give money, they don’t move an inch. “We are not used to it, but I discovered that there is even a procedure, a law in Bauchi State allowing that, which makes it so difficult for us to change. The only thing is that we will minimise that culture. In stopping it completely, you will meet a brick wall.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
