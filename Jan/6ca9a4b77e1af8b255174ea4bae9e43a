The family of the late Timothy Adegoke has demanded that the trial of all suspects arrested in connection with the student’s death which occurred at Hilton Hotel, Ile-Ife, be held in Osun State. Adegoke, a Post Graduate Student of the Obafemi Awolowo University, had died under controversial circumstances Already, the police had filed charges against the owner of the hotel, Ramon Adedoyin, and six others before an Abuja High Court. But a letter written on behalf of the family by its counsel, Naim Adekilekun, obtained in Osogbo, Osun State on Thursday, said the demand was made since none of the elements of the offence to be tried by the FCT High Court took place in the Abuja. The family further said its demand was also to save the case a technical defeat the defence counsel may want to explore in order to get the suspects off the hook. The letter read in part, “we are of the firm view that since none of the elements of the offence to be tried by the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory happened or took place in the Federal Capital Territory, we shall be demanding that the case be tried at the High Court of Osun State being the court with the requisite jurisdiction to try the case. “There is nothing in Section 93 (1) and (2) of the Administration Of Criminal Justice Act 2015 that can make the Police to act otherwise. “Flowing from the foregoing we want to implore you sir, to use your good office to ensure that this case is prosecuted in the appropriate court, which is the High Court of Justice, Osun State.” Copyright PUNCH.
