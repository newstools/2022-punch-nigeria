The new Cardtonic app has created a buzz in the streets, there have been talks around town on how the upgrade took the public by surprise. We are here to catch you up to speed on all the sweet details around the launch. On the 7th of December, 2021 Cardtonic officially launched its new platform, after using the previous one for over 5 years, they decided it was time for something new, and boy we were shocked. The first commendable thing about the launch was the build-up and the days shortly after it. The social media campaign before the launch was impeccable, the efficient customer support assisting their users was very vital, and of course, the product itself was outstanding.  Another thing that struck us was a quote from the latest article on their website “The new design has been crafted to be faster than ever, easier to navigate, and more user-friendly. While we have tried to keep the user experience consistent with the former, we moved to a more customer-centric layout”. They have also assured users that although the platform has changed, their standards remain the same. There are a couple of notable points to understand. They mentioned that all mobile app users would need to update their Cardtonic Application, as the previous app would no longer operate. Gift card transactions before the 7th of December would be regarded as “Old transactions” but can still be accessed, and you would need to set a withdrawal pin before you can withdraw from your Cardtonic wallet. I personally enjoy the optical pleasure I derive from opening the app now. Let us know that thing/ those things that stand out to you on Cardtonic’s Redesigned platform.
