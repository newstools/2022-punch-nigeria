The Ogun State Government has threatened to deal with anyone engaged in illegal tree felling in the state’s forest reserves. The government said it would soon use soldiers against those who engage in afforestation in any of the forest reserves within the state. The state Commissioner for Forestry, Tunji Akinosi, stated this at a meeting with representatives of timber contractors, sawmill operators, and charcoal sellers in the state on Monday. Akinosi implored stakeholders in the forestry industry to cooperate with the government, in order to serve them better.
He also hinted that revenue being collected by the government will be reviewed upward. He said, “The present administration will not condone any illegal activities in government’s forest reserves, particularly from individuals or groups which have not registered with the government. “Registered contractors should also desist from unwholesome acts. “Let me warn those carrying out illegal activities in our reserves to desist as the government will no longer fold its arms and watch them destroy our forests. Anybody caught will have to face the music.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
