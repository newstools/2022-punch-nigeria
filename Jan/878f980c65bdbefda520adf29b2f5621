Ahead of the 2023 general election, moves have begun to drag the Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, into the presidential race as his campaign posters have surfaced in different parts of Kano State. Already, a group of Northern elders and youths have initiated an advocacy for presidential power shift to the Southern part of Nigeria with particular call on Emmanuel to join the race. The posters projecting Emmanuel’s presidential aspiration were sighted in the old Kano City, Fagge, Nasarawa Local Government Area of the state and some parts of the neighbouring Jigawa State. The posters, bearing the governor’s photo and Peoples Democratic Party’s logo, were tagged ‘Udom is coming for better Nigeria.’ Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
