Members of the Olubadan-in-Council elevated to Obas have agreed to drop their crowns and revert to High Chiefs. This decision was taken at the meeting of the council held at the Oja’ba Palace of the Olubadan of Ibadanland on Thursday. The meeting was attended by six members council, namely High Chiefs Owolabi Olakulehin (Balogun of Ibadanland), Tajudeen Ajibola (Otun Balogun), Lateef Adebimpe (Osi-Balogun), Kola Adegbola (Ashipa Balogun), Eddy Oyewole (Ashipa Olubadan) and Hamidu Ajibade (Ekarun Olubadan). The Otun Olubadan, Senator Lekan Balogun, had earlier told THE PUNCH that the affected obas are ready to revert to their original positions following the directive of the state governor, Seyi Makinde, that they should revert. Ajibola, who briefed journalists after the meeting, said they supported the governor on his decision to revert to the original concept of Ibadan tradition. ‘We agreed with the governor. All the processes leading to the nomination of successor to the late Olubadan were in line with the original concept of line of hierarchy in accordance with the Olubadan Chieftaincy Declaration,” he said.
