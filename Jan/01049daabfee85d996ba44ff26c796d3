The Coalition of Northern Groups, on Monday, expressed sadness over the death of Kano politician and former candidate of the National Republican Convention on the June 12, 1993, presidential election, Alhaji Bashir Othman Tofa, describing him as “a great statesman and mentor.” The CNG in a condolence message issued by its spokesperson, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, said it owed immeasurable gratitude to the late Bashir Tofa whose leadership, sacrifice, statesmanship, patriotism and unwavering commitment to the interests of the people of Northern Nigeria and citizens of Nigeria as a whole has few parallels. He said, “We mourn the passing of this great man from whose life and works we have drawn inspiration and we must strive, in all we do, to live by the personal and social values and standards he lived and set for himself.” The late Tofa, Suleiman said, was “a passionate believer of the organic links between generations who was always available for young people.” “The North certainly lost a great statesman, but the youth lost a mentor, a guardian, a living history and an embodiment of all the exemplary qualities young Northerners should strive to achieve. “We pray the Almighty Allah to overlook his shortcomings, forgive his gentle soul, admit him to Jannah and grant his family the fortitude to bear the loss”, CNG said.
