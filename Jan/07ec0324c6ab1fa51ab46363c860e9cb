Nollywood star, Toyin Abraham Ajeyemi, has knocked critics who ridicule her husband’s hard work. The actress, in an Instagram post on Wednesday night, sounded a note of warning to critics who assume that she was richer than her husband, Kolawole Ajeyemi, due to her popularity. She noted that whatever her husband has was from his hard work and not due to her popularity. The actress wrote, “I don’t usually do this and I am only going to address this just once and I hope this ends here. “People need to stop this mentality that famous people or the more famous ones are the richest in their family, relationships or even friendships. “Just because some people do not like to blow their own horns doesn’t mean they should be seen as less or incapable. “I’m speaking up because I won’t let people talk down on my husband who is a very hard working man and is doing a lot for me and the kids. Do not ridicule his hard work and what he stands for. “Everything he has, he’s worked for with his own sweat and he deserves it. “I am the last born of my family and you’d think I’m the richest just because I’m famous which is far from the truth. “It is 2022 please, we need to do better and stop this ill mannered mentality. “Celebrate people without trying to pitch them against another person or ridicule their hard work or give credit to another. It’s so old and needs to stop.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
