The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has hailed the immediate past Commissioner of Police in the state, Assistant Inspector General Hakeem Odumosu. Sanwo-Olu, during the pull-out parade held at the Police Training Ground in Ikeja GRA on Tuesday, said Odumosu came to the state with a wealth of experience. He said, “Hakeem Odumosu’s appointment in November 2019 as Commissioner of Police in Lagos came with much expectation, as it was believed that his arrival would bring the long-sought succour which many Lagosians yearned given the security challenges facing the state then. “These expectations came as a result of his very deep knowledge and understanding of what the security architecture of Lagos should be. He came with a wealth of experience, and new approaches to pursue effective policing. Those approaches led to an improvement in the security of lives and property in Lagos. “He discharged his duties with diligence and emerged as an outstanding police officer. I am happy to be at this occasion, which is a deserving farewell to AIG Hakeem Odumosu out of the Nigeria Police Force.” Reacting, Odumosu said he had no regret joining the force as the challenges he faced made him stronger. “I want to make it known that, despite challenges I faced in the course of my career, I have no regret joining the Force. The police properly groomed me to become a professional law enforcement officer that can stand tall among his peers anywhere in the world,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
