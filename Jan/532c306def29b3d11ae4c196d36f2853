Ogun State House of Assembly has summoned chairmen of some local government areas of the state that are allegedly involved in financial infractions. The assembly said it observed some infractions in the audit reports on the local government councils in the state. The assembly, through its Public Accounts and Anti-Corruption Committee, ordered the Permanent Secretary, Local Government Service Commission, to communicate its summons to all councils’ officials involved. The committee’s chairman, Musefiu Lamidi, issued the directive while concluding the consideration of the 2014-2019 audit reports on the 20 local government councils. He said the concerned officials were to provide further clarifications on the record books of their councils before the state lawmakers. He said “The committee has discovered the trend of illicit practices perpetrated by some officials, including non attachment of supporting documents to payment vouchers and the use of unqualified officials as conduit pipes to siphon council funds. “Others included nugatory payments, improper signing of payment vouchers and self procurements by some council chairmen amongst others which were against financial regulations, hence the need to prevent a re-occurrence with a view to sustaining transparency in the running of the councils.” The assembly also reaffirmed its invitation to all Heads of Local Government Administration, Treasurers and Directors, General Services and Administrations as well as Internal Auditors in all the Local Government councils for an interactive session on Wednesday, February 16, 2022.
