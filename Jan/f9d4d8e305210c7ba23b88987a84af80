Old students association of the Oduduwa College, Ile-Ife, has lamented activities of land grabbers encroaching on the land belonging to the school. They promised to embark on construction of perimeter fencing to check the perpetrators. Addressing newsmen as part activities to mark 90th anniversary of the school, the Chairman, organising committee, Sooko Ibiyemi, said the project would commence after the 90th anniversary celebrations. But to mark 90th anniversary of the school, Ibiyemi, said the association would inaugurate science and technology laboratories with equipments worth N25million, as well as, the statue of late Ooni of Ife, Oba Adesoji Aderemi, who was one of the founders of the school. Ibiyemi who commended present students, teachers and management of the school for keeping the culture of excellence, assured that the old students would continue to assist them, in a bid to ensure high academy and moral standard was maintained. He said, “The major challenge confronting Oduduwa College in terms of infrastructure is the encroachment of our premises. The land of Oduduwa College used to extend as far as Fajuyi road (Ile Ife). But now, we cannot see Fajuyi road again because it has been encroached upon. “We have taken various steps to actually take back our land and the old student association has taken that upon themselves to construct perimeter fencing for the school. “To mark 90th anniversary, apart from the laboratories projects which would be completed by June, we are also unveiling the statue of the founder, Oba Adesoji Aderemi inside the school premise to appreciate him for his dedication to the school founded in January 1932.” Copyright PUNCH.
