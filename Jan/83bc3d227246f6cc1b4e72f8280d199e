The Spokesman of the All Progressives Congress, Delta State chapter, Ogheneluemu Sylvester Imonina, has dumped the party. Imonina tendered his resignation in a letter titled ‘Resignation Of My Membership Of All Progressives Congress And Position As Acting State Publicity Secretary Of The Party.’ In the letter, he said, “I want to use this opportunity to thank the leaders of my ward, LGA, APC, Isoko Nation and members of the party across the state for the support given to me while I contributed my quota to the development of the party. “To everyone who supported me, I say a big thank you.” He, however, failed to state if he was defecting to another party.
