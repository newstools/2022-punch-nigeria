Eguavoen used a 4-3-3 formation with Union Berlin striker Taiwo Awoniyi leading the attack, flanked by Chidera Ejuke and Musa. In midfield, the former Eagles defender started Wilfred Ndidi, Joe Aribo and Kelechi Iheanacho, who played slightly behind Awoniyi. He also paired Kenneth Omeruo with William Troost-Ekong in central defence, with Ola Aina and Zaidu Sanusi deployed as right and left-backs respectively, while Maduka Okoye kept his place in goal.

Francis Uzoho came on for Okoye, while trio Omeruo, Troost-Ekong and Aina made way for Olisa Ndah, Semi Ajayi and Chidozie Awaziem. Brentford midfielder Frank Onyeka and Huesca’s Kelechi Nwakali replaced Ndidi and Aribo in central midfield.
