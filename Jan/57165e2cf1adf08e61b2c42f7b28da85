The Lagos State Commissioner for Tourism, Arts and Culture, Mrs Uzamat Akinbile-Yussuf, has said the government will revive the tourism industry in the state. Akinbile-Yussuf, in a statement on Monday, said the state’s tourism sector was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. She was quoted to have said this during the ministry’s retreat held on Victoria Island. She said, “This retreat provided an avenue for the entire workforce of the Ministry of Tourism Arts and Culture to look back into the past years, especially the year 2020 when the deadly COVID-19 hit the country and disrupted activities in different sectors, particularly the tourism and entertainment industry, which was almost brought to ground zero. “The ministry will henceforth be intentional and deliberate in its sponsorship drive, such that only credible organisations that align with the vision of the ministry would receive government sponsorship. The pandemic posed a great threat for the development of the tourism industry and this is why we have to devise means to keep the industry going by planning ahead while also envisaging the likely effects of the variants of COVID-19 on our collective goals and activities.” The Special Adviser to the Governor on Tourism, Arts and Culture, Mr Solomon Bonu, said the retreat would equip staff members of the ministry with the required knowledge. “This retreat was organised to equip all the staff members of the ministry with the required knowledge for a better relationship with our numerous stakeholders and for more effective service delivery. This will further boost their effectiveness based on the state’s tourism master plan and policies,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
