State lawmakers from the North East Zone elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress have endorsed the 2023 presidential aspiration of the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello. Their endorsement came shortly after their colleagues in all the North Central states endorsed Bello during their one-day extraordinary meeting in Abuja last week. In a communiqué issued on Thursday after the extraordinary meeting of the Forum of APC State Legislators of the North East Zone, held in Bauchi, the legislators declared their support for Bello. They also called on the leadership of the APC to zone the presidency to the Northern region of the country for fairness and equity. The communiqué read, “That the State Assembly legislators of the North East Zone endorse and state their unalloyed and unshaken support for the aspiration of the young and ebullient Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, who has against all odds decided to take the bull by the horn by aspiring to the office of the President come 2023. “Members thank him for heeding the clarion call for the Presidency of Nigeria to come to the North Central Zone and urge him to have no fear or doubt in his race for the exalted office as members of the North East Zone are solidly behind him. “The meeting also agreed to call on the leadership of our great party, APC, to zone the presidency to the Northern region of the country. This is because the North will rule for 10 years at the end of President Buhari’s tenure, while the Southern region has ruled for 14 years.” The communiqué was signed by Abubakar Ibrahim, Gombe State (Chairman of the Communiqué Committee); Bashir Mohammed, Taraba State (member); Nasir Abdulrahim, Gombe (member); and Abubakar Shellong, Adamawa State (member).
