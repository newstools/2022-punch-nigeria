THE Ebonyi State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has accused Governor David Umahi- led administration of using the South-East security network, Ebubeagu, to terrorise the residents of the state. Chairman of the PDP in the state, Tochukwu Okorie, who made the allegations during a press conference in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State capital, on Wednesday, said it was no longer news that the All Progressives Congress government had declared war on the hapless people of Ebonyi State. According to him, it was the duty of the party to continue the struggle to entrench democracy and democratic ideals in the country, especially in the state. He said, “For more than one year now, Ebonyi State, a hitherto free state, where people love one another irrespective of creed or belief, has become a stifling society, a killing field only comparable to North Korea. “The people of Ebonyi State have been under siege, a siege imposed by a government that all Ebonyians joined hands together to create. It is no longer news that the All Progressives Congress government of Governor David Umahi has declared a war on the hapless people of Ebonyi State. “In the last one year, more Ebonyians have died from Ebonyi State government-induced causes than from the COVID-19 and its various mutations in the state. In effect, an Ebonyian is more likely to die in the hands of the government of Ebonyi State than from any other cause. “The Ebubeagu security network, an illegal private militia created by Governor David Umahi has become an albatross for the people of Ebonyi State. Businesses in Abakaliki metropolis have closed down as the Ebubeagu boys constantly and consistently unleash terror on innocent traders and business people.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
