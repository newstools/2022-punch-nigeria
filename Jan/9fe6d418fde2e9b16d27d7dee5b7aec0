A Grade ‘C’ Customary Court in the Ode-Aje area of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, has been gutted by fire. The court, located on the premises of the Omoyeni Memorial Primary School, Ode-Aje, was reportedly destroyed by fire on Tuesday after the school closed for the day. Residents, who noticed the fire, were said to have put it out before it could spread to classrooms in the school. The cause of the fire had yet to be ascertained as of the time of filing this report. The Chairman, Oyo State Universal Basic Education Board, Dr  Nureni Adeniran, according to a statement, visited the scene of the incident on Wednesday to assess the damage done to the school. Adeniran, who led members of the board to the school, assured that the state government would do everything possible to prevent a recurrence. While sympathising with the headship of the customary court over the incident, he commended the school and residents for their efforts in putting the fire under control. He also hinted that the board would ensure collaboration with the council area, adding that the ravaged building would be rehabilitated. Adeniran said, “We commend you for your quick intervention, which prevented this fire from spreading to the classes here. “The board is grateful that there was no casualty and that this happened when pupils had left school. I enjoin you to ensure you monitor whatever these children are doing, and make sure all appliances are put off after school hours.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
