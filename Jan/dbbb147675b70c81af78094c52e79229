Sudanese security forces shot dead an anti-coup protester on Wednesday, pro-democracy medics said, as US diplomats visited for talks on the country’s months-old crisis. The protester in Khartoum’s twin city of Omdurman was “shot by live bullets of the forces” and hit in the torso, the Doctors’ Committee said. AFP
