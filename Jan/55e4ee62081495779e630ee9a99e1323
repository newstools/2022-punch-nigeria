A former Speaker of the Imo State House of Assembly, Lawman Duruji, has regained his freedom after five days in the den of suspected kidnappers. His kinsman, Kingsley Chukwu, confirmed the development to our correspondent on Thursday. Our correspondent gathered that the ex-lawmaker, who is said to be running for the Ehime Mbano/ Ihitte Uboma/ Obowo Federal Constituency seat on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, was released after rigorous financial negotiations. PUNCH Metro could not immediately ascertain how much was paid for his freedom, but it was gathered that his captors made an initial demand of N15m. Chukwu said, “Lawman Duruji, who was abducted a few days ago in his hometown, has regained his freedom to the glory of God. Let this affliction pass us by. Let our God arise and let the enemies scatter.  My youthful and mobile leader has been freed, thanks be to God.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
