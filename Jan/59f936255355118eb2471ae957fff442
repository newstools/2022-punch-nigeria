The Nigeria Labour Congress, Kano State Chapter, on Wednesday, mourned the passing of the former Chairman of Joint Public Service Negotiation Council, Comrade Mahmoud Maishanu. In a condolence message, jointly signed by the State Nigeria Labour Congress Chairman, Comrade Kabiru Ado Minjibir, and the Acting State Secretary, Comrade Hussain Budah, the Union regretted that Comrade Maishanu will be greatly missed, particularly for his humane 2006 Contributory Pension Scheme (Act) of Kano State Government being enjoyed by pensioners in the Sate. ”While he was alive, Comrade Mahmoud Maishanu demonstrated a high level of initiative and dexterity in handling labour issues, with various governments, both military and democratic dispensation. ”He was always very objective in dealing with matters of industrial relations, as he always champions the path of justice and fair play at all times. ”Indeed, the late Maishanu will be greatly missed. His humility, kindness and indefatigable strength and wisdom will be greatly missed by all, who were priveleged to work with him.” “A one-time Special Advisor, Labour Matters, during Ibrahim Shekarau’s administration, Maishanu, who died on January 11, 2022, following a protracted illness, was a specimen of old breed labour leaders, who was fearless, dogged and a symbol of traditional trade union best practices. ”On behalf of the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Kano State Council, we extend our heartfelt condolences to the entire labour veterans, workers and pensioners in Kano State and beyond for this irreparable loss,” the statement read.
