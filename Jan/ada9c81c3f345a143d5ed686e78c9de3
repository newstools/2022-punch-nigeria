A former Senator, representing Kaduna Central, Shehu Sani, has asked billionaire businessman, Aliko Dangote to ignore the call by the northern youths and concentrate on completing his refinery. Sunday PUNCH had reported that Northern youths, under the aegis of Arewa Youth Assembly, called on prominent private sector players to come to the nation’s rescue by joining the 2023 presidential race. According to them, Nigeria needs the managerial acumen and leadership skills of citizens, such as Alhaji Aliko Dangote, Femi Otedola, Mrs Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, and many others, who have made success for themselves in private ventures. Reacting, Sani in a tweet on his official Twitter handle wrote, “Dear Dangote, ignore those northern youths dragging you to politics, concentrate on your refinery. Make work no come stop.
