Fans on Sunday blamed newly signed Watford goalkeeper, Maduka Okoye, for his role in Nigeria’s exit at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. The Super Eagles suffered a 1-0 defeat to Tunisia to crash out of the AFCON tournament. Okoye failed to save Youssef Msakni’s long-range strike tow minutes after the restart as the Carthage Eagles booked a place in the quarter-finals of the tournament at the expense of Nigeria, who were tagged favourites ahead of the encounter. Disappointed fans immediately took to social media to blame the goalkeeper, who they believed should have done better with Msakni’s shot. A Twitter user with the name FunkeAkin wrote, “Maduka Okoye or whatever he is called should please go back to his fashion business, we are done!” With a photograph of former Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama, Max-Well, tweeted, “The legend we miss.” Callmesammylex echoed the opinion of Max-Well posting a picture of Enyeama with the caption, “The guy I’ll always miss and remember as a Nigeria goalkeeper.” Another Twiter user Olagbegi Star-struck said, “This guy reminds me of Victor Valdes of FC Barcelona then. Fine USELESS boy on the pitch.” Lukayo jokingly added, “This is the reason why Okoye could not keep that shot. Why Buhari go collect this jersey, video conference never dey enough.” Nnadi simply wrote, “Okoye too sexy for the shot.” Iam_Sannwalaw added, “Hello make una tell Okoye say I no wan see am for this Nigeria again.” Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.
