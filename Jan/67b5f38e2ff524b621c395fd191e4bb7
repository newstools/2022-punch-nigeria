The Catholic Archbishop of Lagos, Most Rev. Dr Alfred Martins, has called on the Federal Government to explore effective ways to address insecurity and economic inflation in the country. Martins said this in his New Year message signed by his Director of Social Communications, Rev. Fr. Anthony Godonu, on Saturday. He said, “The most pressing on people at this time is in the area of insecurity which claimed thousands of lives in the outgoing year. It is such a serious problem that government needs to explore new and better ways of dealing with this issue in such a way that Nigerians would be assured of better security in the new year. “Another area of concern that touches people every single day is the economy. The inflation level is too high even as the value of our currencies is nose-diving daily. We can all feel the consequences of high inflation rate and the value of our currency that has nose-dived. “As we begin the year 2022, the Federal Government must be take further steps to reappraise its economic policies and inject fresh ideas to cushion the effects of the harsh economy on the masses and mitigate the suffering that would arise from the projected economic challenges of the new year.” The archbishop also urged the people to be conscious of their safety and adhere to COVID-19 protocols. “Let us start each day with prayerful optimism and go about our daily activities with utmost caution and in strict adherence to the COVID-19 protocols,” he said.
