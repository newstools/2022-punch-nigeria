Coach Chris Danjuma has called up 26 players to the camp of the Falconets ahead of this month’s U-20 Women’s World Cup qualifying cracker against Cameroon’s Junior Lionesses. The list includes defender and captain Oluwatosin Demehin, goalkeeper Omini Monle, midfielders Basirat Amoo and Esther Onyenezide, and forwards Flourish Sebastine, Mercy Idoko and Precious Vincent. A 15-goal haul in their last three matches has taken the two-time World Cup finalists to the penultimate round of the African qualifying series for this year’s finals, which will hold in Costa Rica. The Falconets hammered their Central African Republic counterparts 7-0 away and 4-0 at home in the second round, before a 4-0 bashing of hosts Congo in Brazzaville. The Congolese opted not to travel to Nigeria for the reverse tie. Cameroon will host the first leg of the penultimate round in Douala on January 23, with the return leg at the Mobolaji Johnson Arena, Lagos a fortnight later. The winners book a date with the winners of the fixture between Senegal and Morocco for a slot at the 2022 U-20 Women’s World Cup in Costa Rica in August.
