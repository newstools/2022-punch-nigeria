The Lagos State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has described the death of the first female deputy Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Mrs Adetoun Adediran, as a great loss. Adediran, who was also a former women leader of the Lagos APC, was said to have died in the early hours of Wednesday after a brief illness. The spokesperson of the Lagos APC, Mr Seye Oladejo, confirmed this on Wednesday when contacted by our correspondent. He said, “She was a former women leader for Lagos Central, a consummate politician – a committed leader of her people who contributed immensely to the growth of the party and the development of Lagos State. She will be sorely missed.” Adediran was the deputy speaker of the House of Assembly representing Surulere I between 1999 and 2003. She has been buried at the Ikoyi Vaults according to Islamic rites. Meanwhile, the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, has described the deceased as one of the finest politicians. “As a principal officer at the House, she was passionate and active making sure her voice was heard among her colleagues who were mostly men,” he said. “We mourn her demise as it came at a time her experience and wisdom were still desired for the progress of our state. We mourn because death has snatched one of our finest politicians,” he said.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
