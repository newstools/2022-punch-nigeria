The Federal Capital Development Authority has ordered four hotels operating illegally on Mab Global Estate, Gwarimpa, Abuja, to shut down immediately. The Coordinator, Abuja Metropolitan Management Council, Alhaji Umar Shuaibu, handed down the directive during an inspection of the hotels on Wednesday. PUNCH Metro had reported how four buildings in the residential estate were illegally converted into hotels and drinking joints. Some residents had written to the Development Control Department of the FCDA in a letter dated November 5, 2021, imploring the agency to restore order by reverting the affected buildings to their original purpose. The AMMC officials observed that the building identified as Plot 400, which had a banner with the inscription, ‘Plot 400 luxury apartments’ at its gate, also had a swimming pool and a bar. The other residential apartments which were converted into hotels had no signposts indicating the activities going on in the buildings. Shuaibu, who led senior officials of the AMMC to the estate, told the hotel operators that his office would not condone their illegal actions and gave them 48 hours to shut down operations. “You must revert to the original purpose of the building, which is residential. This is a residential estate and no permit or approval has been issued to anyone to operate a hotel here,” he added. The team also marked a shopping complex on the estate for demolition. The officials inspected some buildings which were constructed in the green area. Shuaibu directed his men to furnish him with the building approval after the officials explained that the owner was not issued a permit when he applied about two months ago. Copyright PUNCH.
