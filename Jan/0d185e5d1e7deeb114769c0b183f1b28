In this episode of So This Happened, we reviewed the exit of Nigeria’s Super Eagles from the 2021 African Cup of Nations. Super Eagles lost 1-0 to Tunisia in their Sunday encounter in the AFCON Round of 16. Talk of restitution,  a man identified as Mr Timipade Kemepade, who wrote JAMB 21 years ago has sent an apology letter to the Board for being involved in examination malpractice years back. Kemepade blamed youthful exuberance for his misconduct. Lastly, we reviewed the story of five-year-old Hanifa who was abducted and killed by her school proprietor. A similar fate befell eight-year-old Asma’u, who was abducted and killed by her neighbour in Kaduna State despite collecting  N3m ransom. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
