The National Health Insurance Scheme has said it has been repositioned to meet the health needs of enrollees. To this end, the scheme said it had been directed to ensure value reorientation, accountability, transparency and acceleration toward universal health coverage. The Ondo State Coordinator of the NHIS, Adebiyi Adebisi, stated these at a one day stakeholders’ forum for healthcare providers, health maintenance organisations and enrollees in the state. The workshop had as its theme, ‘The new NHIS: New trend and updates on NHIS reform agenda’. According to the coordinator, the forum was part of the rebranding of the NHIS on the directive of the Executive Secretary of the agency, Nasir Sambo. He added that as part of the rebranding process, all inefficient health service providers would soon be removed from the scheme. “The agency will soon embark on the re-accreditation of all service providers in Ondo State to weed out inefficient ones from the scheme,” Adebisi stated. A senior employee in the Department of Standards and Quality Assurance, NHIS, Ondo State, Dr Raymond Akinkuotu, in a paper titled, ‘New NHIS landscape,’ said the agency was working towards restoring stakeholders’ confidence, addressing technical operational issues, and removing administrative bottlenecks, which were hitherto the regular complaints of beneficiaries. The stakeholders’ meeting brought together beneficiaries of the NHIS, enrollees, the healthcare providers and the health maintenance organisations for interaction and to enlighten them on their rights.
