Gunmen have killed a police inspector and injured another policeman during an attack at the Mgbidi Divisional Police headquarters in Imo State. It was learnt that the attack, which happened on Friday night, caused panic in the area as the hoodlums who came in a vehicle and policemen were engaged in a gun battle. Our correspondent gathered that the attackers opened fire on arrival at the police division but were by the policemen on duty. A source, who pleaded not to be mentioned, said, “One police inspector was killed during the attack. The hoodlums arrived around 9pm on Friday. They were met with stiff opposition by policemen who engaged them in a shootout. Unfortunately, a police officer died.” Confirming the development on Saturday, the spokesperson for the police in the state, Micheal Abattam, said ,”On January 14, 2022 at about 20:45 hours, the Command’s tactical teams at Mgbidi Police Station repelled an attack by some hoodlums who came in a white Hilux vehicle shooting indiscriminately and attempted to gain entrance into the station but were repelled by the ever gallant Imo command’s tactical teams and the policemen in the division who positioned themselves professionally. “Consequently, a vigorous and aggressive manhunt of the hoodlums is ongoing with the sole aim of tracking and arresting the fleeing hoodlums since they cannot go far because of the huge damage done to them. However, in the course of the attack, a police inspector lost his life, while another sustained a minor bullet injury on his hand.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
