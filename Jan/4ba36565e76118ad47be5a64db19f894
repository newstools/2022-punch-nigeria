The government of the United States of America on Thursday pledged to support Nigeria in its efforts to combat modern-day slavery and all forms of human trafficking and smuggling. Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Abuja, Kathleen FlitzGibbon, said this at an event organised to commemorate the 2022 National Human Trafficking Awareness Month. The event, held in collaboration with the DEVATOP Center for African Development under its “TALKAM” Human Rights Project, had the theme “Improving awareness on Human Trafficking and increasing Reportage of Cases’. According to FlitzGibbon, human trafficking has taken various forms and is also known as modern-day slavery which requires collaborative efforts to effectively tackle. She said that in Nigeria, modern-day slavery had continued to thrive under the guise of relatives taking young girls and boys out of the villages to the city to give them education. She said that the training of advocates by DEVATOP center would help bring some of the tricks to the limelight and sensitise those in rural communities so that they do not fall victims. “Human Trafficking has no place in a society that values freedom and the rule of law, hence for these reasons, the United States stands with Nigeria in its fight against trafficking,” she said. Director-General, National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons, Fatima Waziri- Azi, commended DEVATOP Center for African Development for its advocacy which was yielding visible results. Waziri-Azi, represented by Roseline Abare, NAPTIP’s Chief Intelligent Officer, Public Enlightenment Department said the agency was pleased to work with the center full of youths with drive. “It is also very commendable that TALKAM project, with the support of the U.S. Embassy, Abuja, is marking this year’s National Human Trafficking Month in graduating 40 human rights advocates. “Driving the nexus between the visions of the DEVATOP Center and the responsibilities of NAPTIP. “As an NGO that is also led by the youths, we, NAPTIP applaud your aggressive nature towards your impacting over a million people through training, sensitisations, and awareness campaigns. “NAPTIP is pleased to work with you and wishes you more success in your endeavours,” Waziri-Azi said.
