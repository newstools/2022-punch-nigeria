The Police Command in the Federal Capital Territory has arrested three persons over the alleged murder of a medical practitioner, Obisike Ibe, and his friend in Abuja. The Commissioner of Police in charge of FCT, Babaji Sunday, disclosed this at a news conference on Tuesday in Abuja. He said that Ibe, a staff member of Zenith Lab and Kidney Centre, Abuja and his friend, Ezekiel Edoja, both of House D2, 24 Street, Games Village Estate, Abuja, were allegedly murdered by the suspects. Sunday said that the command had, since the receipt of the information, deposited the corpse at the morgue and embarked on an aggressive manhunt, amidst painstaking investigations. He said that the perpetrators of the dastardly act also carted away an envelope containing about $1,000, the mobile phone of the doctor, his ATM card and a vehicle. He said that the ATM card was used to withdraw money to the tune of N2 million from the deceased account on December 13, 2021. The CP said that the three suspects arrested, upon interrogation, confessed to having plotted and committed the offence. (NAN)
