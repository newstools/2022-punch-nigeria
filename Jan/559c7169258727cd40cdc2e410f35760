This was announced by Nurses on Air on their official Facebook page on Tuesday, as they mourn the death of Oluwagbemiga and his fiancee, who was also a nurse. The announcement read, “It’s so sad to hear the passing of a dear colleague, Nurse Kareem Oluwagbemiga, admin of @nursingcouncillecture, and his fiancee. “They both died after being a victim of an accident on Jos-Abuja road.
