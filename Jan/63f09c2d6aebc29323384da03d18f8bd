The  Lagos State Government has said the present administration will improve the lives of residents of Bariga community through tourism and arts. The Special Adviser on Tourism, Arts and Culture, Mr Solomon Bonu, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday. Bonu was quoted to have said this during the annual Footprints of David Arts Festival, held at Arobadade Street, Bariga. He said, “The state government remains committed to the improvement of lives of residents of Bariga and its environs, especially in the area of tourism, arts and culture. “The state is ready to tap into the potential in tourism, arts and culture in the community, by executing several projects for the development of the community. “This is in line with the current administration’s THEMES agenda, which is aimed at improving the socio-economic outlook of the state.” Bonu also assured residents that the government would fulfil the promise made to the community. “The Footprints of David’s crew presented a play for Governor Sanwo-Olu last year at Glover Memorial Hall, and this necessitated my visit to this community some time ago with the General Manager of Lagos State Urban Renewal Agency, Faidat Shomade; we went around and looked at how we can improve the lives of these children to make them better for tomorrow. “Any moment from now, we will come back to fulfil that promise made by the governor,” he added.
