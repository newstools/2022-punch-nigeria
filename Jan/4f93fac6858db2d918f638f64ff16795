The remains of a student of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, Timothy Adegoke, who died in controversial circumstances have been buried. The remains of the 37-year-old Master of Business Administration student were brought to the Eruwa Town Hall in a white casket with hundreds of youths in procession. The body of the accountant was buried beside the house he built for his parents in the New Eruwa part of Eruwa town. Eruwa is the headquarters of the Ibarapa East Local Government Area of Oyo State. Family members, friends and beneficiaries of the deceased’s acts of kindness wept during the brief service conducted by Revd. Michael Hungbenu, the founder of Celestial Deliverance Church of Christ. The grieving widow of the deceased, Bolatito, wept uncontrollably and was reluctant to leave the graveside despite pleas. She shouted the name of her late husband and recounted some fond memories they had together while she hurled curses at the killers of her husband, whom he said was denied of burying his parents. The bereaved woman became inaudible due to wailing. Service of tributes was first held at the Eruwa Town Hall where hundreds of youths, members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria, and OAU students, among others had gathered. His brother, Gbade, urged those present to support them to ensure that justice is served in the case which is already in court.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
