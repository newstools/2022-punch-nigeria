A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, Bode George, has expressed concern over the increasing rate of insecurity in the country. While faulting federal policing, George suggested that community policing should be embraced. He described community policing as the panacea to tackling the lingering security challenges facing the country during an interview on Channels Television’s Newsnight which will air later this evening. The politicians urged governors to prioritise the protection of lives and properties. He said, “The beauty of it is that you are sure to contain your local governments; the people, their lives and properties day and night, and they (those running it) would be people who will be hired within that community. “They know who lives there, who does this, and if you see a stranger coming into the community at night; you have the right to challenge. They know everybody around and there is nothing better in terms of policing than that. “What is the first job of anybody in government? Protection of lives and properties. That is the number one job,” the former military governor of Ondo State maintained. “If you cannot do that, then you are not fit to be the governor of that state.” The PDP leader also backed the creation of a regional security outfit. He said, “Maybe some states will have more because they can afford more,” Bode George said in response to comments that funding will be a major challenge in running community policing. “Why are we thinking that the only way to provide security for lives and properties is by running a federal police? It is not working.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
