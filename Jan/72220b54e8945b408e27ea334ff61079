The Governor of Borno State, Prof. Babagana Zulum, has signed the 2022 appropriation bill of N269.9bn into law. The state House of Assembly had passed the bill, with an increase of N1.7bn from the N267.9bn proposed by the executive in December. The bill was presented to the governor on Monday at the council chamber of the Government House by the Speaker, Abdulkareem Lawan, in the presence of other state executive council members. While presenting the budget, Lawan said the increment of N1.7bn became necessary in order to cover areas of urgent public attention that were not captured in the proposed budget. While signing the bill into law, Zulum commended the state legislature for a job well done and advised the commissioners and heads of agencies to be prudent in their spending in line with the provision of the budget. He said, “It has not been easy for our administration in the past two and half years. The provision of law is very clear about the budget. The commissioners are therefore warned to be very prudent in spending the funds. No commissioner should use the funds for any project that is not captured in the budget. “You must learn to stick by the law and ensure you adhere to the provisions of the budget for accountability and transparency.” Copyright PUNCH.
