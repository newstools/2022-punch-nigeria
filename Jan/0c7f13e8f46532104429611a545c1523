Osun State House of Assembly on Sunday said it has commenced a probe into the audit query issued by the Office of the State Auditor General to the Bursar of Osun State College of Education, Ila, Olanrewaju Oyedeji. The query signed by the State Auditor General, Folorunsho Adesina, had advised the state government to declare an emergency on the institution’s bursary department after the discovery of financial irregularities in the school’s accounts. The query described the 2018 and 2019 financial statements of the college as unreliable. “With the gross financial irregularities observed in the accounts of Osun State College of Education Ila-Orangun as duly established by the provision of the Financial Regulation and other extant laws, the state government is hereby advised to declare a state of emergency on the Bursary Department of Osun State College of Education Ila-Orangun since the Auditor General has uncovered major irregularities perpetrated in the college’s accounts,” the query read. But replying to the query, the college’s acting Provost, Prof. Jimoh Afolabi, in a letter addressed to the Commissioner for Education; the Speaker, Osun State House of Assembly and the Chairman, Osun Assembly Committee on Public Accounts, obtained on Sunday, accused the Auditor General of witch-hunt.
