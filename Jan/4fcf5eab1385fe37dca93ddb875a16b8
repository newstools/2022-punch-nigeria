The Ekiti State Commissioner of Police, Tunde Mobayo, has declared a 75-year-old retired military officer, Adeyemi Williams, missing. Mobayo said Williams, a retired officer of the Nigerian Army, left his No. 29 Alafia Lodge, Erio Ekiti, home about three weeks ago for an unknown destination and had not returned home. This came five days after the police declared a 16-year-old Point of Sale terminal operator on Oke Bola Street in Ado Ekiti, Faith Esther Olatunji, missing. The CP said in a press release by the Police Public Relations Officer, Sunday Abutu, on Saturday, that “all efforts made to know his (Williams’) whereabouts proved abortive.” “He (Williams) is 78 years old; he has dotted spots on his face, is six feet tall and speaks English and Yoruba languages fluently,” the statement said. Abutu stated that the police had begun investigations “to unravel his whereabouts,” adding that the command was appealing to members of the public to supply relevant information that could help the police to locate Williams’ whereabouts. “Anyone with useful information concerning his whereabouts should kindly contact the nearest police station or call the PPRO on 09064050086,” he added.
