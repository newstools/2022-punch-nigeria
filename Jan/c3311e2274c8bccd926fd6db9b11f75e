Nigerian singer and songwriter, Simisola Kosoko, simply known as Simi, has advised up-and-coming artistes on the need to ‘sell’ themselves. The singer said this while commenting on the social media pages of growing artistes. She had earlier asked to listen to new and ‘fresh sounding’ artistes that are yet to gain exposure. Simi wrote on her Instagram story on Thursday, “Y’all, if you know any fresh-sounding artistes that are still underground, show me. I want to feed my ears.” Expressing her disappointment on the social media pages of up-and-coming artistes, the mother-of-one also took to her Instagram story on Friday, to encourage them to do better. She wrote, “You are a ‘serious’ growing artist and you have only three posts on your page; a picture of the sunset, one of aeroplane, and one of your shoe. “Caption – Lost, but don’t find me. Nothing with your music in it. That’s not a great look. If you want it bad, always be selling yourself. “Leave the mysterious sh*t for when you’ve won! Even then, still leave it.” Copyright PUNCH.
