Super Eagles player Alex Iwobi has penned an appreciation message to fans of the Nigerian football team two days after the team lost 1-0 to Tunisia in the last-16 match that had them crash out of the 2022 AFCON competition. In his post, on Twitter on Tuesday, the Everton winger thanked fans of the national team for their support, acknowledged that they “deserve more,” then promised that the Super Eagles will be back to “fight for our nation.” “Moments of joy can quickly turn into pain and anguish. As much as it’s a part of football, we came for more. Our fans who shared these moments with us both in Cameroon and across the world deserved more,” Iwobi wrote on Twitter. “The beauty of the game is the next moment of jubilation is never too far round the corner. We will be back to fight for our nation, stronger. We owe it to you, and I owe it to myself. Thank you for all the words of support and encouragement – it doesn’t go unnoticed.” Iwobi came on as a substitute in the second half of the round-of-16 game and was booked after a tackle on Tunisia’s lone goalscorer of the match Youssef Msakni. A VAR review, however, saw Iwobi shown a controversial red card. Since Sunday’s game, Iwobi has been heavily criticised by fans for his performance in the match against Tunisia. Copyright PUNCH.
