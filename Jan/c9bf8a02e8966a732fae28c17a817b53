Air Peace CEO, Allen Onyema, has promised to reward the Super Eagles with N50m should they return to the country with the coveted Africa Cup of Nations trophy. The three-time champions began their AFCON campaign with a 1-0 win over Egypt on Tuesday at the Roumdé Adjia Stadium in Garoua, with Leicester City forward, Kelechi Iheanacho, grabbing the winner with a superb strike in the 30th minute. With the 1-0 win, the Eagles are N10m richer courtesy of Onyema, who had promised to pay the players the sum per goal against the Pharaohs. “For every goal you score today (Tuesday) against Egypt I’ll give the team N10m. If you score five or 10, just multiply it,” Onyema said in a halftime video posted online. “At the end of the day, when you bring this cup home, I’ll wait for you with N50m. It’s not about money, it’s about the unity and progress of our nation because when you get back to Nigeria, people from the east, west, south and north are celebrating. You unify Nigeria, you are the unifying factor we need,” Onyema added. In September 2021, Onyema redeemed a N20m pledge to the Eagles for defeating Cape Verde 2-1 away from home in a 2022 World Cup qualifying match. Air Peace is the official airline of the Super Eagles.
