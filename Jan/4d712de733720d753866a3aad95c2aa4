The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, has declared restriction of movement from 11pm to 5am daily, following sudden rise in incidents of armed robbery within his domain. Confirming the development in a chat with Sunday PUNCH, Lowa Adimula of Ife, High Chief Abraham Adekola, who is third in line to Ooni, said Ooni-in-Council had to put up the measure on behalf of the monarch to check criminality in the town. Adekola, who disclosed that the Ooni travelled to Sokoto for an official assignment, said the chiefs had to act after briefing the royal father in a bid to arrest the situation. He said, “It is true, restriction of movement has been imposed in the name of Baba Ooni. He is in Sokoto on official assignment but after we consultation with him, we agreed to impose restriction from 11pm to 5am daily until the situation improves. “During the restriction, no night party, vigil or movement. It is just to check criminality in the town. “Armed robbers had invaded Ife. They killed and maimed people. We just have to act to arrest the situation and since we imposed restriction, the situation has improved.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
