Newcastle have agreed a fee with Lyon in the region of £30m to sign midfielder Bruno Guimaraes and are also targeting a deal to sign Brighton defender Dan Burn. It is understood Brazil international Guimaraes will undergo a medical in his homeland on Wednesday. A statement said, “Olympique Lyonnais categorically denies the false information disseminated by many media reporting an agreement between Newcastle and OL for the transfer of Brazilian international midfielder Bruno Guimaraes. “In this transfer window period where the slightest rumour is often presented as reality, Olympique Lyonnais reminds that only information officially released by the club is to be taken into consideration.” It is not the first time Lyon issued such denial over a transfer. In 2019, the club denied they had agreed to sell Ferland Mendy to Real Madrid. Eight days later, the left-back completed a move to the Bernabeu. The Mapgies have wanted to sign a left-footed centre-back all window to partner Jamaal Lascelles. Brighton and Hove Albion's Dan Burn during the Premier League match at Selhurst Park, London. But they have so far failed in their attempts to sign Sven Botman, Diego Carlos and Benoit Badiashile. Burn – a boyhood Newcastle fan born in nearby Blyth – is now a top target with less than seven days left of the window. The 29-year-old has entered the final 18 months of his Brighton contract. The 6ft 7in defender, who joined Brighton from Wigan in 2018, can also play left-back. Arsenal were among a number of clubs interested in signing Guimaraes, who has also been watched closely by Manchester United and PSG, but Eddie Howe’s side look to be closing in on the 24-year-old’s signature. Guimaraes has made 25 appearances in all competitions for Lyon this season, registering six assists. He has three caps for the Brazil national team.
